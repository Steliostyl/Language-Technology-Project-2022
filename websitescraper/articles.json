The sister of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was speaking at the Global Supertrends Conference 2022 on Wednesday. The Web3 is a hypothetical, future version of the internet based on blockchain technology \u2014 an \"ideal utopia,\" said Zuckerberg. \"But \u2026 that's not what's happening. What's happening in reality, is chaos.\" The founder and CEO of Zuckerberg Media, a production company and marketing consultancy, added, \"You're the only one watching your own back and your own assets, people are spending time protecting themselves by setting up so many different wallets and protecting their identity and that's not contributing to development in the area.\" Zuckerberg, who was an early employee at Meta \u2014 formerly known as Facebook \u2014 explained that various metaverses are now acting as \"their own walled garden,\" in which users are unable to use their assets across platforms. The metaverse can be loosely defined as a virtual world where people live, work and play. With cryptocurrency, users can buy and develop virtual land or dress their own avatars. \"Right now, I'm on Decentraland, my son is on Roblox, my other son is on Fortnite. That's great \u2014 we're all in the metaverse. [But] we have no interaction with one another,\" she said. \"In order to really unlock the potential [of Web3], we're going to need to figure out a system where there's interoperability. What you have goes with you wherever you are, [and] we're not there yet,\" Zuckerberg added. However, according to Zuckerberg, that's easier said than done because no company running a metaverse right now wants to give up control or \"share that ownership.\" \"That's why it's not we're not seeing that kind of consumer mainstream adoption yet because there needs to be a world where you leave the house with one wallet. And you need to see that same behavior online also.\" She added that Web3 needs experts who have been involved in the global banking system and Web2 \u2014 the internet that we know today \u2014 to lend a \"protective layer.\" The need for such experts is all the more important because it has been \"too easy\" for users to be scammed or lose all their assets in Web3, said Zuckerberg. \"There needs to be more protections for consumers \u2026 I think we will wind up [with] web 2.7, where there is some centralization, keeping people safe, but the ability to port your assets with you to any site.\" Another thing that needs to be improved in Web3 is user-friendliness, she added. \"It should not take 45 steps to set up a cryptocurrency wallet, buy a currency and enter the metaverse. It needs to [be] one-stop, beginner-friendly.\" The metaverse may still be in its infancy, but Zuckerberg pointed out that sectors like real estate will be \"extremely valuable.\" \"Wherever there's scarcity \u2026 there's value. I think the big question will just be, is there scarcity in the metaverse and if there is, there will be value in real estate there,\" she added. According to data from MetaMetrics Solutions, real estate sales in the metaverse surpassed $500 million in 2021 and could double in 2022. Zuckerberg said that education and training will be another \"huge area\" for opportunities and revenue. \"Especially in this new age where workers are remote, it is very difficult to upskill remote workers \u2026 I think training in the metaverse, education in an interactive way, is going to become crucial for every business that has a remote work,\" she added. \"We're really just scratching the surface of what we're going to see.\""},

As economies reopened after the pandemic, companies in the hospitality, retail and entertainment sectors ramped up hiring, said Feon Ang, Asia-Pacific managing director at the professional networking platform. All three countries saw an increase in job postings on LinkedIn for jobs in the accommodation sector, such as hotels, motels, casino hotels and bed-and-breakfast inns. According to data collected by LinkedIn, paid job postings for careers in Australia, India and Singapore increased in June compared to a year ago, with the following sectors seeing the most growth: 1. Accommodation, up 62%\n2. Retail jobs, up 46%\n3. Financial services, up 25% 1. Accommodation, up 65%\n2. Construction, up 40%\n3. Real estate and equipment rental services, up 25% 1. Accommodation, up 15%\n2. Transport and logistics, up 31%\n3. Entertainment providers (businesses involved in performances, events, and exhibitions), up 100% However, jobs in Singapore's health care, education and construction industries were all down by more than 30%, according to LinkedIn. Ang noted that the cutback of job postings for Singapore's construction sector was likely due to measures introduced by the government to cool the private and residential property market. Although there's an increase in hiring rates across the three countries, there was less competition among job seekers in June compared to one year ago, LinkedIn data showed. On average, there was a more than a 50% drop in applications for paid job postings on LinkedIn in Australia, India and Singapore \"Even as job postings rise, workers are being more selective in picking their next role, and so competition for jobs on average is down,\" said Ang. \"This means that workers are in a position to demand more out of work, and have higher expectations of what they want in a job \u2013 and that's a healthy sign,\" she added. In both Australia and Singapore, paid job postings that offered remote work options fell. Paid listings in Australia fell by 8% in June compared to a year ago, although sentiment for flexible working arrangements was still strong. Opportunities that offered remote working options received two times more applications on average, according to LinkedIn. In Singapore, paid job postings that allowed employees to work from home fell from 8% in the first quarter to 6.7% in the second quarter. But unlike employees in Australia, LinkedIn observed that interest in flexible working arrangements seemed to be waning in Singapore. Employers in India felt differently, according to the data. Paid job postings in the South Asian country which offered remote work options remained relatively constant throughout the year and there wasn't particularly more interest in jobs with remote options. \"Postings with remote options received only 1.1x more applications on average relative to their absolute share of all job postings in both quarters,\" said LinkedIn."},
{"url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/26/action-on-climate-change-can-boost-global-economy-economist-says.html", "title": "Action on climate change can provide a shot in the arm for the global economy, economist says", "tag": "Investing in supertrends", "author": "Jonathan Keane", "datetime": "2021-07-26 05:58:28", "paragraphs": " Ramping up investment in policies and technologies to tackle climate change could play a significant role in the global economy's recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. In a recent note, Charles Dumas, chief economist at U.K.-based investment research firm TS Lombard, said that action on climate change is often criticized as moving too slowly. However, with governments increasing spending to aid their post-Covid economies, they may start catching up. A key tenet of this is the ever-decreasing cost of electricity per megawatt hour, according to figures from TS Lombard, with costs of solar, offshore and onshore wind dropping over the last 10 years, while gas and coal have remained largely the same. \"Effectively by 2030 the cost of renewable electricity is going to be half that of coal and gas sourced electricity,\" Dumas told CNBC. These trends will bring many of the various pledges to reach net zero more closely in sight. The fatal floods in Germany in recent weeks have put the impacts of climate change firmly in the spotlight again but they are only the latest in a series of devastating extreme weather events of late, including the sprawling wildfires in Oregon. Amid this backdrop, the United Nations Climate Change Conference, better known as COP26, will meet in Glasgow in November. It will mark one of the most significant multilateral meetings on climate since the Paris agreement. Dumas said that as COP26 approaches, governments need to understand their key priorities, and among them should be infrastructure investments as numerous technological and engineering challenges continue to obstruct renewable energy. \"I think the intermittency problem is pretty serious and it's not just that the sun goes down at night,\" Dumas said. In the case of solar power, output can be mixed depending on the location of infrastructure like solar farms. \"There's huge variation with sunny days in winter and sunny days in the middle of summer so the intermittency takes on a very big seasonal aspect,\" Dumas said. \"You can have vicious weather for a long time in the middle of December or January and lo and behold you wouldn't want to be depending on solar power.\" Energy transmission could be another bottleneck, he said. While the developing world, including several African nations, has great potential in developing sites for generating solar power, that power needs to move easily. \"The issue of transmission technology is really major. If you want Chad to be the new Saudi Arabia, because of the Sahara Desert there's a lot of sun there, but you want the electricity to be used in Europe then you're talking about some expensive processes and processes needing a lot of research and a lot of further investment.\" Storage and carbon capture are all areas that require hefty investment, Dumas added, if governments are to reach their net-zero targets. \"What we need is a very clear public policy lead in order to get anywhere near these net zero promises and I suspect that actually what it's going to be about is a carbon tax, which the Americans may resist but will be necessary,\" he said. Paul Steele, chief economist at an independent policy research institute called the International Institute for Environment and Development, said that climate action and renewable energy investments will serve the dual purpose of tackling the climate crisis while creating jobs for the post-Covid economy. \"One of the priorities coming out of Covid is to create labor intensive employment. Both in developed and developing countries, you can provide labor intensive employment through renewable energy,\" Steele said. One example, he said, was the retrofitting of boilers in homes in the U.K., which would help push the country toward its climate targets and create new jobs while being relatively inexpensive in the grand scheme of things. Steele said that investments to drive a climate-friendly economy cannot be short term or have quick goals. He pointed to the various government support schemes for the airline industry, which has been battered by the pandemic. Just this week, the European courts gave the nod to a $2.9 billion bailout for Air France-KLM's Dutch business. Bailout funds like these should be tied to sustainability commitments by the airline industry, he said, but that can be a dicey proposition to get over the line. \"Governments aren't making the connections enough and traditionally treasuries and particularly the ministries of transport are still dominated by road building lobbies and people who like to build highways and increase transport rather than people who want to invest in sustainable alternatives.\"  "},

Here\u2019s what it costs \u2014 and how they pay for it", "tag": "CNBC Travel", "author": "Monica Buchanan Pitrelli", "datetime": "2022-08-22 05:22:04", "paragraphs": " Ernestas Tyminas felt \"stuck\" in his role as a marketing manager at a newspaper in Colorado Springs, Colorado. So he requested two months off to backpack through Asia, he said, landing in Beijing in January 2019. \"On the first day \u2026 I meet this one,\" he said, gesturing to Darina Karpitskaya, sitting by his side. The couple, speaking to CNBC via video from Dubai, said they met via the travel app Couchsurfing, which links solo travelers together. Karpitskaya, 31, and a flight attendant at the time, had been grounded in Beijing for two days because of mechanical problems with her return flight. Though more solo travelers agreed to meet that day, Tyminas and Karpitskaya were the only two who showed up. After one day together, they planned to meet again in Asia one month later. Karpitskaya returned to Asia, and the couple's second date was a \"crazy one-month adventure\" to Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines, said Tyminas, 29. It was in the Philippines, he said, that he decided he wasn't going back to his old life. \"We were \u2026 laying on the beach under the stars,\" he said. \"We were kind of starting to dream about this lifestyle.\" After returning to Colorado, Tyminas quit his job, sold his belongings and moved to Europe, he said. Karpitskaya wasn't quite there yet, saying, \"At first it sounded like: Oh my God, you're quitting your job. You're moving from America. Maybe it's too soon. But at the same time, when I came back from that trip I felt like I'm living a life that I'm not enjoying.\" Tyminas flew from Denver to Paris with his dog \u2014 an 82-pound Borzoi, once known as the \"Russian Wolfhound,\" named Cosmo, who is over 6 feet tall on his hind legs. \"They gave me three rows of seats, and the dog was just laying on the floor,\" he said. From there, the couple traveled often \u2014 to places like Italy and Iceland \u2014 but not yet full time, they said. Then Karpitskaya got what she called her \"dream job\" \u2014 a position with Emirates airline. She moved to Dubai, but the couple continued to meet and travel together. Then Covid hit, and Karpitskaya accepted four months of unpaid leave from her job. \"We said: We have four months \u2014 we can go explore whatever is open,\" said Tyminas. The trio \u2014 including Cosmo, who traveled in a huge bed in the back of their SUV \u2014 traveled first to Croatia, then slowly across much of Europe, including many former Soviet states, said Karpitskaya. She never returned to her job, and couple have been traveling ever since, she said. In the beginning, they spent between $1,000 and $2,000 a month \u2014 all from savings \u2014 by staying in cheap accommodations, cooking at home and seeking out free activities, said Tyminas. As money started to dry up, Tyminas took several online jobs, which netted between $2,000 and $3,000 a month, which wasn't far from his salary of $3,300 in Colorado, he said. But the work was cumbersome, and it \"felt like I still had a job,\" he said. So the couple decided to open a marketing and graphic design company, despite the fact that \"we didn't know a lot,\" said Tyminas. They reached out to thousands of people, they said, often working late into the night. Potential customers would ask, \"Can you design book covers?\" \"Can you promote music?\" Tyminas said his response was always the same, \"Of course I can.\" In reality, he was learning on the job, he said, relying on YouTube, Google and online research. But clients were very happy, he said. \"They paid me half of what they would pay other marketing agencies and the results, they said, were better than they had before,\" said Tyminas. In the first month, the couple made $6,000, he said. Now, sometimes they earn several thousand dollars in a day working with real estate companies and music labels, he added. \"We write blogs for people \u2014 we do everything,\" said Tyminas. Plus \"we don't have to report to anybody. We're our own bosses.\" In the past six months, the couple said they spent an average of $4,000 a month. More than half goes to accommodations, which vary by location \u2014 from $3,100 per month in Dubai to $1,500 in Lisbon, Portugal, they said. They limit stays in expensive locations, like Switzerland, to no more than a week, they said. One way to save money is booking monthlong stays on Airbnb, which cuts down average nightly rates and reduces service and cleaning fees, said Tyminas. But even when they bounced from place to place to visit Europe's Christmas markets last year, they still ended up paying about $2,500 that month, he said. Karpitskaya said she doesn't want these costs to scare people because they spent far less in the beginning. At the time, they spent about 80-100% of their income, but now Tyminas said \"we spend about 30% and \u2026 save the rest.\" The couple told CNBC they still travel modestly \u2014 no five-star hotels \u2014 and they still cook most meals at home. But they spend more on activities that they film for their YouTube channel Dream Team Travels \u2014 another \"completely self-taught\" venture, they said. A life of constant travel isn't all fun and games, they said. They encounter dirty Airbnbs and hosts who cancel reservations at the last minute. They've also had their camera equipment and clothing stolen twice \u2014 once in Mexico, and more recently in France \u2014 plus an attempted theft of their belongings from their car in Barcelona, while they were sitting in it. They have also thought about settling down when they find a place they really love, such as the beaches of Portugal or the French Riviera, said Tyminas. \"But then \u2026 we drive somewhere else and we're like this place is also just as good,\" he said. When Russia invaded Ukraine, quickly occupying the Kherson region where Karpitskaya's parents live, Tyminas emailed CNBC to say that they'd stopped traveling for the time being. \"The first few weeks we didn't even leave our apartment,\" he said. \"We spent a lot of time arranging transportation for civilians as well as many dogs from shelters to be taken out of dangerous regions for adoption in Europe.\" By the summer, they had resumed traveling, but were still helping to evacuate Karpitskaya's family. \"Just a week ago we were able to finally get Darina's parents out of Ukraine,\" said Tyminas, adding that they are currently in his family's home in Lithuania. \"We also did a trip to Romania to pick up Darina's sister and her five-month-old baby from the border and took her to live in Germany.\" The couple are now in Malaysia, they said, and plan to explore Southeast Asia for the next two months."},

The local government approvals allow Baidu's Apollo Go robotaxi business to eliminate the cost of human personnel in some instances. The initial scale of the permits is small: 10 robotaxis divided between two suburban areas of Wuhan and Chongqing, two major Chinese cities. In April, Baidu and rival robotaxi operator Pony.ai received approval from a Beijing suburban district to operate robotaxis without a human driver. But the Chinese capital still requires human staff to sit in the robotaxi with passengers. Municipal authorities across China have issued an increasing number of permits in the last year that allow robotaxi companies to operate and charge fares in selected areas. In the U.S., Alphabet's Waymo and General Motors ' subsidiary Cruise can already run public robotaxis with no human staff in the vehicles. Laws for testing robotaxis and charging riders vary by city and state. Baidu claimed it has received more than one million orders for robotaxi rides. In the first three months of the year, the company said it operated 196,000 rides. Baidu is set to release second quarter results on Aug. 30."},

He was speaking at the 2022 Global Supertrends Conference. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced in May that the country will take firm steps to restart idled nuclear power plants to stabilize energy supply and prices. In 2011, the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant was hit by a massive earthquake and tsunami, which killed nearly 16,000 people and caused the world's worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986. Though there have been reservations among the Japanese public over the use of nuclear energy, particularly when it comes to the issue of safety, Tanaka said the future of nuclear power is now safer, and stressed the importance of minimizing risk and maintaining \"peaceful use.\" Tanaka attributed the increase in public support to the possibility of \"serious problems by the end of this year\" if Japan does not have nuclear power. He added that Russia supplies 9% of Japan's natural gas, and losing that supply could spell trouble for the country as it would have to turn to alternative sources, which would lead to a spike in energy prices. Japan has repeatedly criticized Russian aggression in Ukraine and has slapped Moscow with economic sanctions. In response, Russia sanctioned over 300 Japanese lawmakers in July. Russia recently cut gas supplies to Europe via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to just a fifth of its capacity. Moscow has repeatedly denied it is weaponizing fossil fuel supplies over the Russia-Ukraine war. Tanaka said that Japan wants to secure energy supplies but also work toward reaching carbon neutrality by 2050, and striking that balance could prove increasingly challenging. Nuclear power has been touted as an important option for decarbonization.\n\"Japan is trying to secure the supply of energy, especially electricity, while trying to maintain the targets of carbon neutral by 2050 intact. So this is really (a) challenge for Japan to do many things,\" he said."},

But a new study suggests it may not be worth the time \u2014 at least in some places. The travel insurance comparison site InsureMyTrip compared rates for 950 hotels in 19 global cities on three popular booking websites as well as each hotel's site. According to the results published last week, Hotels.com had the best overall rates \u2014 but just barely. Hotels.com had the best rates in 620 instances, which was slightly higher than Expedia, which had the cheapest rates in 579 instances. Booking directly with a hotel was more expensive, but by only about $6 more on average, according to the study. \"There have been conflicting views on hotel rates, and people ... believe that booking through online travel platforms ensured a better rate than the hotel website,\" said Shalabh Arora, director of marketing at India's Four Seasons Hotel Bengaluru. \"However, it's not so at Four Seasons where rate parity is taken very seriously.\" He said the hotels' website has a pop-up function which compares rates offered by the hotel with those on other booking platforms. Finally, the website Booking.com had the cheapest rates in 72 instances \u2014 or about 7% of the time \u2014 according to the study. \"Not only was [Booking.com] rarely the most affordable, but it was also the most expensive option the majority of the time,\" according to the published results. The company's Managing Director for Asia Pacific Laura Houldsworth responded to the study by email, stating that the company aims \"to always be transparent with our customers\" and that \"our property partners are free to set their own prices on Booking.com.\" She added that \"our promise to price match also means that if a customer should ever find a lower price on another website, Booking.com will refund the difference.\" The report found average hotel rates on Hotels.com and Expedia were the same in seven of 19 cities, with overall averages varying by just 27 cents. \"Expedia and Hotels.com often had the same price, especially with the international hotels,\" said Sarah Webber, director of marketing for InsureMyTrip. Both brands are owned by Expedia Group, which also operates other travel booking websites, including Travelocity, Hotwire, Orbitz and CheapTickets. \"Hotels working with Expedia Group distribute their rates across all of our brands,\" said Anna Brown, a company public relations manager. \"The rate is similar across brands, however various offers ... approved by our hotel partners, sometimes create rate differences.\" Brown said rates can also vary through brands' app-only pricing, while Hotwire's \"Hot Rates\" mask hotels' names prior to purchase in exchange for deep discounts on last-minute bookings. Booking.com is part of Booking Holdings, which operates Priceline, Agoda and Kayak. Booking Holdings had the highest revenue among all online travel agencies from 2019 to 2021, according to the research company Statista. The InsureMyTrip report showed significant rate differences in certain cities. For instance, travelers could save as much as $88 per night in Honolulu, if they found the lowest price. In New York, the report found average hotel rates varied from $293 on Hotels.com to $367 on Booking.com. The study also found: But rate fluctuations were less pronounced outside of the United States. Posted rates varied less than $10 per night on average in Hong Kong, Bangkok, Macau, Kuala Lumpur and Istanbul, according to the research. InsureMyTrip's study represents a snapshot in time, with the research analyzing rates for a double room for two people booked for the night of Aug. 27, 2022, the firm said. All searches were conducted on the same day to avoid price fluctuations, since \"prices can change quickly and without warning,\" said Webber. However, the study did not consider whether rates were refundable or included taxes, said Webber. \"To keep the study as simple as possible, we took the price seen on the sites as the final cost,\" she said. \"So, it's definitely something to consider as not all hotels or booking sites include the same extras in the final price.\" Other factors, such as prepayment requirements and breakfast inclusions, can affect rates too, which further complicates the hotel price comparison process \u2014 for researchers and travelers alike."},

The defendants, Aimee Harris, 40, and Robert Kurlander, 58, conspired to steal items from Florida and transport them over state lines in September 2020, when Ashley's father was the Democratic nominee for the White House, according to a charging document. Kurlander as part of his plea in U.S. District Court in Manhattan agreed to cooperate with federal prosecutors, who are continuing to investigate how the diary was obtained by Project Veritas, the right-wing group that specializes in provocative videos and investigations designed to embarrass media outlets and other targets. Neither Biden was identified by name in the charging document released Thursday. But the details of the case match with what has been previously reported about an investigation by federal prosecutors in New York into the theft of Ashley's diary, which occurred weeks before the 2020 presidential election. The charging document says the father of the theft's victim was a \"then-former government official who was a candidate for national office.\" President Biden is a former U.S. senator and vice president. Ashley's diary, which she had left in a Delray Beach, Florida, home she was renting, and other items were ultimately sold for $40,000 to Project Veritas, which has offices in Mamaroneck, New York. Harris, who is a resident of Palm Beach, later temporarily stayed at the same residence where Ashley had lived, and discovered items that included a journal with \"highly personal entries\" and a digital storage card that the victim left behind, according to the charging document. The charging document says Project Veritas purchased the stolen property from Harris and the Jupiter resident Kurlander paid each of them $20,000. The charging document says that Harris asked Kurlander for his assistance in selling certain items of the victim's property. The document said that Harris and Kurlander in September 2020 attended a campaign fundraiser in Florida for a person, identified as Candidate-2, who was running against the victim's father. That fundraiser is understood to be one held for then-President Donald Trump. Four days later, a representative from Trump's campaign told Harris and Kurlander that the campaign was not interested in buying the stolen property, the charging document says. Kurlander then texted Harris, saying, \"[Candidate-2] campaign can't use it. They want it to go to the FBI. There is NO WAY [Candidate-2] can use this. It has to be done a different way.\" Manhattan U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in a statement Thursday, \"Harris and Kurlander stole personal property from an immediate family member of a candidate for national political office.\" \"They sold the property to an organization in New York for $40,000 and even returned to take more of the victim's property when asked to do so,\" Williams said. \"Harris and Kurlander sought to profit from their theft of another person's personal property, and they now stand convicted of a federal felony as a result,\" he said. Both defendants face a possible maximum sentence of five years in prison on the charge of conspiracy to commit interstate transportation of stolen property. They each agreed to forfeit $20,000 as part of their guilty pleas. FBI agents last November searched several locations that belonged to current and former members of Project Veritas as part of the probe of the Biden diary theft. Project Veritas CEO James O'Keefe, in a statement issued at that time, said that the organization had been approached by people offering it the Biden diary. But O'Keefe said the group decided not to publish the contents of the diary, and later turned it over to law enforcement when Ashley's lawyer refused to accept it. \"At the end of the day, we made the ethical decision that because, in part, we could not determine if the diary was real, if the diary in fact belonged to Ashley Biden, or if the contents of the diary occurred, we could not publish the diary and any part thereof,\" O'Keefe said at the time."},

Biden made one of the most influential policy decisions of his presidency Wednesday when he announced the cancellation of up to $10,000 in federal student loan debt for borrowers earning under $125,000 a year or $250,000 for married couples or heads of households. Pell Grant recipients can have up to $20,000 of debt canceled. The debt relief is capped at the amount of the borrower's outstanding debt, according to the Education Department. Some congressional Republicans immediately sought to undermine Biden's debt forgiveness plan. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., called it a \"radical agenda.\" \"Biden's debt transfer scam will make inflation even worse and does nothing to stop the runaway cost of college for most families,\" McCarthy posted on Twitter Wednesday. \"Americans cannot afford Democrats' radical agenda.\" Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene called the loan forgiveness policy \"unfair\" in an interview on conservative news network Newsmax TV. \"Taxpayers all over the country ... they shouldn't have to pay off the great, big student loan debt for some college student that piled up massive debt going to some Ivy League school,\" Greene said. The Georgia Republican added that Biden's debt forgiveness policy is a scheme to bring in Democratic votes during the November midterm elections. But public records show that Greene was the beneficiary of loan forgiveness in the early months of the pandemic. A Paycheck Protection Program loan of $182,200 given to Greene's company, Taylor Commercial Inc., in April 2020 was forgiven with accrued interest, according to records maintained by ProPublica. And wealthy Americans benefited from a nearly $2 trillion tax loophole after former President Donald Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act \u2014 passed by a Republican-controlled Congress \u2014 into law in 2017. Three-quarters of the benefit from the tax cuts outlined in the act would go to the top 1% of earners, per an analysis by the Tax Foundation. Biden's debt forgiveness policy is projected to cost the federal government around $244 billion, according to higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. Forgiveness for Pell Grant recipients will cost an additional $120 billion. The debt forgiveness plan also extends the pause on student loan debt repayments to Dec. 31, 2022. Over 40 million Americans owe $1.7 trillion in student loan debt."},

The FBI had probable cause to believe that records containing classified national defense information would be found at the Palm Beach, Florida, residence, according to an agent who wrote the 32-page affidavit. \"There is also probable cause to believe that evidence of obstruction will be found\" at Trump's home, read an unredacted portion of the affidavit. A federal judge had ordered the key document's release over the objections of the DOJ, which argued it contains highly sensitive facts about the ongoing criminal investigation into Trump. U.S. Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart accepted the DOJ's proposed redactions to the affidavit one day before it was made public. Click here or scroll down to read the heavily redacted affidavit. \"The government is conducting a criminal investigation concerning the improper removal and storage of classified information in unauthorized spaces, as well as the unlawful concealment and removal of government records,\" the FBI agent, whose name was blacked out, wrote in the affidavit's first line. The agent then wrote that the probe began because of a referral from the National Archives and Records Administration in February, after NARA received 15 boxes of records from Trump's residence in Florida. By law, presidential records must be turned over to the National Archives when a president departs office. The FBI found that in those boxes were documents that bore classification markings, and included records relating to national defense information, which had been stored at Mar-a-Lago in an unsecured location. The 15 boxes included 184 specific documents marked classified, 67 of which were marked \"confidential,\" 92 marked \"secret\" and 25 documents marked \"top secret,\" according to the affidavit. \"Based upon this investigation, I do not believe that any spaces within the PREMISES have been authorized for the storage of classified information at least since the end of FPOTUS 's Presidential Administration on January 20, 2021,\" the agent wrote in the affidavit. Of the 32 pages of the affidavit, 21 pages are almost totally or significantly blacked out. The search warrant itself was revealed voluntarily by the DOJ less than a week after the Aug. 8 raid. The warrant indicated that FBI agents were looking for materials showing violations of laws against obstruction of justice and the removal of official records, as well as the U.S. Espionage Act. The FBI took at least 20 boxes of items in the August raid, including numerous sets of highly classified documents, according to a property receipt that was also made public by the DOJ. In a social media post after the redacted affidavit was released, Trump accused the FBI and DOJ of \"public relations subterfuge\" by the fact that the word \"Nuclear\" did not appear in the document \u2014 though he also noted that it was \"heavily redacted!!!\" The affidavit did not detail the specific content of documents it expected to find. Trump also lashed out at Reinhart, arguing that he should have recused himself from this matter because he had previously removed himself from another case involving the former president. The reason for that recusal was not clear, news outlets reported, but Trump claimed it was \"based on his animosity and hatred of your favorite President, me.\" The government argued last week against releasing the affidavit, even in a redacted form. \"The redactions necessary to mitigate harms to the integrity of the investigation would be so extensive as to render the remaining unsealed text devoid of meaningful content,\" read a court filing from Jay Bratt, head of the counterintelligence and export control section of the DOJ's National Security Division. Bratt also argued that the affidavit \"would serve as a roadmap to the government's ongoing investigation\" if disclosed. Reinhart disagreed, and ordered the government to propose redactions to U.S. District Court in West Palm Beach, Florida, by Thursday. The judge accepted the DOJ's redactions later that day. The government said last week that the Mar-a-Lago raid is part of a probe that \"implicates national security\" and is still in its \"early stages.\" Trump, who first revealed the FBI's search of his Florida residence, has cast himself as the victim of a political attack by the Biden administration that was carried out against the presumptive Republican front-runner in the 2024 presidential race. The former president on Monday sued the government, asking a federal judge to block the DOJ from poring over the documents seized from Mar-a-Lago until a court-appointed third party reviews them. \"The political Hacks and Thugs had no right under the Presidential Records Act to storm Mar-a-Lago and steal everything in sight, including Passports and privileged documents,\" Trump said in a social media post earlier Friday morning.

The order Thursday came hours after the Department of Justice submitted a proposal in U.S District Court for the Southern District of Florida detailing how it wanted portions of that affidavit kept secret if the document were to be made public. That proposal itself is sealed, making it impossible to know what the DOJ wants to be kept hidden in the search warrant affidavit. But Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart in his order wrote that he agreed the DOJ \"has met its burden\" in showing there was a compelling reason to keep portions of the affidavit out of the public eye. Reinhart said the redactions were warranted because disclosure would reveal the identities of law enforcement agents, witnesses, and uncharged parties, as well as \"the investigation's strategy\" and direction, and \"grand jury information.\" FBI agents, carrying the warrant issued on the basis of the affidavit, on Aug. 8 raided Trump's residence at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach. They seized a dozen or so boxes of documents as part of a criminal investigation of the removal of presidential records from the White House when he left office in January 2021. Many of those documents were highly classified. The DOJ probe is eyeing possible obstruction of justice and violations of the U.S. espionage act and the law prohibiting the removal of official records. By law, presidential records must be given to the National Archives and Records Administration when a president leaves office. A group of media organizations had asked Reinhart to unseal the entire affidavit. That document, like other such affidavits submitted with search warrant applications, would detail why authorities believed there was probable cause that a crime had been committed. The affidavit also would describe what evidence authorities believed might be at the target location. But Reinhart, in his order Thursday, wrote, \"I further find that the Government has met its burden of showing that its proposed redactions are narrowly tailored to serve the Government's legitimate interest in the integrity of the ongoing investigation and are the least onerous alternative to sealing the entire Affidavit.\""},

The former TV personality's vocal support for the energy business follows years of industry donations to his nonprofit and then his campaign, according to financial records reviewed by CNBC. Oz also has a personal stake in oil and gas through investments in two major energy companies, according to his financial disclosures. Pennsylvania's next senator will be a key vote for the energy industry, as it has a major presence in the Keystone State. Pennsylvania is the nation's second-largest natural gas producer after Texas and the third-largest coal producer, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Oz backed the energy industry this year as Americans felt the strain from spiking gas prices. In a recent interview, he ripped President Joe Biden after he called on companies that run gas stations to bring down prices at the pump. \"Now, they're blaming the energy companies for the gas prices. And I'm thinking, like most Americans, what are you talking about? I mean, you did things that make it, make it impossible for these companies to exist,\" Oz said in a July interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity. He called Biden's comments \"class warfare.\" As Oz champions oil and gas in his bid to represent Pennsylvania in the Senate, both his campaign and personal coffers have benefited from the industry and its executives. Oz, a veteran physician and television host, is running against Democrat John Fetterman for a Senate seat being vacated by Republican Sen. Pat Toomey. Oz is trailing Fetterman by just under 8 percentage points in an average of recent polls, according to RealClearPolitics. Fetterman's campaign has raised over $25 million, while Oz and his team have brought in just over $18 million, according to data from the nonpartisan OpenSecrets. Oz and his wife, Lisa, have a financial stake in the industry he has championed, as they own shares of oil and gas giants ConocoPhillips and Pioneer Natural Resources, according to their financial disclosure report. The filing notes they own shares of ConocoPhillips valued between $15,001 and $50,000 and Pioneer stock valued between $1,001 and $15,000. Oz's connections to the industry formed before he pursued politics. His nonprofit HealthCorps, which promotes itself as a group aiming to help teens with their health and wellness, has seen at least $210,000 in contributions from gas and oil producer Continental Resources since 2016, according to the group's annual financial reports. Continental's support has continued into Oz's Senate bid: The company's founder and chair, Harold Hamm, endorsed Oz for Senate in an April campaign video. The backing from energy industry leaders has led to contributions to Oz's campaign. Hamm is among a group of over a dozen oil and gas industry leaders who have combined to contribute over $200,000 to Oz's campaign since he announced his run for Senate late last year, according to a CNBC review of Federal Election Commission filings. Others with ties to the oil and gas business who have donated at least $2,900 to Oz's campaign include Jimmy Haslam, an owner of the Cleveland Browns and chair of Pilot Company, a business that owns fueling stations across the country. His father and Pilot founder, James Haslam II, also donated to the Oz campaign. Other top energy donors in recent months include Brad Cox, the chair of oil producer Cox Operating, and Janet Cafaro, the president of Silcor Oilfield Services, FEC records show. Jimmy Haslam and his wife, Susan \"Dee\" Haslam, combined to give $50,000 to the pro-Oz super PAC American Leadership Action. Jimmy and Dee Haslam told CNBC in a statement that they have \"tremendous respect for the long, successful career Dr. Oz has had in the private sector and appreciate that he now wants to serve his country by bringing his expertise and experience to the United States Senate.\" The Haslam family, as of 2015, had a net worth of $6 billion, according to Forbes. Representatives for Cox and Cafaro did not return requests for comment. Hamm told CNBC in a statement that he considers Oz a \"friend.\" He said the two have known each other for almost a decade, with the goal of bringing HealthCorps' services into Oklahoma schools. Hamm explained that he believes Oz will be a key advocate for the energy sector, which has enriched the oil billionaire. He and his family have a net worth of at least $21 billion, according to Forbes. \"Dr. Oz will champion American energy in the U.S. Senate much like he's championed health his entire career,\" Hamm said. The nonprofit's annual reports from 2016 through 2020 give a range of how much donors contributed to HealthCorps. Continental Resources regularly ranked among the Oz group's top backers. The company is often listed as donating between $50,000 and $99,999 during those years. A HealthCorps filing says it received a range of $10,000 to just under $25,000 from Continental in 2018. In its earlier filings before 2016, HealthCorps lists Continental as either a \"national\" or a \"community\" sponsor. The group's website notes that its national sponsors contribute $1 million and its community donors write checks for $250,000. The disclosures pre-2016 do not say or show a range of how much the company gave those years. Oz's support from the massive energy industry coincides with an apparent shift in his opinion on fracking, which allows companies to drill deep into the earth for oil and gas resources. Critics say that fracking hurts the environment by harming water supplies and polluting the air. Before Oz ran for Senate, he repeatedly wrote columns that took aim at fracking, noting its potential threat to public health, Vice reports. \"And in Pennsylvania, there are multiple reports of air and water contamination, possibly from hydraulic fracturing sites, causing folks breathing problems, rashes, headaches, nosebleeds, numbness, nausea and vomiting,\" Oz said in a 2014 column critical of fracking. Brittany Yanick, a spokeswoman for the Oz campaign, said the candidate has not changed his view on fracking and is a strong supporter of the drilling method. She also took aim at Fetterman's position on the issue. \"As a scientist, Dr. Oz understands that, like with COVID, the Biden administration is ignoring the science and the benefits of natural gas in order to satisfy the radical Left, the same liberal Democrats that are supporting radical environmental measures and funding John Fetterman's campaign,\" Yanick said in an emailed statement. \"John Fetterman has called fracking a 'stain' on Pennsylvania, he's called for a moratorium on fracking, and he would be a rubber stamp for the failing Biden Agenda.\" Fetterman has a mixed history with where he stands on fracking. Inside Climate News reported that Fetterman dropped his support for a fracking moratorium after his failed 2016 primary run for Senate. His position evolved after the state moved toward stricter regulations on fracking. Emilia Rowland, a spokeswoman for Fetterman's campaign, told CNBC that \"John does not support a ban on fracking in Pennsylvania and that includes a moratorium on new fracking sites.\" She said he hasn't taken any campaign money from the fossil fuel industry. \"John believes fully heartedly that we have to preserve the union way of life for the thousands of workers currently employed by the natural gas industry in Pennsylvania and the communities where they live. We can't just abandon these people, and tell them to go learn how to code,\" Rowland said in a statement. \"It's a total false choice that we have to choose between jobs and a clean environment. That's just not true. We can have both.\" Still, Oz appears more vocal than Fetterman in publicly supporting the oil and gas industry. In a recent op-ed, he said it's \"gross, and deeply unpatriotic\" for oil companies to charge high gas prices while their businesses are making massive profits. Fetterman namechecked Chevron, Exxon and Shell in the op-ed. Oz has rubbed elbows with industry officials during his campaign. He was invited to a June \"energy industry meet and greet\" by longtime lobbyist Missy Edwards. The invite says the meeting was set to take place at Edwards' offices in Washington. Her current clients include Southern Company and General Motors, OpenSecrets says. A spokeswoman for General Motors said she was \"not sure if GM had a representative in attendance.\" Edwards and a representative for Southern Company did not return requests for comment."},

Mark Kelly in November's election, according to people familiar with the matter. Masters has received urgent private calls in recent weeks from GOP leaders like Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., the head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, these people explained. The NRSC is the official campaign arm for the Senate GOP, and has spent over $6 million taking on Masters' rival Kelly, according to data from the nonpartisan OpenSecrets. Kelly's seat has long been considered a potential pickup opportunity for Republicans, as forecaster Cook Political Report labels the race a toss-up. Recent polling, however, suggests that Masters is falling behind. A Fox News poll taken in August shows Kelly leading Masters by 8 points, while an Arizona Republican pollster told NBC News that his own surveys showed Masters trailing Kelly by 10 points. Longtime GOP megadonors, who want to help Masters overtake Kelly but have not heard from him since he won the party's primary, have inundated the Republican candidate with calls, these people explained. A person familiar with one of the recent calls to Masters said a veteran GOP financier \"read him the riot act\" and told him, in part, that he must start raising money from more wealthy Republican donors and stop relying on billionaire tech executive Peter Thiel, his longtime colleague and friend, to help him like he did in the primary. These people declined to be named in order to speak freely about private conversations. Shortly after publication of this story, Katie Miller, a spokeswoman for the Masters campaign, denied that the candidate ever heard from a GOP megadonor who \"read him the riot act.\" Miller told CNBC in an email: \"It didn't happen.\" Kelly has massively outraised Masters, who won a Republican primary in Arizona this month. The incumbent's campaign has amassed more than $54 million during the 2022 election cycle, compared with just over $4 million for Masters' campaign, according to the latest Federal Election Commission data. Thiel contributed $15 million during the primary to a pro-Masters super PAC, Saving Arizona, and he donated $1.5 million to the committee as recently as July. Masters was the chief operating officer at Thiel Capital, an investment firm founded by Thiel. The calls to Masters come as even some Republican leaders seem to be questioning their Senate candidates. When asked about his predictions for the midterms, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said\"candidate quality\" has a lot to do with winning Senate elections. He added that he believes there will be an \"extremely close Senate\" after November's elections. The Senate is currently split 50-50 between Democrats and Republicans. In a statement to CNBC, NRSC spokesman Chris Hartline did not deny that Scott called Masters to urge him to improve his fundraising operation. \"Mark Kelly votes with Joe Biden almost 100% of the time. While he claims to be a moderate, he's supported reckless Washington spending and done nothing to address the border crisis that's raging in Arizona. The NRSC will continue to remind Arizona voters of Mark Kelly's radical agenda and Blake Masters' plans to fight for Arizona families,\" Hartline said in response to questions about Scott's contact with Masters. Data from ad tracker AdImpact shows that the NRSC has booked just over $3.8 million in ads in Arizona for September, but nothing yet for October or November. The ad tracker also shows that Masters' campaign has not yet booked airtime for the fall while Kelly's team has reserved over $10 million in ad space from September through November. AdImpact says it has not yet seen data showing the Thiel-backed Saving Arizona reserve airtime for the fall. The last spending it saw from the super PAC was on Aug. 2, the day of the Arizona Senate Republican primary. The super PAC spent over $10 million during the primary, including almost $8.5 million backing Masters, according to OpenSecrets. Masters and his campaign did not return requests for comment. A spokesman for Saving Arizona did not return requests for comment. Thiel and his spokesman did not return requests for comment, including about whether the billionaire GOP donor plans to help Masters further. The candidates and outside groups from both sides of the aisle have combined to spend over $90 million in the general election Senate race in Arizona. Yet Democratic organizations appear to be outspending their Republican rivals in the Grand Canyon State on ads in the coming months. AdImpact's data shows Democratic outside groups are reserving nearly $28 million worth of ad time in Arizona over the next three months. Republican committees have so far spent just over $16 million on ad buys within the same time span trying to help Masters overtake Kelly, according to the data."},

The funds sent back to the SBA were obtained via the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program using both fabricated information and stolen identities. The suspects used Green Dot Bank, a fintech institution, to hold and move the fraudulent funds. More than 15,000 accounts were used in the conspiracy, by individuals in the U.S. as well as domestic and transnational organized crime rings, the agency said. Investigations are ongoing and further information about suspects was not immediately released. The investigation was initiated by the Secret Service field office in Orlando, Florida, and Green Dot bank worked with the agency to identify the fraudulent accounts. \"Fraudsters in general are always looking for ways and techniques to better do their crimes and modern conveniences are just one of those things they use. So currently, cryptocurrency is a big thing, fintechs, third-party payment systems. But there's not an institution, even our traditional financial institutions, that weren't targeted during the pandemic,\" Roy Dotson, lead investigator for the Secret Service, told CNBC in an interview. Initial investigations indicated the majority of the fraudulent accounts at Green Dot were established with synthetic and stolen identities, and involved using \"willing and unwilling money mules,\" Dotson said. The Secret Service and SBA Office of Inspector General put out advisories to 30,000 financial institutions in early 2020 to lay out fraud indicators and guide the banks to partner with federal agencies to recover fraudulent funds, Dotson said. He added these investigations will likely last years due to their size and scope. Green Dot said it has partnered with federal agencies including the Secret Service to identify fraud in the industry. \"Account protection and fraud prevention are top priorities for us, and we work around the clock and invest heavily to identify, block and address fraudulent activity. We're committed to protecting customers, and also to serving as [a] proactive ally to government agencies and industry peers as we work together to prevent fraud,\" Green Dot spokeswoman Alison Lubert said in a statement. OIG Inspector General Hannibal Ware said the partnership with the Secret Service has to date resulted in more than 400 indictments and nearly 300 convictions related to pandemic fraud. The U.S. government allocated more than $1 trillion to Main Street under both the Paycheck Protection Program and EIDL program. The PPP allowed small businesses to borrow loans that may be forgiven if the borrower used the majority of the capital on payroll, while the Covid-19 EIDL program allowed borrowers to access loans based on temporary losses of revenue due to the pandemic. An advance grant was also available under the EIDL. Reviews of the two programs by the SBA's Office of Inspector General warned that criminals would potentially exploit the system due to the fast-moving nature of the rollout and demand for aid. CNBC investigations revealed, in some cases, how easy it was for criminals to obtain fraudulent aid via stolen identities. The SBA OIG said it has identified $87 billion of potentially fraudulent EIDL loans. Over the past two years, the Secret Service said it has seized over $1.4 billion in fraudulently obtained funds and assisted in returning some $2.3 billion to state unemployment insurance programs. Nearly 4,000 pandemic-related fraud investigations and inquiries have been initiated by the Secret Service. More than 150 field offices and 40 cyber task forces are involved. \"This is not going to be a quick fix. As we talked about today, 15,325 accounts at one financial institution \u2014 this is one case, so you can just think of the potential number of suspects and how many investigations that could come out of those. And with all of our federal, state and local partners working this and having the same mission. It's going to be a long process,\" Dotson said at a news conference announcing the returned funds."},

A few states quickly followed through. Idaho sold $300,000 of bonds in a Russian oil company in early March. A day before the invasion, the Kentucky Teachers Retirement System sold its shares in the Russian bank Sberbank. But those examples are outliers. Six months into a war that has killed thousands of Ukrainians and displaced over 12 million more, most of the pledges to drop Russian investments \u2014 some made with great fanfare during news conferences \u2014 have gone unfulfilled, according to an Associated Press review, state retirement administrators and firms that invest state funds. Swift global reaction has cut off much of Russia's economy from the rest of the world. That has made it nearly impossible for divestment by state pension funds, university endowments and other public-sector holdings \u2014 as well as private investments such as those in 401(k) accounts. \"These pension funds want to get out, but it's just not realistic to sell everything in the current environment,\" said Keith Brainard, research director at the National Association of State Retirement Administrators. Benjamin Smith, a spokesperson for the Rhode Island treasury, said the factors that make it hard to divest also show that a worldwide effort to isolate Russian President Vladimir Putin is working. \"This is good news because it means that pressure from investors across the world, including Rhode Island, is succeeding in exacting a toll on the Russian economy, making it more difficult for Putin to fund his military operation, state-owned companies, and corrupt network of oligarchs,\" he said in an email, noting that Rhode Island's pension plan exposure in Russia never exceeded 0.3% of its assets. Any pre-war investments in Russia are now worthless, or nearly so. That's raising questions from some officials and fund managers about whether divesting is even necessary. In Hawaii, one of a handful of states where top administration officials did not pledge to divest, Gov. David Ige said at a May 5 news conference that the state's employee pension system had \"very little to almost nothing\" invested in Russia. \"The few remaining investments are quite small, and so I didn't feel compelled to just make a statement for political reasons that we would be divesting,\" he said. Before Russia's invasion in late February, many government-controlled investments had only small holdings \u2014 a fraction of 1% in every reported case \u2014 in Russian investments. But even that could amount to millions of dollars. The largest U.S. public-sector retirement fund, California's CalPERS, said just 17 cents of every $100 of its portfolio was in Russian investments as the war broke out. Even so, that translated into $765 million worth of stocks, real estate and private equity. By the end of June, the value had shrunk to $194 million. The entire loss was because the holdings dropped in value; none had been sold. There is no way to know how much state government entities in the U.S. have invested in Russia or companies based there, but collectively they were worth billions of dollars before the war. Much of the money was invested in Russian government bonds, oil and coal companies as part of emerging-markets index funds. Quick to condemn the invasion, state officials said they could put pressure on Putin by dumping their Russian investments. \"Our moral imperative before these atrocities demand that you act to address Russia's aggressions and immediately restrict Russian access to California's capital and investments,\" California Gov. Gavin Newsom wrote in a letter on Feb. 28 to the boards overseeing the massive pension funds that serve teachers, state and local government workers and university employees. Across the country, governors and other top officials made similar statements. Just after the invasion began, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul signed an executive order calling for divestment \"to the extent possible,\" while Arizona's Board of Regents voted to exit any Russian investments. The treasurers for 36 states plus the District of Columbia and U.S. Virgin Islands signed a joint letter in March advocating divestment of publicly controlled funds from Russia. They noted a financial reason for doing so: \"The current crisis also constitutes a substantial risk for states' investments and our economic security.\" A major chunk of the government holdings in Russia is in the form of index funds that investors use to mimic overall stock market performance. Russian stocks were commonly part of funds specializing in emerging markets. MCSI and other firms that decide which stocks should be in the funds quickly dropped Russian securities. But the companies that sell investment products based on those indexes were left in the lurch, still leaving pieces of Russian stocks in their investors' portfolios. As part of the sanctions, stock markets in the U.S. and elsewhere stopped the trading of Russian stocks. And the Moscow Stock Exchange was closed for nearly a month, reopening with tight controls that keep U.S. investors from selling. The assets sank in value amid the invasion, though the precise value isn't always clear. Maryland said that as of the beginning of February, $197 million of its state retirement and pension system funds were invested in Russian assets. A month later, the state estimated the value had plunged and amounted to just $32 million. The state has been unable to unload its investments. For the handful of states in which top officials have not endorsed divestment, eroding values like that are the main reason. Shortly after the invasion, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said the number of state investments in Russia was \"minuscule\" and noted that the value was about to \"shrink to almost nothing as the Russian economy is being virtually shut off from the world.\" In Florida, Lamar Taylor, the interim executive director of the agency that oversees investments of pension funds, said during a cabinet meeting that some investment managers might seek to unload Russian assets as soon as they're able, while others could hold on in case they're worth more later. At the meeting, Gov. Ron DeSantis said the State Board of Administration has a legal responsibility to try to make money for the retirement system. \"That would violate your fiduciary duty, if you liquidated at massive losses for political reasons rather than for the best interests of the beneficiaries,\" he said. But DeSantis said there was a way to make it easier: Lawmakers passing a bill banning investment in Russia. \"If the Legislature could speak clearly, that would be something we'd welcome here, just to make sure we're not furthering investments in parts of the world that are not reflective of our interests or values,\" he said. Hank Kim, executive director of the National Conference on Public Employee Retirement Systems, said he has told member pension funds that taking steps to divest is important even if it can't be completed right away. \"The public has a right to know that it was debated in a serious manner,\" he said."},

The previously unreported photo, released by the War College to Reuters after a request under the Freedom of Information Act, showed Mastriano in a 2013-14 portrait for the Department of Military Strategy, Plans, and Operations, where he worked. Faculty at the time had been given the option of dressing as a historical figure, people familiar with the photo said. At least 15 of the 21 faculty in the photo opted to appear in regular attire. Although one man wears a trench coat and sunglasses and another carries an aviator's helmet, Mastriano is the only one wearing a Confederate uniform. Mastriano did not immediately respond to requests for comment made by email and phone. A Reuters reporter attended a Mastriano event on Wednesday to seek comment, but the candidate did not make himself available for questions. Displays of Confederate symbols can be seen as insensitive to those who view them as painful reminders of racial oppression and the Civil War that saw 11 rebelling Confederate states fight to keep Black people enslaved. The U.S. military issued a de facto ban on displaying the Confederate flag and has sought to remove segregationist symbols from bases and academic institutions following the murder in May 2020 of George Floyd, a Black man whose killing by a white police officer in Minneapolis triggered protests worldwide. After Reuters made its formal request for the photo, it was removed from the War College wall where it had hung alongside other annual portraits of faculty groups. The Army War College (AWC), a premier military higher education institution in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, told Reuters a team had reviewed all art, text, and other images displayed at Carlisle Barracks in 2020, but missed the faculty photo. \"The faculty photo did not get the team's attention; the photo has since been removed because it does not meet AWC values,\" the college said in a statement. Asked about the War College photo, a spokesperson at U.S. Army headquarters said: \"The Army supports commanders who remove symbols or images that do not comport with Army values.\" Confederate symbols and dress have been embraced by white supremacists in the United States, and monuments and flags honoring the Confederacy have been removed from many public areas in recent years. Pennsylvania plays an outsized role in U.S. politics as a so-called swing state in presidential elections, and Republican Mastriano, who has embraced Trump's stolen election lies, is trailing his Democratic opponent in the governor's race ahead of the November ballot. It is unclear how the photo might be viewed in Pennsylvania, which played a critical role in the Civil War. More than 33,000 soldiers from Pennsylvania died fighting for the Union, and the state was the site of the Battle of Gettysburg, the conflict's bloodiest battle, which ended with a Union victory and inspired President Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. Mastriano's district, Pennsylvania's 33rd, includes Gettysburg. Many Americans continue to participate in Civil War battle re-enactments, wearing uniforms from both sides in an effort to preserve U.S. history."},

The judge scheduled a Thursday hearing to discuss the matter further. A special master is often a former judge. Cannon also directed the Justice Department to file under seal with her more detailed descriptions of the material taken from Trump's property.

The Justice Department argued in a court filing that Trump lacks the legal standing to appoint a special master. Appointing that watchdog could harm national security, the agency warned. The department also said it has evidence that government records likely were concealed and removed from a storage room at Trump's home at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, \"and that efforts were likely taken to obstruct the government's investigation.\" Trump had sued to block the Justice Department from further investigating any materials taken in the raid until a court-appointed special master is able to analyze them. That step is typically taken when there is a chance that some evidence should be withheld from prosecutors because of various legal privileges. \"As an initial matter, the former President lacks standing to seek judicial relief or oversight as to Presidential records because those records do not belong to him,\" the DOJ wrote to Judge Aileen Cannon in U.S. District Court in southern Florida. Cannon, who was appointed by Trump, has set a hearing for Thursday at 1 p.m. ET in a West Palm Beach courthouse. Trump's legal team has until Wednesday night to reply to the DOJ's latest submission. The DOJ is conducting a criminal investigation of the removal of White House documents and their shipment to Trump's residence at Mar-a-Lago when he left office. By law, presidential records must be turned over to the National Archives and Records Administration when a president departs office. The National Archives and Records Administration retrieved 15 boxes of records from Mar-a-Lago in January. The next month, NARA sent a referral to the DOJ that the records contained \"highly classified documents intermingled with other records,\" according to the affidavit used to obtain the warrant for the Aug. 8 search of Trump's home. The DOJ said in Tuesday night's filing that the FBI had \"uncovered multiple sources of evidence indicating ... that classified documents remained\" at Mar-a-Lago. \"The government also developed evidence that government records were likely concealed and removed from the Storage Room and that efforts were likely taken to obstruct the government's investigation,\" the DOJ wrote. That evidence contradicted a sworn certification letter on June 3 from the custodian of Trump's records, claiming that \"any and all\" documents responsive to a grand jury subpoena had been handed over, the DOJ wrote. The August search \"cast serious doubt on the claim in the certification ... that there had been 'a diligent search' for records responsive to the grand jury subpoena,\" according to the DOJ's filing. Of the evidence taken in that raid, \"over one hundred unique documents with classification markings \u2014 that is, more than twice the amount produced on June 3, 2022, in response to the grand jury subpoena \u2014 were seized,\" the DOJ wrote. \"That the FBI, in a matter of hours, recovered twice as many documents with classification markings as the 'diligent search' that the former President's counsel and other representatives had weeks to perform calls into serious question the representations made in the June 3 certification and casts doubt on the extent of cooperation in this matter,\" the DOJ wrote. The prosecutors also argued against the appointment of a special master, saying it is \"unnecessary\" and that doing so \"would significantly harm important governmental interests, including national security interests.\" That harm could include impeding the intelligence community's \"ongoing review of the national security risk\" that may have been caused by \"improper storage of these highly sensitive materials,\" the DOJ argued. The prosecutors concluded that Cannon should reject Trump's requests \"and decline to require the return of seized items, enjoin further review of seized materials, or appoint a special master.\" Tuesday's filing came one day after the DOJ told Cannon that its review of the seized materials was complete. The DOJ told the court on Monday that a law enforcement team had identified a \"limited set\" of materials that may be protected by attorney-client privilege. That privilege often refers to the legal doctrine that protects the confidentiality of communications between an attorney and their client. The so-called privilege review team \u2014 which is separate from the investigation that led the FBI to search Trump's residence earlier this month \u2014 is following a process to \"address potential privilege disputes, if any,\" the DOJ wrote. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence \"is also leading an intelligence community assessment of the potential risk to national security that would result from the disclosure of these materials,\" according to the filing. Before the DOJ posted its late-night response, a group of former government officials asked the judge to let them file a brief as \"amici curiae\" \u2014 Latin for \"friends of the court\" \u2014 arguing against Trump's requests. The group included six former federal prosecutors who served in Republican administrations, as well as former New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, who governed as a Republican but backed President Joe Biden over Trump in 2020."},

Charlie Crist announced Wednesday he will resign from Congress as he campaigns to unseat Florida's Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in November. The move will shrink Democrats' already-slim majority in the House, potentially complicating efforts to pass more legislation before the midterm elections when Republicans are currently favored to take control. Serving in Congress \"has been an honor and a privilege,\" Crist said in a statement, which did not mention his campaign for governor. \"From the bottom of my heart, thank you for trusting me as your Representative in Washington.\" Crist will step down by the close of business Wednesday, he said in the statement. Congressional staff for Crist's district will provide casework and constituent services until the next representatives are sworn in in January, the statement said. Florida's 13th Congressional District, where Crist has served since 2017, is considered a likely pickup for Republicans this November, according to the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. The district's political makeup shifted toward the GOP after a new congressional map, proposed by DeSantis, re-shaped the area. Crist handily won the Democratic nomination for Florida's gubernatorial race. But polls show him trailing DeSantis, a dominant figure in the GOP who is widely rumored to be gearing up for a 2024 presidential run. DeSantis has also far outraised Crist: The powerful Republican incumbent governor's campaign has raised more than $165 million since 2019, OpenSecrets reported earlier this month. DeSantis' stature in the party is exceeded perhaps only by former President Donald Trump, who has regularly teased the possibility of launching another White House bid. Crist's move mirrors DeSantis' decision in 2018 to resign from Congress as he campaigned for governor in a hotly contested race against Democrat Andrew Gillum. DeSantis at the time said that he did not want to be criticized for taking a U.S. representative's paycheck while missing votes."},

Those investments come just as Emirates posted a $1.1 billion loss for the year ended March 31. \"While others respond to industry pressures with cost cuts, Emirates is flying against the grain and investing to deliver ever better experiences to our customers,\" said the president of Emirates airline, Tim Clark. Emirates is not the only airline pulling out all the stops to ride the tailwinds of \"revenge travel\" \u2014 the idea that people are making up for time \"lost\" during the pandemic to travel again. Earlier this year, Finnair launched a new line of premium economy cabins, featuring seats that provide around 50% more space than their economy seats. Air France, likewise, announced new long-haul business seats in May, complete with sliding dividers for passengers who want their own private space.\nEmirates told CNBC that it has seen \"a lot of interest\" in these luxury upgrades, though it said it does not have the full numbers yet. The upgrades come on the heels of an industry report predicting that business travel spending will return to pre-pandemic levels in 2026 rather than 2024, as previously forecast. Though spending by business travelers has been on the upswing, the Global Business Travel Association (GBTA) annual report stated that the 2021 figure was still less than half of the over $1.4 trillion that was generated by in business travel in 2019. One travel analytics company, however, noted a shift in demand toward premium seats. \"During the pandemic, we saw that the numbers of people travelling by air collapsed. However, the proportion of travelers flying in premium cabins increased significantly,\" Olivier Ponti of ForwardKeys told CNBC in an email.\nPonti said that before the pandemic, the split between premium and economy seats was a ratio of 13:87, compared with 17:83 in 2022.\n\"While there's no guarantee that the shift towards premium seats will be maintained as air travel recovers, one can understand why the airlines would want to invest in keeping hold of premium passengers, who, this year have typically spent 575% more on a seat than those flying economy.\" Others are skeptical, however. Edward Russell, an editor at Skift, a travel industry news site, told CNBC it's unclear how much of an effect \"small\" product changes will have on sales. \"Most travelers either fly the airline, or alliance, where they have loyalty, or opt for the cheapest fare.

Employees are turning to gadgets to outsmart monitoring software. One such tool is a mouse mover, or mouse jiggler, that's supposed to keep your screen on. I decided to give one a try to see if it works. I learned about mouse jigglers on TikTok. A mouse mover is a device that claims to be undetectable by your computer. As the name indicates, the device simulates mouse movement, preventing your computer from going into sleep mode. So-called \"tattleware,\" or surveillance software is being installed on company-issued devices to track employee screen time, keyboard usage, and clicks. The mouse jiggler may not help with keyboard usage or clicks, but it should address screen time monitoring by keeping your computer's display on. Here's how a mouse jiggler works. I ordered a $30 Vaydeer Mouse Jiggler off Amazon and tested it out for a day. It took less than a minute to set up. You simply plug the power cord into the USB port on your computer, or attach it to the power brick and plug it into the wall. Use the wall for power if you're paranoid. You probably don't want to plug any type of device that helps you avoid work directly into a work-owned computer, especially since USB ports open up a whole host of security concerns, too. There's an orange power button on the left side that you can press to turn it on and off. A turntable moves when it's on. That's where you place the mouse's sensor. Once your mouse is in the right position, you'll begin to see the cursor on your screen move very slowly, keeping your monitor from going to sleep. That's pretty much all there is to it. Once your mouse is on the jiggler you can get up, make lunch, do whatever you need, and your computer won't go to sleep. It won't make you more productive, of course, but it may trick some surveillance software into thinking you're still working, at least if that software is checking to see if your computer is active. We shouldn't need these gadgets in the first place, though. I was surprised to learn employer surveillance is more common than I thought. A recent examination by the New York Times found that 80% of the 10 largest private U.S. employers track the productivity metrics of individual workers. And secretly monitoring employees makes them more likely to the very break rules these systems are trying to deter, according to a recent study by Harvard Business Review. Transparency is key to keeping worker morale up. Instead of monitoring employees, explaining the scope and purpose of monitoring can boost employees' acceptance of the practice by about 70%, according to a recent study by Gartner, a management consultant company."},

Cannon ordered the government to publicly respond to Trump by Tuesday.

The ODNI \"is also leading an intelligence community assessment of the potential risk to national security that would result from the disclosure of these materials,\" he wrote. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre declined to answer reporters' specific questions about the DOJ probe later Monday, stressing that the agency is conducting its investigation independently and \"we have not been involved.\" She noted, however, neither President Joe Biden nor anyone else at the White House has been briefed on the matter, but declined to comment on any classified materials prepared for the president. Trump's civil lawsuit is being overseen by a different judge than the one who approved the search warrant for Mar-a-Lago.

The National Archives and Records Administration retrieved 15 boxes of records from Mar-a-Lago in January. The next month, NARA sent a referral to the DOJ that the records contained \"highly classified documents intermingled with other records,\" according to the affidavit. By law, presidential records must be turned over to the National Archives when a president departs office. The FBI launched a criminal investigation and found that the 15 boxes included 184 specific documents marked classified, 67 of which were marked \"confidential,\" 92 marked \"secret\" and 25 marked \"top secret,\" according to the affidavit. The search warrant was revealed days after the FBI entered Mar-a-Lago in August. It indicated that FBI agents were looking for materials showing violations of laws against obstruction of justice and the removal of official records, as well as the U.S. Espionage Act. The FBI took at least 20 boxes of items in the August raid, including numerous sets of highly classified documents, according to a property receipt that was also made public by the DOJ."},

These days? Not so much. The average new-car discount offered by manufacturers is down an estimated 47.1% from a year ago to $969, according to a recent forecast from J.D. Power and LMC Automotive. August marked the fourth consecutive month of incentives trending below $1,000. More from Personal Finance:\nHere's how to combat inflation with Labor Day deals\n50% of employers expect job cuts, survey finds\nAmericans spend $314 a month on impulse purchases At the same time, the average price for a new car reached an estimated $46,259 in August \u2014 11.5% higher than a year ago and the highest on record, according to the J.D. Power/LMC forecast. \"Shoppers waiting for Labor Day sales events with substantial discounts on outgoing model-year vehicles will be frustrated by the lack of markdowns and choice of vehicles,\" said Thomas King, president of the data and analytics division at J.D. Power, in the report. However, even as the average sales price for a new car continues pushing higher, Labor Day deal shoppers may find a general easing in prices for used vehicles. \"Car shoppers can't expect to find anything close to the doorbuster bargains of pre-pandemic Labor Day sales, but they can at least look forward to used car prices softening across the board heading into the holiday weekend,\" said Jessica Caldwell, executive director of insights at Edmunds. \"Although these price drops are not earth-shattering, they should be a welcome reprieve for consumers compared to the continued higher cost of new car purchases or leases,\" Caldwell said. As the calendar gets closer to 2023, used vehicles are getting older and racking up more mileage, so they generally are selling for less than they did earlier in the year, according to Edmunds. Additionally, an uptick in the number of near-new cars (no more than 2 years old) making their way to the used market via trade-ins is pushing down the price of 3-year-old vehicles. The average sales price for 3-year-old vehicles was $31,302 in July, down 4.6% from their peak of $32,828 in January. Across more than 200 models in that age group, 92.8% have experienced a price decline this year. For instance, a 2019 Ford Fusion Energi, a plug-in hybrid electric car, sold for an average $17,514 in July. That's a $3,776 drop \u2014 17.7% \u2014 from its $21,290 peak in March. For a 2019 GMC Yukon, a full-size SUV, the average price in July was $50,478, which is $6,602 lower, or 11.6%, than its high of $57,080 in January. There's also good news for those trading in a used car for one of those pricey new ones. The average trade-in in August was worth an estimated $10,011, a 32.7% jump from a year ago and the third consecutive month above $10,000, according to the J.D. Power/LMC report. The auto industry continues to operate in a challenging environment due to supply chain issues, including a persistent shortage of computer chips. That shortage has led to elevated prices in both the new and used markets as consumer demand remains strong. In August, an estimated 55% of vehicles were sold within 10 days of arriving at a dealership, according to the J.D. Power/LMC Automotive. The average number of days that new cars are on a dealer's lot before being sold is about 20 days, down from 25 days during the year-earlier period."},

The agency claims Kochava violated a section of the FTC Act that prohibits unfair deceptive practices in commerce. Using data Kochava collected on mobile devices and combining it with public map programs, the FTC found it was possible to infer the identity of the device owner by linking those devices to sensitive locations and tracing them back to single-family homes. The agency claimed that until at least June of this year, Kochava would grant users access to a sample data set of time-stamped location information from 61 million unique mobile devices, with relatively little effort required by the user seeking access to the data. The FTC claims Kochava was aware of this potential use, marketing its services on the Amazon Web Services Marketplace with the suggestion of using its information \"to map individual devices to households.\" The agency argues in its complaint filed in federal court in Idaho that identification via Kochava's location data \"is likely to injure consumers through exposure to stigma, discrimination, physical violence, emotional distress, and other harms.\" It added that Kochava could have installed reasonable safeguards to protect consumer information, like by blacklisting information associated with sensitive locations so that it would not appear in data sets, such as addiction recovery centers, shelters or medical facilities. \"This lawsuit shows the unfortunate reality that the FTC has a fundamental misunderstanding of Kochava's data marketplace business and other data businesses,\" Kochava Collective General Manager Brian Cox said in a statement. \"Kochava operates consistently and proactively in compliance with all rules and laws, including those specific to privacy.\" Cox said the company announced a new ability to block location data from sensitive locations prior to the FTC's lawsuit. He said the company engaged with the FTC for weeks explaining the data collection process and hoped to come up with \"effective solutions\" with the agency. \"Unfortunately the only outcome the FTC desired was a settlement that had no clear terms or resolutions and redefined the problem into a moving target,\" Cox said. \"Real progress to improve data privacy for consumers will not be reached through flamboyant press releases and frivolous litigation. It's disappointing that the agency continues to circumvent the lawmaking process and perpetuate misinformation surrounding data privacy.\" The FTC voted 4-1 to bring the lawsuit, with Republican Commissioner Noah Joshua Phillips voting against filing the complaint. The commission's other Republican, Christine Wilson, voted with the Democratic majority. The lawsuit builds on the agency's focus on privacy, after announcing earlier this month it is exploring new rules to crack down on commercial surveillance and lax data security.

Two members of the labor board dissented on the Tesla ruling, while three moved to overrule the prior Walmart decision. The majority wrote, \"when an employer interferes in any way with its employees' right to display union insignia, the employer must prove special circumstances that justify its interference.\" Tesla did not demonstrate special circumstances that justified its policy, the NLRB decided. Tesla had previously argued before the NLRB that its dress code was meant to prevent workers' clothing from \"causing mutilations\" to the cars or car seats they were building, and to help managers \"easily determine that employees are in their assigned work areas,\" of the company's factory. Former Tesla employees had testified before the NLRB that management at Tesla made them remove T-shirts with United Auto Workers union messages and logos on them, even though they posed no risk of damaging cars or car seats. The UAW and Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday. Previously, the NLRB ruled that Tesla CEO Elon Musk violated labor laws when he suggested in a tweet that Tesla workers would need to give up their stock options if they unionized.

The Japanese gaming giant launched PlayStation Studios Mobile Division on Monday and said it will run independently of the console business. Sony also said on Monday it acquired Helsinki- and Berlin-based mobile game developer Savage Game Studios. The move comes after a tough second quarter for Sony's gaming division, and the company's downgrading of its full-year profit forecast for the business as the Covid-induced boom \u2014 during which people were stuck at home playing video games \u2014 begins to fade. Sony also continues to face supply chain issues and cannot meet the demand for its flagship PlayStation 5 console. Sony has dominated the console market for several years, thanks to the PlayStation. But the company is now looking to diversify. This year, the Japanese gaming giant said it plans to release around 50% of games on PC and mobile by 2025, up from about a quarter currently. \"For that to happen, Sony needs to make big bets on mobile gaming,\" Serkan Toto, CEO of Tokyo-based game industry consultancy Kantan Games, told CNBC. And the opportunity is big. Consoles account for about 27% of the $196.8 billion games market, whereas mobile makes up more than half of revenues, according to Newzoo. The purchase of Savage Game Studios continues Sony's recent acquisition drive as it looks to boost the development of titles across platforms. \"PlayStation Studios must continue to expand and diversify our offering beyond console, bringing incredible new games to more people than ever before,\" said Hermen Hulst, head of PlayStation studios. \"Acquiring the talented team at Savage Game Studios is another strategic step towards that goal.\" Sony said that Savage Game Studios is working on an \"unannounced new AAA mobile live service action game.\" A \"triple A\" game is an informal industry classification usually for a blockbuster type of title. A live service game is usually a title where developers continually update and add content to extend its lifetime and generate revenue over a longer period of time. The success of Call of Duty Mobile and Diablo Immortal on mobile, both of which were originally designed for console and PC, show there is demand for well-known titles on smaller screens \"if executed well,\" according to Daniel Ahmad, senior analyst at Niko Partners. Sony's mobile strategy is likely to lean on its massive library of intellectual property (IP) but also with a focus on developing specific games for smaller devices, Kantan Games' Toto said. \"Sony is very likely to not only bring existing PlayStation IPs to mobile but also encourage studios to develop new franchises for smart devices from scratch,\" Toto said. Sony is the latest console maker to make a big step into mobile gaming. Microsoft's Xbox gaming unit has also begun making early moves into mobile. Nintendo has, for the last three years, also been focusing a lot of effort on the smaller screen gaming format. Globally, Sony will compete with companies it hadn't really before, particularly Chinese giants Tencent and NetEase \u2014 two of the world's largest mobile gaming players. But Toto said Sony's chances of success are still high. \"The mobile gaming market is overcrowded. There are over 1 million games in app stores nowadays. But players such as Sony, even if they are new entrants, can still make it just because of their fire power,\" Toto told CNBC. \"There are not many companies like Sony out there, with such strong branding, a whole range of high-performing studios and a treasure trove of valuable IPs.\""},

The layoffs will begin on Wednesday, the report said, and will affect certain departments including hardware and developer products.

In its Q2 investor letter on July 21, Snap said it would not provide guidance for its current quarter and said \"forward-looking visibility remains incredibly challenging.\" Snap shares dropped more than 25% on the day it reported its second quarter earnings. The company's disappointing results kickstarted a wave of social media companies reporting poor results, citing a weak online advertising market, among other reasons. Facebook-parent Meta also missed analysts' estimates for its second quarter, as did Pinterest. The social media companies blamed some of their problems on businesses cutting back on digital advertising because of the weak economy. Additionally, these companies have said that a 2021 privacy update to Apple's iOS has made it more difficult for them to track users, thus negatively impacting their online ad units.

{"url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/29/apple-iphone-14-event-preview-september-2022.html", "title": "Expect Apple to show four new iPhones and an updated Apple Watch next week", "tag": "Tech", "author": "Kif Leswing", "datetime": "2022-08-29 18:11:43", "paragraphs": " Apple is holding a launch event at its headquarters in Cupertino, California, on Sept. 7. The company is expected to announce new iPhone models, as it has every September since 2012. Apple has used prerecorded videos for its launch events since early 2020 thanks partly to Covid restrictions, and this will be the first iPhone launch with an in-person component since 2019. Apple is streaming the launch event online on its website and YouTube in addition to inviting some media to its campus. Apple's hype-filled fall launches are a signature event for Apple. They typically draw millions of simultaneous viewers on YouTube. They garner attention from around the world and set the stage for a holiday marketing blitz during the last three months of the year, which is when Apple's sales are the highest. This year's event has the tagline \"far out,\" which could refer to features such as night-sky photography. Last year, Apple released new iPhones and Apple Watches at an event in September, and then followed it up with an October launch featuring iPads and Macs. Here's what Apple is likely to launch next Wednesday, based on reports. Apple is expected to release four new iPhone models. If Apple's current naming convention holds up, they will be called the iPhone 14. This year Apple will likely discontinue the \"mini\" model with a 4.7-inch screen, according to reports. Instead, Apple could offer two sizes, one with a 6.1-inch screen and one with a 6.7-inch screen, each coming in a standard model and a pricier \"Pro\" model. The Pro models are expected to get more upgrades, according to reports from Bloomberg News, TFI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, and other analysts and Apple watchers. Since 2017, iPhones have included a space at the top of the phone's display with space for Apple's FaceID system, which includes several sensors and a camera. The Pro models could ditch Apple's \"notch\" where it houses the FaceID camera for a slimmer, more streamlined \"pill\" or \"cutout\" approach with a smaller space that has to remain blank, leaving room for an even larger display. The Pro models are also expected to get upgraded A16 processors and cameras. The camera bump is expected to get larger. Apple could release an always-on screen display for showing notifications, like some Android phones have sported for years. Beta iPhone software released over the summer suggested that Apple may be planning a similar feature because of new widgets that show weather and battery life. One of the biggest questions is how Apple will price its iPhones in a period of inflation around the world and macroeconomic uncertainty in some regions. Other consumer electronics, such as Sony's Playstation 5, have seen price cuts. Apple's least-expensive iPhone 13 model is the $699 iPhone 13 Mini, which is expected to be discontinued. That would make Apple's mainline device, which is currently the iPhone 13, the least-expensive new model at $829, if its price doesn't change. Some analysts also expect Apple to increase the price of its Pro models. Apple usually drops the price of older models when it releases new ones, giving more price-sensitive consumers an option. Apple is likely to show the eighth major new version of its watch next week. Last year, the Apple Watch Series 7 got a slightly larger screen, but the redesign did not significantly change the look and feel of the device, which has remained mostly the same since 2014. Expect more evolution this year, too. Apple is considering a body temperature sensor in the new devices, according to the Wall Street Journal, which could help with fertility and sleep tracking. Other sleep tracking features could include the ability to detect advanced sleep patterns or apnea. But the biggest Apple Watch Series 8 announcement could be a new \"Pro\" model with a bigger screen and more durable finish. Apple has previously released Apple Watches with pricey case materials such as gold, ceramic and titanium, and the new \"Pro\" model described by Bloomberg and Kuo could be one of the first high-end Apple Watches to gain additional features over its less-expensive siblings. Also likely: A new updated version of the Apple Watch SE, its $329 entry-level Watch model. IPhone owners who don't plan to buy any new gear this fall will still get an annual update to the iPhones software, iOS 16, which was announced in June and has been in testing over the summer. The software has several new features that users will immediately notice. The biggest banner feature is the ability to customize the iPhone's lock screen with widgets that can display weather forecasts, calendar appointments and other information at a glance. Users can also change the font for the lock screen clock for the first time, as well. IOS 16 also lets you unsend or edit iMessage text messages, as long as you catch them within a few minutes of sending. IOS 16 will also introduce short-term loans from Apple called Apple Pay Later. The feature will allow users to buy stuff online with Apple Pay but pay for the item in four installments without paying interest. One cool feature in iOS 16 is if a user has both an iPhone and a Mac laptop or desktop, they can use the iPhone as a very high-definition web camera. Apple is unlikely to release new iPads next week because their software isn't ready yet. Earlier this month, Apple told TechCrunch that iPadOS, the iPad software, will ship after iOS this fall, suggesting a staggered release. Apple's statement was terse, and the company dislikes talking about unannounced products. But in general, it likes to release new hardware together with new software, so the statement clearly suggested that new iPads would come at a later launch date than iPhones. IPadOS and iOS are very similar, but this year iPadOS is getting a feature called Stage Manager that could allow users to multitask more efficiently \u2014 but also got panned by early testers. Improved iPads could include more powerful processors that are closers to laptop processors, smoother displays and better integration with accessories. Apple also uncharacteristically teased a new \"Mac Pro\" in the spring. The Mac Pro is currently a $5,000 tower of power using an Intel processor. Apple wants to transition its entire Mac lineup away from Intel to its own M-series processors, but a pricey niche product doesn't fit as well with Apple's mass-market iPhones and Apple Watches. Instead, new Macs could be announced at a separate event later this year, as happened last year."},

Google said the app lacks effective systems for moderating user-generated content, which violates the store's terms of service. \"On Aug. 19, we notified Truth Social of several violations of standard policies in their current app submission and reiterated that having effective systems for moderating user-generated content is a condition of our terms of service for any app to go live on Google Play,\" the tech company, which is owned by Alphabet, told CNBC in a statement Tuesday. Axios first reported the Google statement. The restriction means that Android users, who make up 44% of smartphone users in the U.S., can't download the app. Google will not let the app go live until the content issues are addressed. Truth Social acknowledged Google's concerns and said it would work on addressing these issues, according to Axios. Trump Media and Technology Group CEO Devin Nunes told a different story. The former lawmaker, who was one of former President Donald Trump's staunchest allies in Congress, said the decision is up to Google and not dependent on Truth Social's policies. \"When are we going to be available on Android? Well, look, that's up to the Google Play store. We're waiting on them to approve us, I don't know what's taking so long,\" Nunes said on the \"Just the News Not Noise\" podcast. \"It sure would be nice if they would approve us.\" Google said that Nunes' statements misrepresent the ongoing dialogue between Trump Media and the Play store. Google reiterated that Truth Social's violations, and the steps to redress them, have been clearly communicated with the company. Trump Media pushed back, saying Truth Social was creating a \"vibrant, family-friendly environment.\" \"TMTG has no desire to litigate its business matters in the public sphere, but for the record, has promptly responded to all inquiries from Google,\" the company said in a press release Tuesday. \"It is our belief that all Americans should have access to Truth Social no matter what devices they use. We look forward to Google approving Truth Social at their earliest convenience.\" Trump Media and Technology Group made the app available for preorder on Android in early August. It is available on Apple's App Store. Google's YouTube has suspended Trump's channel. Android users can still access Truth Social through the platform's website. The restriction is one of several obstacles faced by the former president's app. Truth Social was created as a \"free-speech\" alternative to Twitter, after Trump was banned from the platform for his tweets relating to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Hundreds of the president's supporters stormed the building that day to try to block Congress from confirming Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election. Trump, who had about 88 million followers on Twitter, has about 4 million followers on Truth Social, where he continues to push false claims about the election. He is facing a criminal investigation over secret government records he took with him to his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida and is considering another run for the White House. Trump Media was set to go public through a merger with Digital World Acquisition Corporation, a special-purpose acquisition company. The deadline is Sept. 8, although DWAC is pushing for a delay of up to a year. DWAC warned shareholders that a decline in the former president's popularity could hurt the app and that, without a delay, the acquisition company may have to liquidate. DWAC scheduled a shareholder meeting for Sept. 6, two days before the current merger deadline. Shares of the company were down more than 2% Tuesday at $24.65, far from their peak of about $97 in March."},

The company will invest up to $1 billion in the new factory, which it plans to build in the Southeast of the U.S. The newly announced plant will be the panel maker's fourth fully integrated U.S. factory. First Solar also said Tuesday that it will spend $185 million upgrading and expanding its existing facilities in Ohio. CEO Mark Widmar pointed to the IRA as the key catalyst that made the company decide to build another factory in the U.S. rather than looking elsewhere. The funding packages create, for the first time, a \"long-term view and understanding of the industry, and policies aligned to that industry,\" he told CNBC. \"With that level of clarity, we stepped back and evaluated the alternatives or the options of where we could go with our next factory and when we looked at it comprehensively the U.S. was a very attractive option,\" he said. Widmar added that this is the first time the entire supply chain has been incentivized, from the manufacturer to the generating asset and finally to the end customer. \"With that type of alignment, you can create partnerships and opportunities to grow together collectively and more of a win-win type of structure than maybe we had before the implementation of the IRA,\" he said. First Solar said the new factory will manufacture 3.5 gigawatts of solar modules annually by 2025, with the company's Ohio facilities posting cumulative annual production capacity of over 7 GW by 2025. By comparison, the U.S. added 3.9 GW of solar capacity during the first quarter of 2022, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. The country's total solar industry now stands at 126.1 GW, which is enough to power 22 million homes, according to SEIA. Shares of First Solar have surged 65% since the end of July when Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V. announced their surprise agreement on the climate, health care and tax bill. The legislation, which swiftly passed the House and Senate and was signed into law by President Joe Biden, benefits First Solar in several ways, including through the production tax credit for domestic manufacturers. First Solar is the largest U.S.-based developer of solar panels, with a focus on utility-scale panels. The factory announcement comes as First Solar struggles to keep pace with booming demand. During its second quarter earnings call, First Solar said it's sold out through 2025, with a backlog of 44 GW. Widmar said First Solar wants to move quickly when building out its new factory. One of the company's considerations is a site that's as close to shovel-ready as possible. Other factors include the type and availability of workers in the area. First Solar is aiming to have identified the site by the end of the current quarter. \"I think the industry is in the best position it ever has been\u2026for growth beyond any expectations that anyone would have envisioned,\" Widmar said."},

In the forthcoming book, \"Like, Comment, Subscribe: Inside YouTube\u2019s Chaotic Rise to World Domination,\" author Mark Bergen writes that the executive, known for being loyal to Google cofounders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, talked about becoming Tesla's Chief Operating Officer before becoming YouTube CEO in 2014. At the time, Wojcicki had been senior vice president of ads and commerce at Google and had been looking for a higher-level role, the book said, citing those close to her. \u201cBy then, Page had begun plotting his own exit \u2014 a plan to hand Google off to a trusted deputy, Sundar Pichai,\" Bergen reports. In a conversation, Laszlo Bock, Google's HR chief at the time, said he \"suggested Page could more easily clear the way for his chosen successor by moving Wojcicki to YouTube.\u201d The announcement of Wojcicki's appointment came as a shock to many Googlers, the book says. Wojcicki had one of the earliest connections to Google -- in 1998, she famously let Page and Brin, who still hold majority shareholder voting power of Google parent company Alphabet, work from her garage when they were starting the company. Her sister, 23andMe founder Anne Wojcicki was married and had kids with Brin. In the book, Bock compared Google to a family enterprise, and the book says Wojcicki often was able to get Page's attention. \u201cWhen people couldn\u2019t get him to see reason, she always could,\u201d said former Google director and early Silicon Valley workplace influencer Kim Scott, who referred to her in the book as \u201ca Larry whisperer.\u201d One example is how Google used search data. \"Wojcicki wanted to use search queries to inform ads people saw on all those banner ads Google ran across the web; if advertisers could target consumers based on searches and on websites, they might spend gobs more with Google,\" the book says. Page had long wanted to keep search data from everything else but Wojcicki \"felt this wasn\u2019t keeping up with trends in the ad industry, which sought ever more data.\u201d \u201cThe founders trust Susan maybe more than anybody on the planet,\" Patrick Keane, an early Google sales director, said in the book. \u201cYou could never get Susan rattled, no matter how challenging the moment was.\u201d YouTube was also discussed as a potential spinout, the book reports. The year after Wojcicki\u2019s appointment, in 2015, Larry Page, announced the creation of Alphabet, a new holding company, that would separate several businesses, including self-driving car Waymo and health sciences unit Verily, from Google. \u201cYouTube seemed like a natural splinter; it already operated with a different name and office,\" the book states. \"Leaders there considered plans to become a separate Alphabet unit, detached from Google. Wojcicki wanted to keep reporting to Page, who had appointed himself Alphabet CEO, rather than his successor at Google, Sundar Pichai. But ultimately it was decided YouTube was too intertwined with Google\u2019s business and machinery to leave. So it stayed at Google.\" Under Wojcicki's watch, YouTube grew to reach more than 81% of U.S. adults and generate nearly $29 billion in revenue in 2021."},

In 2020, Microsoft shuttered its own streaming service, Mixer, after signing a multimillion dollar to have the famous Fortnite player Tyler \"Ninja\" Blevins stream on its service exclusively. YouTube, Twitch's closest competitor, has found more success chipping away at Twitch's dominance.

Ringler said in the letter that the latest termination notice is \"not legally necessary\" to end the merger deal, but is being delivered in case the July 8 filing is \"determined to be invalid for any reason.\" The letter on behalf of Musk said the Zatko complaint \"alleges far-reaching misconduct at Twitter\u2014all of which was disclosed to Twitter's directors and senior executives, including (CEO) Parag Agrawal\u2014that is likely to have severe consequences for Twitter's business.\" Musk's lawyer said Zatko alleges that Twitter is in \"material noncompliance\" with its obligations under its 2011 agreement with the Federal Trade Commission. The letter laid out some of Zatko's other allegations including claims that Twitter is \"uniquely vulnerable to systemic disruption resulting from data center failures or malicious actors,\" something senior management knew about but \"ignored and sought to obfuscate.\" \"These allegations, if true, demonstrate that Twitter has breached the following provisions of the Merger Agreement, thereby giving the Musk Parties the right to terminate the Merger Agreement pursuant to its terms,\" the letter said. Twitter's legal team responded on Tuesday by sending a letter to Musk's legal representatives. Twitter said Musk's termination case is \"invalid and wrongful under\" the acquisition agreement. \"It is based solely on statements made by a third party that, as Twitter has previously stated, are riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies and lack important context,\" the letter written by William Savitt of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz law firm said. \"Contrary to the assertions in your letter, Twitter has breached none of its representations or obligations under the Agreement, and Twitter has not suffered and is not likely to suffer a Company Material Adverse Effect.\" Twitter said it intends to enforce the acquisition agreement and \"close the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon\" with Musk. Twitter's legal team said Musk's latest notice to terminate the deal is \"invalid for the independent reason that Mr. Musk and the other Musk Parties continue to knowingly, intentionally, willfully, and materially breach\" the acquisition agreement. The social media giant has previously responded to Zatko. In a memo to staff posted to Twitter on Aug. 23 by CNN correspondent Donie O'Sullivan, Agrawal described Zatko as \"a former Twitter executive who was terminated in January 2022 for ineffective leadership and poor performance.\" Zatko's attorneys issued a statement on Monday in response to that characterization, saying he \"put his career on the line because of his concerns about Twitter users, the public, and the company's shareholders.\" Twitter and Musk will go on trial on Oct. 17 in Delaware to resolve Musk's attempt to cancel his acquisition of the company unless they reach a settlement first. Since proposing the Twitter takeover, Musk has complained that the number of fake or spam accounts on the social media platform is higher than is being disclosed. In the July 8 letter, Musk's legal team claimed the company had \"failed or refused to provide\" information on these accounts to the Tesla CEO. Ahead of the October trial, Musk's legal team has subpoenaed Zatko, seeking information on the company's spam accounts and its alleged security vulnerabilities. \u2014 CNBC's Lora Kolodny contributed to this report."},

In a series of letters sent Tuesday morning, the committee asked four agencies, including the Department of the Treasury, the Federal Trade Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as five digital asset exchanges \u2014 Coinbase, FTX, Binance.US, Kraken, and KuCoin \u2014 for information and documents about what they are doing, if anything, to safeguard consumers against scams and combat cryptocurrency-related fraud. More than $1 billion in crypto has been lost to fraud since the start of 2021, according to research from the FTC. \"As stories of skyrocketing prices and overnight riches have attracted both professional and amateur investors to cryptocurrencies, scammers have cashed in,\" wrote Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D.-Ill., Chair of the Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy. \"The lack of a central authority to flag suspicious transactions in many situations, the irreversibility of transactions, and the limited understanding many consumers and investors have of the underlying technology make cryptocurrency a preferred transaction method for scammers.\" The letters ask that the federal agencies and crypto exchanges respond by Sept. 12 with information about what they are doing to protect consumers. The committee says that these responses could be used to craft legislative solutions. In particular, the letters ask that the exchanges produce documents dating back through Jan. 1, 2009, which display efforts to combat crypto scams and fraud, as well as show attempts made to \"identify, investigate, and remove or flag potentially fraudulent digital assets or accounts,\" as well as highlight discussions around \"whether to adopt more stringent policies.\" In one letter, addressed to Sam Bankman-Fried, the CEO and founder of FTX, the committee notes that \"while some exchanges review cryptocurrencies before listing them, others allow digital assets to be listed with little or no vetting.\" Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis found that 37% of crypto scam revenue last year went to \"rug pulls,\" a type of scheme that involves developers listing a token on an exchange, pumping it up, and then vanishing with the funds. Binance.US, which also received an inquiry from the committee on Tuesday, has been accused in a class action lawsuit of misleading consumers about the safety of investing in the U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin known as terraUSD (or UST, for short) and its sister token, luna. At their height, luna and UST had a combined market value of almost $60 billion. Now, they're essentially worthless. Concern over the safety of crypto funds parked on centralized platforms has also been gaining traction following the recent collapse of Voyager Digital and Celsius, both popular apps among retail traders because of the double-digit annual percentage yield once offered by the two companies. The subsequent bankruptcies of these two platforms have highlighted the question of who owns cryptocurrency assets when a custodial business goes belly up. In the bankruptcy proceedings of both Voyager and Celsius, customers are considered unsecured creditors, rather than federally-insured bank depositors, meaning there is no guarantee they will get any of their money back. As for the relationship between investor and crypto exchange, the terms and conditions vary. In a financial filing released in May, Coinbase said its users would be treated as \"general unsecured creditors\" in the event of bankruptcy. Krishnamoorthi also noted that the agencies often seem to be acting at cross-purposes and giving inconsistent guidance to private-sector players. \"Without clear definitions and guidance, agencies will continue their infighting and will be unable effectively to implement consumer and investor protections related to cryptocurrencies and the exchanges on which they are traded.\""},

The Hangzhou, China-headquartered firm bought Quantic Dream, marking the establishment of its first fully owned gaming studio in Europe. NetEase and its rival Tencent have been upping their efforts overseas as the Chinese domestic games market slows down amid tighter regulation. Over the years, Tencent has been prolific in acquisitions and investments in overseas gaming companies. NetEase is now catching up. This year alone, NetEase has set up gaming studios in Japan and the U.S. NetEase has typically been focused on PC and mobile gaming, extremely popular formats in China. Mobile gaming makes up more than half of its global games revenues. But more recently, the tech giant has been expanding into console games. Quantic Dream, a 25-year-old studio, will focus \"on creating and publishing its video games on all platforms, as well as supporting and publishing third-party developed titles,\" according to a press release. That highlights NetEase's intention to grow across mobile, PC and consoles. The acquisition of Quantic Dream is in line with NetEase's strategy of acquiring well-known international characters and franchises. Quantic Dream is currently developing a game called Star Wars Eclipse, based on Disney's space adventure movies. NetEase has already released mobile games based on the Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter. NetEase's international push comes as regulators in China continue to scrutinize the games market, though there are signs of some easing. Last year, authorities restricted the amount of time those under 18 years old could play online games and froze the approval of new titles. In China, games need the green light from regulators to be released and monetized. Those approvals restarted in April. In an interview with CNBC last year, Hu Zhipeng, vice president at NetEase and one of the top bosses of the technology giant's video games business, said that he aims to eventually have 50% of the company's gaming revenue come from overseas, up from around 10% now. Competition in the global games market is heating up. Sony, a leader in console gaming and producer of the PlayStation, announced on Tuesday that it is setting up a dedicated mobile division, which will put it in competition with the likes of Chinese giants Tencent and NetEase."},

It's also working with dairy farmers to help them reduce emissions produced on their farms. While electricity and transportation tend to get most of the attention when it comes to global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, agriculture is a massive contributor. Breakthrough Energy Ventures has segmented global emissions into five categories, and agriculture is the third worst offender, responsible for 19% of total greenhouse gas emissions, behind manufacturing (31%) and electricity (27%), but ahead of transportation (16%) and buildings (7%). Neutral Foods milk is in about 2,000 grocery stores and has already received funding from a diverse roster of celebrity investors, including Mark Cuban, NBA stars LeBron James and Kevin Love, Tobias Harris, and musicians John Legend and Questlove. The company is planning to expand into butter, and eventually meat. \"It's clear that consumers are hungry for sustainable, climate-forward options and they're reflecting that in their purchasing decisions, especially when it comes to buying food and beverages,\" Carmichael Roberts, one half of the investing committee at Bill Gates' investment fund, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, told CNBC. Neutral Foods measures the carbon emissions of the entire lifecycle of its products and purchases carbon offsets for the measured emissions, Ann Radil, the Head of Carbon Reduction at Neutral Foods, told CNBC. Carbon credits are permits that businesses buy to certify greenhouse gasses have been removed from the atmosphere. While not all carbon credits are reliably policed, Neutral Foods says it uses only offsets verified by Climate Action Reserve (CAR), which it says are quite strict. CAR offsets are \"real, additional, permanent, verifiable, and enforceable,\" said Lauren Brown, senior manager of carbon reduction data and analytics for Neutral Foods. Long-term, the company's plan is to work with farms to reduce their greenhouse emissions directly. Currently, Neutral Foods has eight distinct projects underway at farms it works with and 30 projects in some phase of development, Radil told CNBC. Those projects include changing what cows eat and changing how cow manure is managed. Separating and composting manure \"alone can reduce manure-related GHG emissions like methane and nitrous oxide by 19 to 50 percent,\" Radil told CNBC. Also, Neutral Foods is working with farms to change the way they plant things on the farm to improve the amount of carbon that gets absorbed by the soil. The start-up both guides farmers to help them make changes in the operations on their farms to reduce emissions and then also provides the financing to make those changes, explains CEO Marcus Lovell Smith. Helping farmers lower the emissions on their farms requires approaching farmers with respect. \"You don't go onto a farm and tell a farmer what to do,\" said Smith, who runs his own dairy farm in New Hampshire. \"Farmers are one of the most independent minded groups of people in the country. So I learned that pretty quickly.\" One partner is Groeneveld Farms, a dairy farm with 240 cows, located in Snohomish County, Washington. The farm grows 90% of its feed, and Neutral Foods has helped it figure out how to plant two different crops -- corn and grass -- at the same time.This process, sometimes known as \"co-cropping\" or \"relay cropping\" means the farm only has to till the ground once, which decreases the amount of fossil fuels used on the farm. \"We can do this in a way that works really well for where we are located here in Washington,\" Groeneveld told CNBC. \"Neutral found this appealing and it's something that works within both of our collective budgets to try out.\" Neutral Foods started its product line with milk, which it currently sells at Amazon -owned Whole Foods, Target stores on the West Coast, Sprouts, and various other grocers. The price of Neutral Foods is \"pretty much in the middle of the pack for organic milk,\" CEO Smith said. Results so far are positive. \"We are pleased with how customers are reacting and purchasing the Neutral Foods products. Based on that, we are looking at other opportunities to expand with them into other items,\" said Sprouts spokesperson Steve Nieto. Starting in August, Neutral Foods will start selling carbon neutral pasture-raised butter, and it's planning to expand its product repertoire to include beef as well. Carman Ranch, located in the Wallowa Valley in northeast Oregon, raises cows and hogs. Owner Cory Carman, reached out to Neutral Foods to see they were working on any carbon emissions tracking programs for beef. \"We know that there are so many innovations in agriculture that can make a huge difference in greenhouse gas emissions or carbon sequestration, but discovering how those innovations play out in specific regions, or testing new ones is incredibly hard for individual ranchers,\" Carman told CNBC. Carman Ranch is what is called a \"century farm\" because the same family has worked the farm for over a hundred years. Cory herself grew up on the ranch and has worked at the ranch for the last two decades. \"Neutral has helped bring us technology, resources, and information that I would never had access to and that I am now sharing across my network.\" Carman Ranch has learned about feed supplements for cattle that lower the methane that cows belch out when they digest their food, Carman told CNBC. Currently, Carman Ranch is running trials with Neutral Foods to plant feed for their cows to graze on that contain condensed tannins. \"They are nutritious to our animals, promote soil health and can lower methane emissions,\" Carman told CNBC. Carman Ranch is also running a trial with Neutral Foods to put a seaweed supplement into the feed for 50 cattle. For this pilot program, Neutral Foods and the company making the seaweed supplement, Symbrosia, \"will bring leading researchers, partners, equipment, and procedures to measure methane emissions and weight gain, conduct a full life cycle analysis, and generate verified carbon credits,\" Carman said. It will take time for the projects Neutral Foods is doing with farms to be fully implemented and measurably reduce the emissions of their products, Radil told CNBC. But for now, Gates' investment fund is encouraged by the steps Neutral Foods is making. \"It sends a critical price signal to farmers that climate-forward practices have value. As they continue to improve upon those decarbonization techniques, there's an opportunity for scale at the farm level that can mirror the brand's growth and retail expansion,\" Roberts told CNBC. Fellow investor Marc Cuban, who put money into the company last October, agrees. \"I think consumers are becoming increasingly concerned about the impact of the products they consume on the environment,\" Cuban told CNBC. \"I think Neutral is well positioned to meet that demand.\""},

The lawsuit also names MicroStrategy as a defendant. Racine alleges the company conspired to help Saylor evade the taxes. The AG's office said it's seeking to recover a total sum of over $100 million in unpaid taxes and penalties. Shares of MicroStrategy were down more than 6% Wednesday afternoon on the news. Saylor, who oversaw the company's push into bitcoin, stepped down as CEO earlier this month. Under his leadership, MicroStrategy spent close to $4 billion acquiring bitcoin at an average price of $30,700, and he has said he considers the company's stock a sort of bitcoin ETF. Saylor allegedly claimed to reside in Virginia or Florida, which have lower or no personal income tax rates, while actually living in several different homes around D.C., including a penthouse apartment in the Georgetown neighborhood or on his yacht on the Georgetown waterfront or Potomac River when the apartment was undergoing renovations, according to the lawsuit. The suit includes several screenshots of posts that appear to be from Saylor's Facebook page dating back several years and referencing the view from his \"Georgetown balcony\" and discussing his \"home\" while tagging Washington, D.C. MicroStrategy allegedly \"had detailed information confirming that Saylor was in fact a DC resident,\" according to a press release, but it chose to withhold that information. In a statement, MicroStrategy said, \"The case is a personal tax matter involving Mr. Saylor. The Company was not responsible for his day-to-day affairs and did not oversee his individual tax responsibilities. Nor did the Company conspire with Mr. Saylor in the discharge of his personal tax responsibilities. The District of Columbia's claims against the Company are false and we will defend aggressively against this overreach.\" Around 2014, the AG's office claims in the lawsuit, MicroStrategy's then-chief financial officer confronted Saylor about his alleged tax evasion being a potential liability for the company. Saylor and MicroStrategy ended up reaching an agreement where Saylor's salary would be reduced to a nominal $1, the lawsuit claims, in order to reduce the risk authorities would discover the alleged scheme. Still, the AG alleges, Saylor continued to benefit from \"fringe benefits\" with a \"high cash value,\" such as use of the company plane. \"A decade ago, I bought an historic house in Miami Beach and moved my home there from Virginia,\" Saylor said in a statement. \"Although MicroStrategy is based in Virginia, Florida is where I live, vote, and have reported for jury duty, and it is at the center of my personal and family life. I respectfully disagree with the position of the District of Columbia, and look forward to a fair resolution in the courts.\" The suit is the first to be brought under a recently passed law called the False Claims Act, according to Racine's office. The district law incentivizes whistleblowers to report tax fraud and allows the court to impose penalties up to three times the amount of the evaded taxes, according to the AG's office. The district suit follows a separate complaint filed by whistleblowers against Saylor in April 2021, accusing him of failing to pay income taxes from 2014 through 2020. The complaint was filed under seal but made public on Wednesday. The AG's office said it independently investigated the whistleblower case and found MicroStrategy had filed inaccurate W-2s with his Florida-based address and had failed to withhold taxes allegedly owed to the district. The new lawsuit alleges Saylor failed to pay income tax he owed to the district starting in 2005. \u2014 MacKenzie Sigalos contributed to this story.

The Swedish payments firm generated revenues of 9.1 billion Swedish krona ($950 million) in the period spanning January to the end of June 2022. That was up 24% from a year ago. But the company also racked up hefty losses. Klarna's pre-tax loss soared more than threefold year-on-year to nearly 6.2 billion krona. In the first half of 2021, Klarna lost around 1.8 billion Swedish krona. The company, which allows users to spread the cost of purchases over interest-free installments, saw a jump in operating expenses and defaults. Operating expenses before credit losses came in at 10.8 billion Swedish krona, up from 6.3 billion krona year-over-year, driven by administrative costs related to its rapid international expansion in countries like the U.S. Credit losses, meanwhile, rose more than 50% to 2.9 billion Swedish krona. Klarna had previously been profitable for most of its existence \u2014 that is up until 2019, when the firm dipped into the red for the first time after a hike in investments aimed at growing the business globally. The company's ballooning losses highlight the price of its rapid expansion after the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. Klarna has entered 11 new markets since the start of 2020, and took a number of costly gambits to extend its foothold in the U.S. and Britain. In the U.S., Klarna has spent heavily on marketing and user acquisition in an effort to chip away at Affirm, its main rival stateside. In the U.K., meanwhile, the firm acquired PriceRunner, a price comparison site, in April. It has also engaged in a charm offensive with British politicians and regulators ahead of incoming regulations. More recently, Klarna has been forced to cut back. In May, the company slashed about 10% of its global workforce in a swift round of job cuts. The company subsequently raised raised funds at a $6.7 billion valuation \u2014 an 85% drop from its previous valuation \u2014 in an $800 million investment deal that defined the capitulation from high-growth tech firms as investors grew wary of a possible recession. The sharp discount reflected grim sentiment among investors in fintech in both the public and private markets, with publicly-listed fintech Affirm having lost about three quarters of its market value since the start of 2022. \"We've had to make some tough decisions, ensuring we have the right people, in the right place, focused on business priorities that will accelerate us back to profitability while supporting consumers and retailers through a more difficult economic period,\" said Sebastian Siemiatkowski, CEO and co-founder of Klarna. \"We needed to take immediate and pre-emptive action, which I think was misunderstood at the time, but now sadly we have seen many other companies follow suit.\" Klarna said it plans to tighten its approach to lending, particularly with new customers, to factor in the worsening cost-of-living situation. However, Siemiatkowski said, \"You won't see the impact of this on our financials in this report yet.\" \"We have a very agile balance sheet, especially in comparison to traditional banks due to the short-term nature of our products, but even for Klarna it takes a little while for the impact of decisions to flow through.\" Fintech companies are cutting expenses and delaying listing plans amid a worsening macroeconomic backdrop. Meanwhile, consumer-oriented services are losing their appeal among investors while so-called \"business-to-business\" fintechs attract the limelight. Klarna says it is now used by over 150 million people, while the company counts 450,000 merchants on its network. Klarna mainly generates income from retailers, not users, taking a small slice of each transaction processed through its platform. \"Ultimately they've proven there can be a profitable business there but have doubled down on growing in the U.S. market which is expensive,\" Simon Taylor, head of strategy at fintech startup Sardine.ai, told CNBC. \"Market share there will be meaningful for long-term revenue. But it takes time and the funding taps aren't what they used to be.\" But the company faces stiff competition, with titans in the realms of both tech and finance seeking to capitalize on growth in the buy now, pay later industry. Apple is set to launch its own BNPL product, Apple Pay Later, this fall, which will allow users to split the cost of their purchases over four equal monthly payments. Meanwhile, proposals are afoot to bring the BNPL market under regulatory supervision. In the U.K., the government has announced plans to enforce tighter affordability checks and a crackdown on misleading advertisements. Stateside, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau opened a market-monitoring probe into BNPL companies."},

CEO Evan Spiegel announced the moves in a memo Tuesday, and told employees the company needs to restructure its business to deal with its financial challenges. He said the company's current year-over-year revenue growth rate for the quarter of 8% \"is well below what we were expecting earlier this year.\" \"While we have built substantial capital reserves, and have made extensive efforts to avoid reductions in the size of our team by reducing spend in other areas, we must now face the consequences of our lower revenue growth and adapt to the market environment,\" Spiegel said. \"We are restructuring our business to increase focus on our three strategic priorities: community growth, revenue growth, and augmented reality.\" Other projects the company nuked include its Snap Minis third-party apps and Snap Games. Spiegel said Snap is also starting the \"process of winding down\" its Zenly map product and Voisey music feature, which were both inherited through acquisitions. Snap has also promoted Jerry Hunter from senior vice president of engineering to chief operating officer. Hunter will continue leading Snap's engineering unit, Spiegel said. The company said it hired Ronan Harris, Google's vice president and managing director of U.K. and Ireland, to be its president of the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, a new position. Harris will join Snap's executive team. Spiegel said Snap is currently searching for presidents of the company's Asia-Pacific and Americas regions, also two new roles. \"Changes of this magnitude are never easy, and we must act decisively to meet this moment as a team,\" Spiegel said. \"I am proud of the strength and resilience of our team as we have navigated the myriad challenges of growing our business in a highly competitive industry during uncertain and unprecedented times.\" In July, Snap shares cratered more than 25% after the company reported second-quarter results that missed on both the top and bottom lines and said it would not provide guidance for its current quarter. The company said at the time that it planned to \"substantially\" slow its hiring rate and operating expense growth rate. Like other social media companies, including Facebook parent Meta, Pinterest and Twitter, Snap said a confluence of factors has simultaneously hurt the company's business. They include a weakening macroeconomic environment and Apple 's 2021 iOS update, which made it more difficult for social media companies to track users on behalf of third-party advertisers. The rise of TikTok's short-video service has also posed a significant challenge for Snap and its competitors. Snap said it was scrapping development of its Pixy drone after reports surfaced that the company was pausing its work on the device. The drone was supposed to be a fun way for users to take photos of themselves from multiple angles. Snap has been trying to build a consumer hardware business and announced the $230 drone in April."},

One of the enduring lessons of the iPhone era is that Steve Jobs led with what the consumer didn't know they wanted until he showed it to them. Robotics pioneer Rodney Brooks has operated from a similar idea \u2014 with varying degrees of success. His robot vacuum cleaner Roomba, and its parent company iRobot, which more or less made the category of robotic vacuums an inexpensive, must-have for many consumers, was recently sold to Amazon for $1.7 billion. \"iRobot found a product-market fit. It had a feature set and a cost that lots and lots of people were willing to pay for, that puck-shaped thing that cleans the floor pretty well,\" said Matt Beane, an assistant professor in the technology management program at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and a robotics expert. But another of Brooks' big, early ideas, hasn't worked out the way he or the world imagined. Rethink Robotics was founded in 2008 with the idea that a cobot \u2014 a robot working alongside humans in ways that traditional automation couldn't (i.e. with much less danger to the human), and without the fencing that most industrial robots remained inside \u2014 was a market waiting to be made among industrial customers. But for all the novel ideas that Brooks and his Rethink colleagues brought to the table, its first cobot never caught on. It caught on in the press, for sure, and if you were following tech news at the beginning of the last decade you likely saw Baxter and \"his eyes\" staring out from the screen between his arms at some point in a photo or video footage. At CNBC, we learned firsthand the limitations of working with novel industrial robots when we invited Baxter on-air for a live segment as part of Rethink being named to the inaugural Disruptor 50 list in 2013. For technical reasons, it would have been a lot more difficult than we imagined to get Baxter onto the television studio set. While he may not be a part of the robotic future anymore, there is no history of the cobot that can be written without Baxter. \"There is no such thing as the cobot without Rod Brooks,\" Beane said. \"Rethink started the industry.\" After a lot of early fanfare, reality set in for Rethink. By 2018, it was struggling to scale its operations and find enough buyers for Baxter, with its two-armed design proving to be a novel idea, but a mistake. \"No one needs a two-armed robot,\" Beane said, describing that design decision as \"humans projecting onto a robot their own physical form.\" Rethink pivoted, in what turned out to be a move made too late, to a one-armed robot named Sawyer. But the technology had other problems. Rethink bet on an approach that used elastic actuators \u2014 a technology one of Brooks co-founders was an expert on \u2014 which allowed the robot to perform \"force sensing,\" an approach the company backed because it would make the robots safer around human coworkers. Rethink's design would also make the robots low cost, getting rid of standard industry reliance on motors and related parts. Paul Maeder, a mechanical engineer who invested early in Rethink through his VC firm, told the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in a post-mortem on Rethink that goes deep into the technical shortcomings, that cheaper parts plus force sensing seemed like the way to bring down pricing in the robotics market and appeal to customers. And it did bring down pricing. \"The reality is that they had a very low price point, shockingly low,\" Beane said. \"They had done an amazingly good job at materials sourcing and design, and they were headed to one-third or one-quarter of the price for other robots.\" But Rethink never achieved the market penetration or scale it needed to maintain its operations. As the financials worsened, Rethink became the acquisition target of a Chinese firm, a deal Beane says would have had a good shot at getting the firm to scale. But that deal was scuttled \"at the last moment,\" according to the company, and a 2018 bankruptcy followed. Rethink was bought out of bankruptcy by German automation company Hahn Group, which is still trying to make the technology a success today. In a statement provided to TechCrunch at the time of its demise, Rethink said, \"We were early to market with a very innovative product that was ahead of its time, and unfortunately, we did not achieve the commercial success we had expected.\" It's true Rethink had no shortage of interesting, innovative ideas, even if they weren't the right ones for the market. According to Beane, one of the most intriguing was the ability for the cobot to be programmed by the worker. \"People don't make much of this feature anymore, but that was a graphic user interface system which didn't require code and you could teach it, train it to do a job as the worker,\" Beane said. \"But no manager would turn those features on,\" he added. That's an idea that Brooks is still working on today, through his latest robotics startup Robust.ai, co-founded with cognitive scientist Gary Marcus, which is making a warehouse cobot, Carter, that is like a mobile shopping cart providing transport within fulfillment centers. \"It can drive in any direction and is worker programmable and can physically collaborate,\" Beane said. \"A lot of the same DNA is there.\" Once Sawyer became the lead cobot, Rethink invested in a technology that integrated the cobot with preexisting industrial automation, an interesting approach, but ultimately, another bottleneck that was costly in engineering time to connect and to get to communicate with machinery like conveyors. \"Just to alter the speed of a conveyor is extremely expensive,\" Beane said. The DNA that has become standard in the cobot market that Baxter, and later Sawyer, hoped to dominate, is from Rethink rival and Denmark-based Universal Robots. While its cobots may be \"very boring looking\" in Beane's view, they were what the market ultimately wanted. \"In the end, the series elastic actuators were probably not the best idea in the world,\" Maeder told ASME. \"What customers really want is a low-cost, simple, fast, repeatable robot. They want to put something in this exact location again, and again and again. In the end, that was a lot more complicated for us to achieve than for some of our competitors because they weren't trying to do force sensing.\" Even the two arms that Baxter had could always be purchased by a buyer if they really wanted that approach, by purchasing two single-arm robots, and that's what Universal Robots \u2014 which was acquired by industrial automation company Teradyne in 2015 \u2014 excels at, with its UR3, UR5 and UR7 cobots leading to increased sales, and successive generations of its cobot line continuing to hit the market. The opportunity for robotics technology remains significant, though it is still trailing other automation approaches in market penetration. Robot sales in the North American market have been growing, and the Teradyne unit led by Universal Robots is seeing steady, if not explosive, sales growth, too. Revenue was $300 million in 2019, and then increased to $376 million last year after a Covid dip. According to Wall Street estimates, sales could reach $440 million this year, or about 18% growth. That growth rate is higher than the percentage of overall revenue it represents, which is still under 15%. \"A lot more will occur,\" Beane said. \"Progress often looks slow up close ... but the utility of a robotic system that can accomplish general tasks at a reasonable cost is extraordinary, billions, maybe trillions worth of value,\" he added. And costs keep going down, from batteries to sensors and software, meaning the price performance for robots keeps going up steadily. But where the cobot finds its greatest utility remains an open question. While the industrial world use has been in the first decades often as much a marketing ploy or, at best, an experiment rather than proof of widespread adoption, there is reason to forecast multiple roles for cobots based on an aging demographic. \"Anyone who says not in my lifetime, you better hope it is in your lifetime, because you will need help,\" Beane said. He anticipates that jobs outside of the manufacturing sector with which cobots have been associated \u2014 from warehousing to retail, medical (think cobots bringing supplies to nurses) and retirement communities \u2014 are areas poised for growing use. \"Manufacturing is about high throughput and high consistency and you can automate the heck out of it without a cobot,\" Beane said. \"We're only just getting started on this capability being useful and used at scale.\" Rodney Brooks is among the robotics experts who has spoken about a world that is getting older and a working population that is not as strong. He wrote in a blog post covering his annual predictions that \"soon the houses of the elderly will be cluttered with too many robots.\" Wall Street analysts are focused on the opportunity presented by a chronic labor shortage, and related changes taking place in a global outsourcing paradigm which economies including the U.S. have been relying on for decades. With \"near shoring\" and onshoring of more manufacturing activity, there is increasing demand for labor in a tight labor market. One answer is automation, and technology like Universal Robots is relatively easy to program and implement. But one big issue the cobots have not yet solved is the same one that started Brooks down the Rethink path: figuring out what everyone wants from this technology, the \"killer app,\" so to speak, for the cobot. Universal Robots has many different applications for its technology, but not a single one that drives strong demand within one very high volume market. That's a solvable problem, but still a work in progress. Robots running popcorn stations in a movie theatre or robot cafe baristas aren't the career opportunity that takes the cobots to center stage in the economy. But there is a shortage of people and automation has to be one of the solutions, even if it doesn't happen by tomorrow. We have not reached a world of genuine physical collaboration between human worker and cobot, Beane says, \"the kind of stuff where humans reach over to grab the next thing and the robot sees I am reaching and hands it to me and we might even brush up against each other,\" but, \"We are getting there,\" he added. The automated systems that are most widely deployed remain the ones that are more dangerous and kept at a distance. But Beane thinks that Rethink came closer to solving the problem than it is given credit for, and has yet to prove in its new life under Hahn. Hahn did not respond to a request for comment by press time. \"Another eight months and maybe they might have gotten product-market fit. It was inexpensive and reliable. I really do believe we could have seen an iPhone moment,\" Beane said. In his personal blog, Brooks summed up the Rethink story this way: \"Baxter and Sawyer were the first safe robots that did not require a cage to keep humans away from them for the humans' protection. And Sawyer was the first modern industrial robot which finally got away from having a computer-like language to control it, as all robots had since the idea was first developed at the Stanford AI Lab back in the very early seventies. There is still a lot remaining to be done.\""},

Speaking to CNBC's \" Street Signs Asia\" on Wednesday, Sanjay Kapoor, who is now an independent analyst, said Indian mobile operator Reliance Jio's $25 billion plan to launch 5G network across the country indicates that India is \"very serious\" about 5G. 5G refers to the fifth generation of high-speed mobile internet which offers super-fast download speeds and more bandwidth that's capable of supporting technologies like driverless cars and virtual reality applications, including the metaverse. According to Reuters, Reliance is making a push to roll out its network within two months. It is also developing an affordable 5G smartphone with Google, according to the report. \"But when you look at what's happening \u2026 [in] China, for example, a single operator puts in more than $15 [billion], $16 billion every year, and they've been doing it for the last couple of years,\" said Kapoor. \"From an international perspective, [$25 billion] seems pretty okay. But in India, it looks really colossal.\" In July, India kicked off its 5G auction ahead of a planned 2023 rollout. Bidders include three of the country's major mobile operators in India \u2014 Reliance Jio, the market leader, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea \u2014 as well as Indian billionaire Gautam Adani's Adani Enterprises. Kapoor said the battle for the 72 gigahertz of 5G spectrum will be a \"two-horse race\" between Reliance and Bharti Airtel. \"They will be neck-to-neck [and] the strategies might differ,\" he added. Reliance Industries' Jio deposited 140 billion rupees of earnest money with the Indian government in July \u2014 it was the largest sum among the contenders. The amount of earnest money deposited is an indication of the amount of spectrum a company wishes to buy. Bharti Airtel deposited 55 billion rupees, while Vodafone Idea put in an earnest money deposit of 22 billion rupees. Reliance may have had a first-mover's advantage with its recent announcement, but Bharti Airtel's postpaid customer base could give it an edge over its rival, Kapoor said. However, what customers really value is their experience with a service provider, he pointed out. \"Therefore, each one of them will have to strive for supremacy in the market to make sure that they have a positive customer experience and are able to be competitive and world-class.\" But India's 5G infrastructure still has some way to go before that can happen, according to Kapoor. \"To give a sizable rollout in a country as large as India, it's not going to be very easy,\" he said. \"Do we have completely fiberized sites? China, for example, has a million sites already \u2026 and we [have] roughly, to each operator, about 250,000 sites.\" He added that India is going to need \"a lot more\" fiberized sites before it can give coverage to every nook and corner. Fibre infrastructure is the backbone of ultra-fast 5G networks, where a large availability of fiber-optic cables are required. \"To the time when we really can boast about giving a great customer experience, I think we are two, three years away,\" Kapoor said."},

In a filing with the SEC, Nvidia said the U.S. government told the company on Aug. 26, about a new license requirement for future exports to China, including Hong Kong, to reduce the risk that the products may be used by the Chinese military. Nvidia said the restriction would affect the A100 and H100 products, which are graphics processing units sold to businesses. \"The license requirement also includes any future Nvidia integrated circuit achieving both peak performance and chip-to-chip I/O performance equal to or greater than thresholds that are roughly equivalent to the A100, as well as any system that includes those circuits,\" the filing said. The company expects that it could lose $400 million in potential sales in China in the current quarter after previously forecasting revenue of $5.9 billion. The new rule also applies to sales to Russia, but Nvidia said it doesn't have paying customers there. In recent years, the U.S. government has applied increasing export restrictions to chips made with U.S. technology because of fears that Chinese companies could use them for military purposes or steal trade secrets. Nvidia said it was applying for a license to continue some Chinese exports but doesn't know whether the U.S. government will grant an exemption. \"We are working with our customers in China to satisfy their planned or future purchases with alternative products and may seek licenses where replacements aren't sufficient,\" an Nvidia spokesperson told CNBC. \"The only current products that the new licensing requirement applies to are A100, H100 and systems such as DGX that include them.\" An AMD representative confirmed to CNBC that it had also received new licensing requirements from the U.S. Department of Commerce which it believed applied to its MI250 circuit, which is intended for artificial intellegence. AMD said it did not believe the new requirements would cause a material impact to its business.

The letter dated Friday from National Intelligence Director (DNI) Avril Haines to House Intelligence Committee chair Adam Schiff and Oversight Committee chair Carolyn Maloney also said the Justice Department and DNI \"are working together to facilitate a classification review\" of materials including those recovered during the search. Schiff and Maloney said in a joint statement they were pleased the government was \"assessing the damage caused by the improper storage of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago.\" Politico reported the letter earlier. The Justice Department on Friday disclosed that it was investigating Trump for removing White House records because it believed he illegally held documents including some involving intelligence-gathering and clandestine human sources \u2014 among America's most closely held secrets.

Thursday's announcement follows the largest climate funding package in U.S. history, which President Joe Biden signed into law in August. The package includes incentives to jump-start domestic supply chains for electric vehicle batteries, although Piedmont said plans for the plant were in development prior to the Inflation Reduction Act. Now that the company has selected the site in McMinn County, it will begin the process of securing the necessary permits, which can be lengthy. Still, the company is targeting construction beginning in 2023, with production starting in 2025. When fully operational, the plant will produce 30,000 metric tons of lithium per year, making it the largest lithium refining facility in the U.S, according to the company. Piedmont said it will churn out enough material to supply roughly 500,000 electric vehicles annually. Piedmont currently has no active mines in the U.S., so once the facility is up and running it will process spodumene concentrate from Piedmont's international operations in Quebec and Ghana. Eventually, the company hopes to use lithium that's mined domestically. The company has plans for a mine as well as another plant in North Carolina, although CEO Keith Phillips said it's challenging from a permitting perspective, since both the mine and the plant are on the same site. Albemarle runs the only meaningful lithium mine in the U.S., which is in Silver Peak, Nevada. Additionally, only 2.1% of lithium is refined in the U.S., according to data from Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. China dominates the industry, refining more than half of global lithium supply. Should Piedmont's North Carolina mine and plant secure the required permits, however, the company forecasts its lithium output doubling, with the company supplying 1 million electric vehicles per year. Piedmont Lithium's announcement also comes as automakers are rushing toward vast electric vehicle fleets. By some forecasts, there simply won't be enough lithium to meet demand in the foreseeable future. The International Energy Agency estimates that in order to meet the goals set forth in the Paris Agreement, lithium demand will grow by over 40 times by 2040. Building new mines takes years. They're capital intensive and can face permitting challenges. There are also those opposed to new mines, who argue that the world should instead focus on existing production. Piedmont's Phillips noted that in just the last year $33 billion has been announced for electric vehicle battery manufacturing plants in the U.S., which would require 500,000 metric tons of lithium annually. \"That is more than all the lithium hydroxide produced in the world currently, so clearly the industry is facing a critical resource shortage,\" he told CNBC. \"Anyone who can produce material to supply this market \u2014 especially domestically in the United States \u2014 will be in a favored position.\" Piedmont plans to invest around $600 million developing the Tennessee facility."},

The e-commerce platform is warning merchants who try to install Amazon's \"Buy With Prime\" button on their storefront that it violates Shopify's terms of service, and is also raising the specter of security risks, according to research firm Marketplace Pulse. Amazon introduced Buy With Prime in April, pitching it as a way for merchants to grow traffic on their own websites. The service lets merchants add the Prime logo and offer Amazon's speedy delivery options on their sites. Members of the retail giant's Prime loyalty club can check out using their Amazon account. Shopify will not protect merchants who try to use Buy With Prime against fraudulent orders, according to a screenshot of a notice Shopify sent to merchants. The notice also warns that Amazon's service could steal customer data, and charge customers incorrectly. Shopify's terms of service require merchants to use Shopify Checkout \"for any sales associated with your online store.\" Merchants can use checkout integrations that are part of Shopify's payments platform. In order to be part of the payments platform, providers have to agree to Shopify's Partnership Program Agreement and API terms. Buy With Prime competes directly with Shopify's instant checkout and payment service, Shop Pay. Shopify has sought to expand the feature beyond its own platform, striking deals with Facebook and Google last year to let customers use the system to make purchases. Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke welcomed the launch of Buy With Prime at the time of Amazon's announcement, saying the company was \"happy\" to integrate the feature into its platform. \"This fits perfectly into our world view,\" Lutke told investors on the company's first-quarter earnings call. \"And it's not nearly as zero-sum as some people make it out to be.\" Privately, Shopify may not have been as pleased about Buy With Prime. The Information reported in May that the launch sparked internal debate about whether Shopify should integrate the feature on its site. Additionally, a Shopify spokesperson told the publication that Lutke's comments only represented his opinion, adding that the company needed to gather more details before ruling on the issue. A Shopify spokesperson told CNBC in a statement: \"Shopify believes it's a good thing when a company like Amazon opens their infrastructure to more independent businesses to succeed in commerce.\" Shopify has become a popular alternative for sellers who are looking to sell products online, or diversify beyond Amazon. The Canadian company got its start providing businesses with software to help them build a presence online. Shopify in May acquired third-party fulfillment service Deliverr, putting it more directly in competition with Amazon's logistics arm. In response to Shopify's claims that Buy With Prime is insecure, an Amazon spokesperson said: \"We protect information collected via Buy with Prime, including shopper data, in accordance with Amazon's high security standards. We use this information to provide and improve Buy with Prime for merchants and shoppers.\" \"We use Amazon Pay to process payments for Buy with Prime orders. Amazon Pay is backed by the fraud protection technology used on Amazon.com,\" they added. \"Merchants have complete control over the prices customers are charged.\" Shopify said its terms of service are intended to protect merchants, and violations may trigger a warning.

Now, the cryptocurrency trading platform is going after Melbourne-based Thevamanogari Manivel and her sister, Thilagavathy Gangadory, to retrieve its money \u2014 along with 10% interest and legal fees. Court documents show that in May 2021 an employee for the Singapore-based trading platform mistakenly entered an account number into the payment amount field. Crypto.com realized it had accidentally sent Manivel millions of dollars in December 2021 when it was conducting a routine audit. Manivel spent about AU$1.35 million of the accidental windfall on a property, according to the filing. While cryptocurrency transactions are not reversible, centralized platforms can theoretically reverse payments in cases of fraud or error. But in this instance, the company did not discover the error until seven months later, after some of the money had allegedly been moved or spent. The company convinced authorities to freeze Manivel's bank account in February, but she had already transferred the money to other defendants named in the case, according to the filing. The judge ruled in Crypto.com's favor, and the case returns to court in October where a judge will determine next steps in the case. The suit comes at a difficult time for the platform.

The lawsuit, filed on Wednesday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, comes at a critical time for Arm as its owner Softbank hopes to soon list the firm on public markets after a deal to sell it to Nvidia fell through because of regulatory scrutiny. But the suit also threatens Qualcomm's expansion plans, as it was hoping to use Nuvia processor designs at the heart of the dispute to compete more directly with Apple's chips for iPhones and Macs, and possibly use them to crack the server chip market, a lucrative space dominated by Intel and AMD. Nuvia was founded by ex-Apple chip designers and Qualcomm spent $1.4 billion to acquire it in 2021. Qualcomm's current Snapdragon chips for smartphones are also based on Arm technology. Arm is seeking damages and to force Qualcomm to destroy information and hardware from the Nuvia acquisition including chips, dies, packaging and promotional materials. The dispute centers around the rights to develop a chip using Arm's instruction set architecture (ISA), a core piece of intellectual property with origins dating back to 1985 that outlines how a chip performs basic functions like accessing memory or basic arithmetic. Arm-based chips have been ascendant in recent years because they're more power-efficient than the x86-based chips made by Intel and AMD. Over 29 billion chips based on Arm technology were shipped in 2021, including the chips at the heart of Apple's iPhones, Macs and iPads. Some companies, like Apple, license the ISA from Arm, then design their own physical processor circuits to implement the ISA instructions. Other companies, like Qualcomm historically, also buy the rights to full core designs from Arm, marketed as Cortex. Arm reported $2.7 billion in sales from licensing and royalties in 2021. The suit highlights the tension between Arm's business licensing the underlying intellectual property to make processors that could compete with the company's own designs. Arm said last year that it considered Qualcomm to be a competitor and that architectural licenses pose a threat to its implementation business. Lawsuits over intellectual property and contracts in the semiconductor industry are common. But the Arm-Qualcomm lawsuit is a significant conflict over the ability to design the kind of chip at the heart of nearly every smartphone in the world. It could have significant ramifications for chip startups and could open up a path to adoption for open-source alternatives to Arm. Qualcomm general counsel Ann Chaplin said in a statement that the dispute was a departure from a \"longstanding, successful relationship.\" \"Arm has no right, contractual or otherwise, to attempt to interfere with Qualcomm's or NUVIA's innovations,\" Chaplin said. \"Arm's complaint ignores the fact that Qualcomm has broad, well-established license rights covering its custom-designed CPUs, and we are confident those rights will be affirmed.\" Meanwhile, Arm said in a statement that the company was \"left with no choice other than to bring this claim against Qualcomm and Nuvia to protect our IP, our business, and to ensure customers are able to access valid Arm-based products.\" Qualcomm bought Nuvia because it wanted its chips to have better performance than what it could do with an off-the-shelf Arm processor design, especially to compete with Apple's high-efficiency custom Arm cores. Nuvia, a startup founded by former Apple and Google engineers, was developing a server chip with custom cores under an architecture license. It also had access to Arm's core designs. After the acquisition, Qualcomm placed Nuvia at the heart of its smartphone and PC strategy, using the startup's cores to make its laptop processors more competitive with Apple's M-series chips in products launching as soon as 2023. Qualcomm was also pitching Nuvia-based cloud processors to cloud providers such as Amazon, according to Bloomberg News. Arm says in its lawsuit that Nuvia's architectural license didn't transfer to Qualcomm when it bought it. Qualcomm has an architectural license, Arm says, but needed Arm's consent to purchase and use Nuvia's custom core designs. Arm terminated its Nuvia licenses in March, it said. If that holds in court, Qualcomm's entire chip strategy could be in flux. There may be an alternative route, however. Karl Freund, founder and analyst at Cambrian AI Research, speculated that Qualcomm could try to use RISC-V, an open source alternative to Arm's instruction set. Arm told regulators in December that \"RISC-V's momentum is accelerating\" and that established vendors are increasingly using it instead of Arm's instruction set. A few startups are currently building CPU cores based on RISC-V, but it has yet to be used in high-volume smartphones, which all currently use Arm. Arm's efforts to enforce its intellectual property with long-term partners, however, will likely prompt companies building custom Arm cores to take another look at open-source alternatives."},

In April, more than 2,600 workers at Amazon's warehouse in Staten Island, known as JFK8, voted to join the Amazon Labor Union, becoming the first group to vote in favor of unionizing at one of the e-commerce giant's U.S. facilities. Amazon in May sought to overturn the results of the election. It submitted a filing to the NLRB accusing the federal agency's Brooklyn office of violating labor law by appearing to support the union drive. Amazon, which included 25 objections in its filing, also alleged that labor organizers intimidated workers to vote in their favor. Amazon's objections kicked off 24 days of hearings held via Zoom where lawyers for the company, NLRB's Region 29 office, and the ALU dissected conduct during the election. JFK8 workers and union organizers, including Chris Smalls, co-founder and interim president of the ALU, were among the more than a dozen witnesses called to testify. Lisa Dunn, the NLRB attorney presiding over the hearing, concluded in a filing Thursday that Amazon \"had not met its burden\" of establishing the agency, the union or any other parties \"engaged in objectionable conduct affecting the results of the election,\" NLRB spokesperson Kayla Blado said. Dunn also recommended ALU be certified as bargaining representative, Blado said. Amazon has until Sept. 16 to file objections to Dunn's recommendations, which will then be heard by a regional director of the NLRB. The regional director will determine whether to order a new union election, or certify the results of the April election, at which point Amazon will be required to start contract negotiations with the ALU. The union said in a statement that it's pleased with the hearing officer's recommendations. \"It is our hope that the Regional Director for Region 28 can expedite our certification and that the NLRB enforces Amazon's legal obligation to negotiate with the workers of the ALU,\" the union said in a release posted to Twitter. Representatives from Amazon and the NLRB didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The ALU, a grassroots organization of current and former Amazon employees, has sought to expand its reach beyond JFK8. The union in May failed to replicate its successful union campaign at another Staten Island warehouse, but it has gained traction elsewhere. Workers at an Amazon warehouse near Albany are seeking to be represented by the ALU. The NLRB has yet to set a date for that election. A Kentucky Amazon warehouse has also expressed interest in organizing under ALU. WATCH: How two friends formed Amazon's first U.S. union and what's next"},

The decision will affect flights by Xiamen, Air China, China Southern Airlines and China Eastern Airlines from Sept. 5 to Sept. 28. The U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) cited the recent cancellation of 26 American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines flights over Covid-19 cases. The suspensions include 19 China-bound flights from Los Angeles and 7 China Eastern flights from New York. The Chinese Embassy in Washington's spokesperson Liu Pengyu said the USDOT action was \"extremely irresponsible\" and \"groundlessly suspended Chinese airline flights.\" The embassy said China's Covid-19 \"circuit breaker\" measures were fair and transparent, applied both to Chinese and foreign airlines and were consistent with bilateral air transportation agreements. USDOT said as of Aug. 7 Chinese authorities had revised their policies so if the number of passengers on a flight to China testing positive for Covid-19 reached 4% of the total, one flight would be suspended. If it reached 8%, two flights would be suspended. USDOT said the U.S. has repeatedly raised objections with China, saying the rules place \"undue culpability on carriers\" when travelers test negative before boarding their flight from the United States only to \"test positive for Covid-19 after their arrival in China.\" Beijing and Washington have sparred over air services since the start of the pandemic. In January, the Transportation Department suspended 44 China-bound flights from the United States by the four Chinese carriers in response to China's decision suspend 44 flights by U.S. carriers. In August 2021, USDOT limited four flights from Chinese carriers to 40% passenger capacity for four weeks after Beijing imposed identical limits on four United Airlines flights. Three U.S. airlines and four Chinese carriers typically operate about 20 flights a week between the countries, well below the figure of more than 100 a week before the pandemic."},

The website called Temu, which went online Thursday, lists items across a number of categories including clothing, jewelry, pet supplies and home and garden, and could mark a new challenge to U.S. e-commerce leader Amazon. Pinduoduo did not respond to a request for comment when contacted by CNBC. Temu marks Pinduoduo's biggest push overseas yet as the domestic Chinese economy faces a number of challenges from a resurgence of Covid-19 to an energy crunch. That has hurt economic growth in China and dampened consumer sentiment. China's biggest technology companies from Tencent to Pinduoduo's e-commerce rivals Alibaba and JD.com continue to pursue international markets. Pinduoduo, a much younger company than Alibaba and JD.com, having only been founded in 2015, is behind its rivals when it comes to the overseas push. Alibaba took a controlling stake in Singapore-based Southeast Asian e-commerce site Lazada in 2016 and has since invested money in the business to expand its presence in the region. Alibaba also has a separate website called AliExpress that services markets like Europe and the U.S. JD.com meanwhile operates Joybuy.com for international customers. Pinduoduo's Temu is a cross-border e-commerce website with most products likely to come from overseas, especially China. Temu said shipping to the U.S. could take 7-15 business days. \"It's important to keep in mind that you may see longer delivery times than you're used to from other e-commerce websites. This is due to the fact that items that may be coming from another country or need to be bundled or packaged with other similar-sized items,\" the website says on the shipping information page. Shipping is free for orders over $49. Pinduoduo could face some challenges in cracking the U.S. market. First it will need to build brand reputation versus the likes of Amazon. And it could also suffer from its relatively long shipping times versus the same-day or next-day deliveries Amazon offers via its Prime subscription services. Temu's \"main challenges will be cultivating trust and awareness among customers,\" Jacob Cooke, CEO of WPIC, an e-commerce tech and marketing firm that helps foreign brands sell in China, told CNBC. There are currently also some categories that have very few products. For example, the men's wristwatch category had just two products listed. However, Temu could compete on price. On Thursday, Temu had a 20% discount offer sitewide. And products appear to be quite cheap. For example, the women's dresses listed were mostly under $20. Temu could also have an advantage due to \"existing relationships with low-cost manufacturers in China that maybe haven't expanded to the U.S. yet,\" Cooke said. Pinduoduo has grown quickly in its seven-year history to become one of China's biggest e-commerce firms. The company has tended to focus on lower-income consumers by offering heavily discounted products. And it has been focusing on bringing agricultural products onto its platform to differentiate from rivals. The company is worth around $87 billion."},

Chipmaker Nvidia's shares have plunged around 13% this week after the company disclosed new U.S. restrictions on its exports to China, affecting about $400 million in potential sales in the current quarter. In China, the Nvidia Drive Orin chip has become a core part of electric automakers' assisted driving tech. These semi-autonomous driving systems are an important selling point for the companies in what has become a fiercely competitive market in China. Some automakers are also using Nvidia's Xavier chip. Automotive is a relatively small but fast-growing part of Nvidia's business. However, the new U.S. restrictions target Nvidia's A100 and H100 products \u2014 and these chips' sales are part of the company's far larger data center business. The products are graphics processors that can be used for artificial intelligence. \"There shouldn't be any restrictions on Xavier and Orin, and Xpeng, Nio and others would continue to ship with those chips,\" said Bevin Jacob, partner at Shanghai-based investment and consulting firm Automobility. Jacob, however, did warn that there could be \"close scrutiny\" in the future on U.S. firms shipping chips relating to artificial intelligence and autonomous driving to China. Xpeng declined to comment. Nio, Li Auto, Huawei and Jidu \u2014 a new electric vehicle brand backed by Baidu and Geely \u2014 did not respond to requests for comment. The new U.S. rules are designed to reduce the risk of supporting the Chinese military, according to the U.S. government, Nvidia said in its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday. But it's unclear what prompted this specific policy move or what could drive future ones. In another positive sign for the chipmaker, the U.S. will allow Nvidia to continue developing its H100 artificial intelligence chip in China, the company said Thursday. \"The U.S. government has authorized exports, reexports, and in-country transfers needed to continue NVIDIA Corporation's, or the Company's, development of H100 integrated circuits,\" Nvidia said in a filing Thursday. The company said second-quarter revenue for its automotive business was $220 million, up 45% from a year earlier. \"Our automotive revenue is inflecting, and we expect it to be our next billion-dollar business,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in an earnings call in late August, according to a StreetAccount transcript. WeRide, an autonomous driving technology start-up, said in a statement that \"there is no immediate impact from the ban.\" \"We believe both the supply and demand side in the industry will work closely together to handle the constantly changing business environment to safeguard the continuous development of technology,\" the company said in a statement to CNBC. Pony.ai, another autonomous driving start-up, said it is not affected, as did automaker Geely. \u2014 CNBC's Kif Leswing contributed to this report."},

Some 220 solar panels and other equipment at the facility, known as FAT1, were damaged by the three-alarm fire, which was caused by \"an undetermined electrical event within the solar system mounted on top of the roof,\" Leland Wilding, Fresno's fire investigator, wrote in an incident report. A little over a year later, about 60 firefighters were called to an even larger Amazon facility in Perryville, Maryland, to put out a two-alarm blaze, local news outlets reported. In the intervening months, at least four other Amazon fulfillment centers caught fire or experienced electrical explosions due to failures with their solar energy-generating systems, according to internal company documents viewed by CNBC. The documents, which have never been made public, indicate that between April 2020 and June 2021, Amazon experienced \"critical fire or arc flash events\" in at least six of its 47 North American sites with solar installations, affecting 12.7% of such facilities. Arc flashes are a kind of electrical explosion. \"The rate of dangerous incidents is unacceptable, and above industry averages,\" an Amazon employee wrote in one of the internal reports. The solar snafus underscore the challenge Amazon and many other large corporations face in their quest to shrink their environmental footprint and reduce reliance on fossil fuels. Amazon has been among the most aggressive. In 2019, founder Jeff Bezos launched the Climate Pledge, promising the largest online retailer would zero out emissions by 2040, embrace renewable energy and move away from gas-guzzling delivery vans, including through a billion-dollar-plus investment in electric vehicle company Rivian. Corporate America is under pressure from regulators and a growing subset of investors to set and report on environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals. Many will be able to reap financial rewards for renewable energy efforts after Congress in August passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which includes climate provisions projected to reduce the country's carbon emissions by roughly 40% by 2030. Commercial solar in the U.S. is expected to see 8% annual growth over the next five years, thanks in part to the legislation, according to Wood Mackenzie solar analyst Michelle Davis. Warehouses can take outsized advantage of solar, she said, because they have large roofs and the systems can power all the HVAC, refrigeration and other energy-heavy systems located inside. But costly and dangerous issues can arise. By June of last year, all of Amazon's U.S. operations with solar had to be taken offline temporarily, internal documents show. The company had to ensure its systems were designed, installed and maintained properly before \"re-energizing\" any of them. Amazon spokesperson Erika Howard told CNBC in a statement that the incidents involved systems run by partners, and that the company responded by voluntarily turning off its solar-powered roofs. \"Out of an abundance of caution, following a small number of isolated incidents with onsite solar systems owned and operated by third parties, Amazon proactively powered off our onsite solar installations in North America, and took immediate steps to re-inspect each installation by a leading solar technical expert firm,\" the statement said. Those details didn't show up in Amazon's 100-page sustainability report for 2021, which was published at the beginning of August. In that report, available to the public via Amazon's sustainability website, the company said rooftop solar was powering 115 of its fulfillment centers across the globe by the end of 2021, up from more than 90 in the middle of the year. The majority of those are outside the U.S. \"Many of our fulfillment facilities throughout the U.S., Europe, and India are powered by on-site solar, where a rooftop installation can power up to 80% of the facility's energy use,\" the report said. By April of this year, Amazon had onsite solar at 176 facilities, according to its website. The solar program was launched in 2017. \"As inspections are completed, our onsite solar systems are being powered back on,\" Howard said. \"Amazon also built a team of dedicated solar experts overseeing the construction, operations, and maintenance of our systems in-house to ensure the safety of our systems.\" Excluded from the public sustainability report is any mention of the expenses Amazon incurs when there's a failure. An Amazon employee estimated, in the documents circulated internally, that each incident cost the company an average of $2.7 million. Costs included third-party audits of rooftop solar systems, checks on how much electricity they were generating and repairs for any broken or faulty parts of the systems that inspectors identified. The Amazon employee also said the company would lose $940,000 per month, or $20,000 for each of the 47 decommissioned North American sites, as long as the solar remained offline. There could be additional costs for Amazon depending on contracts with clean energy partners for renewable energy credits, the documents show. To date, Amazon has contracted with third-party vendors to design, then install solar photovoltaic systems on rooftops and big backup batteries on site. Other major retailers, including Walmart and Target, have also installed solar rooftops and adopted programs to trim their energy bills and reach sustainability goals. In addition to its warehouses, Amazon has some solar roof systems at its Whole Foods stores. Amazon and its auditor, Clean Energy Associates (CEA), put off inspection of the solar rooftop systems at Whole Foods locations until 2022, the documents said. As of late 2021, four years after acquiring Whole Foods, Amazon was still working to attain technical information about the renewable energy assets at the stores. To maintain tighter quality control of its solar energy systems, some Amazon employees recommended bringing more operations in-house. The fire in Perryville, Maryland, which was the sixth failure in a little over a year, spurred the company to take systematic action. On June 17, 2021, roughly a week after the fire at the warehouse known as MDT2, Amazon's sustainability division directed the owners and developers of solar rooftop systems on its U.S. warehouses to decommission them. The solar rooftops would no longer be generating electricity from the sun or producing renewable energy credits. Amazon then hired Denver-based CEA to conduct a third-party audit of its rooftop solar systems in the U.S., Asia-Pacific and Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Late last year, while CEA was still conducting its inspections, it informed Amazon of one critical and 259 major findings across Amazon's rooftop solar portfolio. Problems included mismatched module-to-module connectors, improper installation of connectors, poor wire management and evidence of water intrusion in the inverters, internal documents said. Issues with inverters, which convert solar energy into usable electricity, were identified as the likely cause of a fire in at least one Amazon warehouse. Wilding, the Fresno fire inspector, concluded the blaze at FAT1 \"originated on or near two inverters,\" according to an investigation report obtained by CNBC through a request for public records. Amazon blamed third-party partners and vendors for the most significant problems uncovered by CEA and other teams working on facilities and sustainability initiatives. \"Over the past five years, solar malfunctions have been caused by improper installation techniques, improper commissioning of a new system, inadequate system maintenance and equipment malfunction,\" the documents said. Amazon teams working on facilities and sustainability initiatives devised a two-part plan to help prevent future breakdowns in the rooftop solar program. In late 2021, the divisions requested $3.6 million in funding to reinspect sites where major findings were identified in order to ensure the systems were safe to be brought back online, according to internal correspondence. Internal teams also began to urge Amazon leadership to rely more on salaried employees and less on outside vendors. Over time, the company hired more solar experts focused on procurement, design, construction and maintenance globally. In some cases, management was notably slow in responding. For example, the groups inside the company agitating for change went to leadership for approval on the hiring, re-inspection and re-energizing plans. But the efforts were held up for months by top Amazon executives, including Kara Hurst, vice president of worldwide sustainability, and Alicia Boler-Davis, senior vice president of global customer fulfillment, who left the company in June 2022, according to internal correspondence viewed by CNBC. Amazon disputed the claim in the documents that leadership was slow to address employee requests. Job openings suggest Amazon is still seeking to hire people internally for solar operations. The company was recently looking for someone to manage sustainability projects across its North American facilities, which include rooftop solar. There's a current listing for a technical program partner on the solar team says that a key aspect of the position is collaborating with \"internal partners\" in worldwide design, solar construction and sustainability, among other divisions. As it tries to staff up, Amazon has acknowledged that going green comes with hurdles, particularly for a company \"of the size and broad scope of Amazon.\" \"But at Amazon, we don't shy away from big challenges,\" Hurst wrote, in the letter kicking off the 2021 sustainability report. \"We don't have all the answers today, but we believe in the need to act now.\" WATCH: How two friends formed Amazon's first U.S. union and what's next"},

On Friday, the company launched the mid-range Honor 70 smartphone in Europe and said an unannounced foldable phone will be coming to the region and other international markets too in the future. It will be the first time Honor launches a foldable device overseas, the company said. Honor faces an uphill battle outside of China where it has less than a 1% smartphone market share. The brand was sold by Huawei to a consortium of Chinese buyers in late 2020 as a way to survive U.S. sanctions. In 2019 and 2020, Huawei was hit by a number of American sanctions that cut its access to Google software and key chips, destroying its smartphone business. Since then, Honor has launched a number of smartphones. This year, it brought its flagship Magic 4 handset to international markets. Alongside the upcoming foldable phone, Honor is placing emphasis on the more expensive premium end of the smartphone market outside of China. That will put Honor in competition with Samsung's latest foldables \u2014 the Galaxy Z Flip 4 and Galaxy Z Fold 4. \"As the global economy has deteriorated in 2022, the premium end has remained strong, benefitting Samsung and Apple so far this year,\" James Manning Smith, senior analyst at CCS Insight, told CNBC via email. \"One of Honor's greatest challenges in the year will be trying to leverage this trend, attempting to win sales from well-established premium brands, particularly in a year where stretched budgets will result in consumers looking to avoid potentially more risky purchases.\" Shipments of phones costing over $1,000 grew 94% year-on-year in the second quarter, according to Counterpoint Research. This segment is dominated by Apple and Samsung. But Honor's Chinese rivals including Xiaomi, Oppo and Realme have also managed to gain share overseas by managing to pump out mid-priced devices with high specs. That will pose another challenge to Honor. Honor's \"low-cost Chinese peers have made some serious in-roads in the European market over the last two years, a position that they will not give up without a fight,\" Smith added. \"Although Honor has been ramping up its marketing, it faces some incredibly fierce competition outside of China.\""},

From 1991 to 2000, global insured losses from floods was about $30 billion. In the next decade, global insured losses from floods was $40 billion, and from 2011 to 2020, global insured losses from floods was $80 billion, according to Swiss Re. In the first year of the next decade alone, 2021, insured losses were $20 billion, Swiss Re said. That's only a fraction of the total losses from flooding. In the decade from 2011 to 2020, 82 percent of global economic losses from floods was uninsured, according to Swiss Re. Population growth, the growth of cities, and the increasing intensity of flooding events due to climate change are to blame for the surge in the damage done by floods. \"Climate change is increasing likelihood of high-intensity, heavy rain and short-duration floods events associated with tropical cyclones,\" the report from Swiss Re said. Currently, Pakistan is struggling to recover from deadly floods that have killed more than 1,000 people and injured many more, according to Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the Secretary-General of the United Nations. \"Pakistan is awash in suffering. The Pakistani people are facing a monsoon on steroids \u2014 the relentless impact of epochal levels of rain and flooding,\" Guterres said on Monday. \"As we continue to see more and more extreme weather events around the world, it is outrageous that climate action is being put on the back burner as global emissions of greenhouse gases are still rising, putting all of us \u2013 everywhere \u2013 in growing danger,\" Guterres said. In the United States, almost 40% of the population lives in coastal counties and another 10% in floodplains. \"Despite the private flood insurance market gaining traction over the last few years, too many people are still not covered for flooding and the majority of those impacted by these events are uninsured, leaving them to pick up the pieces at their own expense,\" Keith Wolfe, president of property and casualty for Swiss Re in the US, said in a written statement. Extreme rainfall can cause flooding anywhere, said Swiss Re. \"Flood risk is in a lot more places than your mortgage company tells you,\" Wolfe said. For the insurance industry, the ability to properly insure properties for flooding risk is improving due to better date and more granular risk mapping, Swiss Re said. It's still not perfect, though. The accuracy for measuring flood risk has improved but it still \"remains limited,\" the report said. ."},

It's a win for the company after it warned Wednesday that new export restrictions could hamper its operations in the country. Nvidia said in an SEC filing Wednesday that the U.S. government is restricting sales of high-performance AI chips for servers, the A100 and H100, to China and Russia. Sales of both chips are still restricted in those markets, though it can still develop the H100 in China. Nvidia expects a $400 million hit to revenue in the current quarter from new export restrictions. The company's stock fell nearly 9% in trading Thursday. \"The U.S. government has authorized exports, reexports, and in-country transfers needed to continue NVIDIA Corporation's, or the Company's, development of H100 integrated circuits,\" Nvidia said in a filing Thursday. The Biden administration is working to limit U.S. exports of certain semiconductors and equipment because of fears that Chinese companies could use them for military purposes. Graphics processors like the kind that Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices make are well suited for artificial intelligence applications that could include weapons development, facial recognition and other military uses. The H100 is Nvidia's upcoming enterprise AI chip that was previously expected to ship by the end of the year. Part of its development takes place in China. The A100 is an older model that has been shipping for three years. They are both graphics processors that can be used for supercomputing and artificial intelligence. Nvidia's data center business, which includes sales of the A100 and H100, is one of the fastest-growing parts of the company, reporting $3.8 billion in sales in the June quarter, a 61% annual increase. However, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang warned analysts in August that Chinese cloud companies were slowing down building out their data centers and that China was a \"very large market\" for the company. Nvidia said Thursday that it can continue to ship AI chips from its Hong Kong facility through September 2023. \"The Chinese hyperscalers and the Chinese Internet companies really, really slowed down infrastructure investment this year, particularly starting in -- they've been rather slow in building out and really accelerate -- well, really slowed down in Q2,\" Huang said. Some analysts believe that Nvidia can ameliorate the impact of the new export restrictions by working with the government, although it's unclear whether the Chinese government might retaliate with its own bans. \"While there are potential near and intermediate term risks from the export ban, Nvidia is working closely with the [U.S. government] to navigate through the situation and we believe the USG is fully aware of the critical/strategic importance of Nvidia's accelerated compute platform to the global tech industry,\" JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur wrote in a note Thursday. The Department of Commerce said the new export restrictions are related to national security, but it didn't answer follow-up questions about whether it clarified or changed the policy for Nvidia. \"While we are not in a position to outline specific policy changes at this time, we are taking a comprehensive approach to implement additional actions necessary related to technologies, end-uses, and end-users to protect U.S. national security and foreign policy interests,\" a Department of Commerce representative said Wednesday.

And while some may still owe state taxes, it may be fewer borrowers than expected. It depends on whether and when states conform to federal tax laws, including the American Rescue Plan of 2021 provision making student loan forgiveness federally tax-free through 2025. While the Tax Foundation initially estimated that 13 states may tax student loan forgiveness, the organization has revised projections over the past week as states provided updates. It now projects five states \u2014 Arkansas, Minnesota, Mississippi, North Carolina and Wisconsin \u2014 may tax student loan forgiveness. While taxing forgiveness isn't likely in Massachusetts, the state hasn't officially made a determination. More from Personal Finance:\nWhat Biden's student loan forgiveness means for your taxes\nDo you make too much for student loan forgiveness?\nStudent loan forgiveness applications could open within weeks \"No one wants to be the state taxing student loan forgiveness,\" said Ethan Miller, a certified financial planner and founder of Planning for Progress, specializing in student loans in the Washington, D.C., area. He said the latest updates may be helpful since borrowers aren't receiving extra income to cover potential state liability, he said. \"I expect we'll see at least a few more clarify their position,\" Miller added. Of course, with policies in flux, there's still time for changes. Currently, here's which states may tax student loan forgiveness. Although the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration hasn't issued a formal decision, a determination may arrive in the coming days, a spokesperson told CNBC. However, the state doesn't conform to the federal code \"in any significant way,\" according to the Tax Foundation, making forgiven student debt likely to be taxable without state action. While the Massachusetts Department of Revenue hasn't made a final determination, state Rep. Steve Owens, a Democrat, on Wednesday said in a tweet that student loan forgiveness won't be taxable. What's more, the state has already issued guidance on conforming to the American Rescue Plan's exclusion, Owens said in a separate tweet. A state provision to conform with the American Rescue Plan Act's exemption was not approved during the last session of the state legislature, a spokesperson for the Minnesota Department of Revenue told CNBC. \"If the state does not conform to this federal law, then Minnesota taxpayers who have their student debt discharged will have to add back this amount for Minnesota income tax purposes,\" the spokesperson said. The Mississippi Department of Revenue has confirmed with CNBC that student loan forgiveness will be taxable at the state level. Student loan forgiveness is \"currently considered taxable income,\" according to a press release on Wednesday from the North Carolina Department of Revenue. However, the department is monitoring legislation changes from the state's General Assembly. With the state tax law conforming before the American Rescue Plan Act, it's possible Wisconsin may tax student loan forgiveness, according to the Tax Foundation. The Wisconsin Department of Revenue hadn't responded to a request for comment by press time."},

The crash on June 3 i nvolved a Cruise vehicle, which does not require a human driver, braking harshly while making an unprotected left turn as an oncoming vehicle traveling about 40 mph \u2014 15 mph above the speed limit \u2014 switched from a right-turn lane to travel through the intersection. In public filings, federal regulators said the recalled software may \"incorrectly predict another vehicle's path or be insufficiently reactive to the sudden path change of a road user.\" Cruise said a software update in July was conducted to address the problem. Following the crash, Cruise said its robotaxi fleet continued to operate but that it temporarily prevented the vehicles from making unprotected left turns. It said it gradually reintroduced unprotected left turns after the software update. The crash was especially notable because it occurred a day after California regulators granted Cruise permission to commercialize its robotaxi fleet. It also happened amid increased scrutiny by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, part of the Department of Transportation, involving such vehicles and advanced driver-assist systems. Commercializing autonomous vehicles has been far more challenging than many predicted even a few years ago. The challenges have led to a consolidation in the autonomous vehicle sector after years of enthusiasm touting the technology as the next multitrillion-dollar market for transportation companies. In June, Cruise became the first company to offer unmanned fared rides to the public in a major city. The company for several years had been testing the vehicles, which are modified Chevrolet Bolt EVs, and was offering limited, non-fared rides to the public before then. The June crash was the only such incident in more than 123,560 driverless unprotected left turns prior to the software update, according to Cruise. The report also noted that law enforcement found the \"party at most fault\" for the collision was the other vehicle, according to the filings. When the crash occurred, the Cruise vehicle \"had to decide between two different risk scenarios and chose the one with the least potential for a serious collision at the time, before the oncoming vehicle's sudden change of direction,\" according to Cruise. In July, NHTSA said it was investigating the incident, with the assistance of Cruise, a majority-owned subsidiary of GM."},

Here are the August delivery numbers for the three companies: Nio was the only company to grow on a monthly basis in August but U.S.-listed shares of the EV start-up closed over 5% lower. Li Auto shares fell 3% while Xpeng was slumped more than 6%. In Friday morning trade, Hong Kong-listed shares of Nio and Li Auto slipped 0.6% and 0.3%, respectively. Xpeng shares in the city fell 2%. The Chinese economy is facing a number of challenges including a resurgence of Covid-19 that has seen major cities like Shanghai locked down. In the last few days Shenzhen, China's tech hub has enacted Covid restrictions and on Thursday, the mega city of Chengdu went into lockdown. While some cities may have opened up again, consumer sentiment remains fragile and uncertainty prevails as a result of China's \"zero-Covid\" policy. The world's second-largest economy is also facing a power crunch which is impacting electric vehicle charging stations. Last month, Tesla and Nio suspended some of their charging services. These issues are filtering through to EV sales. Bill Russo, CEO at Shanghai-based Automobility, told CNBC, the numbers are \"reflective of lingering supply chain issues as well as the fact that they're on the premium end of the price range and with the weakening economy, people are looking toward affordability and that's squeezing some of the higher priced models.\" Last month, Xpeng said it expects to deliver between 29,000 and 31,000 electric vehicles in the third quarter of the year. This guidance disappointed investors. Xpeng President Brian Gu said the guidance reflects the fact that the industry is entering a \"relatively slow season\" and that traffic in stores is less due to the Covid situation. Yanan Shen, president of Li Auto, said in an earnings call last month that the Covid outbreak \"severely affected\" the company's supply chains and that there are remaining \"disruptions and difficulties.\" Shen also said there had been a slowdown in order intake for its flagship Li One sports utility vehicle. Li Auto began to deliver its new L9 car to customers at the end of August. And the company said it is planning to launch and deliver a large SUV called the Li L8 in early November. That could be affecting sales of its Li One, according to Russo. \"Li has major new product launches with the L9 and L8 which is also impacting consumer demand for Li One. When new products come out, demand for the older model often suffers,\" Russo said. To spur demand, China said last month it would extend its tax exemption for new energy vehicle purchases until the end of 2023. Competition continues to heat up in China's electric vehicle market. Alongside Li Auto's new cars, Xpeng plans to begin deliveries of its new G9 SUV in October and launch two new vehicles next year."},

The move sees the former NASA chief throw his experience and reputation behind a startup with a unique propellant technology. Bridenstine has joined up with larger, established organizations since leaving the space agency. Bridenstine served at NASA during former President Donald Trump's administration, and now holds a variety of roles within the space industry \u2013 including as senior advisor to private equity group Acorn Growth, and on the boards of Viasat and The Aerospace Corp. El Segundo, California-based Phase Four builds next-generation electric thrusters for small satellites, with six operating in orbit so far. The company has raised about $30 million in funding since its founding in 2015. Bridenstine told CNBC that Phase Four's approach of using radio frequency to utilize a wide variety of propellant types \u2013 including xenon, krypton, iodine and water \u2013 is \"going to be an absolute game changer for these proliferated [low Earth orbit satellite] constellations.\" Phase Four's propellant flexibility gives the company stability in the face of a geopolitical threat, Bridenstine said. Noble gases xenon and krypton \u2014 often used as spacecraft propellants \u2014 are \"not widely available\" and largely produced in Russia, Ukraine and China. \"The idea that we can get away from those traditional fuels and get into things like iodine and water, I think [should] significantly drop costs and create an environment where you don't have as many opportunities for disruption,\" Bridenstine said. That supply chain threat is also a focus of the Pentagon's work in space. \"I think the Space Force is very interested in making sure that that we do have consistent supply chains that are not at risk, and we don't have to be spending money with countries that aren't friendly with us,\" Bridenstine added. Phase Four has contracts to develop and produce thrusters from the Air Force and DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, as well as commercial orders from companies like Capella Space. The company has 32 employees and is expanding into a 23,000-square-foot facility in Hawthorne, California. It plans to raise another funding round in 2023 and to grow to about 50 people over the next 12 months. CEO Beau Jarvis told CNBC that his relationship with Bridenstine dates back to when Jarvis was a vice president at satellite imagery company Planet and the latter was a congressman. At the time, Bridenstine was \"trying to make it easier for small space companies to be able to work with the Department of Defense, or more broadly, the U.S. government,\" Jarvis said. \"Seeing some of what Jim has talked about more recently, in terms of having more sustainable space operations, and the potential for debris issues in space ... there's a lot of overlap [between] Jim's vision and our vision,\" Jarvis said."},

And a lot of people still don't get it,\" Cramer said.

But that didn't stop the state of Mississippi from paying Favre $1.1 million in 2017 and 2018 to make motivational speeches \u2014 out of federal welfare funds intended for needy families. The Mississippi state auditor said Favre never gave the speeches and demanded the money back, with interest. Favre has repaid the fees, although not the $228,000 in interest the auditor also demanded. But the revelation by the auditor that $70 million in TANF welfare funds was doled out to a multimillionaire athlete, a professional wrestler, a horse farm and a volleyball complex are at the heart of a scandal that has rocked the nation's poorest state, sparking parallel state and federal criminal investigations that have led to charges and guilty pleas involving some of the key players. Favre hasn't been accused of a crime or charged, and he declined an interview. His lawyer, Bud Holmes, said he did nothing wrong and never understood he was paid with money intended to help poor children. Holmes acknowledged that Favre had been questioned by the FBI in the case, a fact that hasn't previously been reported. The saga, which has been boiling at low grade for 2\u00bd years, drew new attention in July, when the state welfare agency fired a lawyer who had been hired to claw back some of the money, just after he issued a subpoena seeking more information about the roles of Favre and the former governor, Phil Bryant, a Republican. The current governor, Republican Tate Reeves, acknowledged playing a role in the decision to sack Brad Pigott, accusing the former Bill Clinton-appointed U.S. attorney of having a political agenda. But the state official who first uncovered the misspending and fraud, auditor Shad White, is a Republican. In his first television interview since he was fired, Pigott said his only agenda was to get at the truth and to recoup U.S. taxpayer funds sent to Mississippi that he says were \"squandered.\" \"The notion of tens of millions of dollars that was intended by the country to go to the alleviation of poverty \u2014 and to see it going toward very different purposes \u2014 was appalling to many of us,\" he said. \"Mr. Favre was a very great quarterback, but having been a great NFL quarterback, he is not well acquainted with poverty.\" Pigott, who before he was fired sued on behalf of Mississippi's welfare agency, naming Favre and 37 other grant recipients, laid ultimate blame at the feet of top Mississippi politicians, including Bryant. \"Governor Bryant gave tens of millions of dollars of this TANF welfare money to a nonprofit led by a person who he knew well and who had more connections with his political party than with the good people in Mississippi who have the heart and the skills to actually cajole people out of poverty or prevent teenage pregnancies,\" he said. In an interview with Mississippi Today, Bryant said he never knew the grants came from welfare money. His lawyer didn't respond to requests for comment. The person in charge of the nonprofit group Pigott was referring to is Nancy New, a close friend of Bryant's wife. New and her son have pleaded guilty to state and federal charges and agreed to cooperate. New, a key player in doling out the money, said in a court document that Bryant was among those involved in directing the transactions. Her lawyer declined to comment. The former head of the state welfare agency, John Davis, has pleaded not guilty to state charges of bribery and conspiracy, and law enforcement officials say the investigations continue. Favre defended himself in a series of tweets last year against charges from state auditor White that he accepted state money for speeches he never intended to give. \"I would never knowingly take funds meant to help our neighbors in need, but for Shad White to continue to push out this lie that the money was for no-show events is something I cannot stay silent about,\" Favre tweeted. The speeches aren't the only welfare grants tied to Favre. Text messages obtained by the website Mississippi Today and authenticated by Pigott show that Favre sought a $3.2 million grant to a drug company in which he was a shareholder and a $5 million award that built a volleyball arena at the University of Southern Mississippi, where his daughter played the sport and where he played football. Favre's lawyer declined to comment. The drug company, Prevacus, was touting treatments to mitigate the effects of concussions, although none were approved by the Food and Drug Administration. In some texts, Favre suggested awarding shares in the drug company to Bryant while he was governor. \"Don't know if legal or not but we need cut him in,\" Favre texted a company official in November 2018, referring to Bryant. Following up three days later, Favre wrote, \"Also if legal I'll give some of my shares to the Governor.\" Bryant has said he never would have accepted such an offer. \"All of it remains quite a mystery,\" Pigott told NBC News, \"as to why Mr. Favre would get the benefit of millions of dollars in TANF welfare money, both for a fee for speeches he didn't make, $2 million-plus to go to a company in which he was the largest outside individual investor and $5 million for his alma mater to play volleyball in a volleyball building.\" The state auditor said he found other \"no show\" contracts benefiting former pro athletes and family members of Davis, the welfare agency director. The auditor said Davis directed one contract to Austin Smith, his nephew, who was paid more than $400,000 to provide \"coding skills\" classes even though prosecutors allege he had no such skills \"and did not know how to teach.\" At least $3 million went to Ted DiBiase, a retired professional wrestler. Marcus Dupree, a former college football star, also received $370,000 in welfare funds, which prosecutors say partly went to fund his horse ranch. Paul LaCoste, who is the current governor's athletic trainer, was paid $300,000 in welfare funds to run a fitness boot camp for legislators. DiBiase, Dupree, LaCoste and Smith didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. The scandal has also spotlighted the meager scope of Mississippi's welfare program and provided a stark reminder of the Clinton-era welfare reform that provided states with block grants and wide latitude in how they spend it. According to state figures, Mississippi rejects more than 90% of those who apply for the federal welfare benefit known as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF. This year 2,500 children received benefits, state officials said, in a state with 192,000 poor children. One of those who had trouble getting help was Tamara Edwards, who raised four children on her own while working a series of low-wage jobs. She once received welfare vouchers for child care, and in 2009 she applied again, she said. Even though her income was low enough, she was denied. \"They told me they didn't have the funds,\" said Edwards, who now works as a cook at a Cracker Barrel restaurant. Advocates and state legislators say Mississippi's welfare agency, under years of conservative Republican state governments, has a history of questionable spending and a lack of transparency. \"TANF has been a slush fund for a long time,\" said Oleta Fitzgerald, who is the director of the Children's Defense Fund's Southern Regional Office and is based in Jackson, the state capital. \"Mississippi is the poorest doggone state in the country \u2014 where is the money, and what are they doing with it? There is nobody on welfare \u2014 welfare participation rates are way down \u2014 and no one knows where that money is being spent.\" Aisha Nyandoro, the chief executive of Springboard to Opportunities, a local nonprofit group that works with residents of affordable housing, said: \"And DHS [the state Department of Human Services] will tell you that the reason that they cannot go about allocating the TANF funds is because they can't find any families who are eligible. Go outside and throw a rock. It's Mississippi.

Already reeling from an economic crisis, flood waters have submerged over one third of the country in water, killing over 1,000 and impacting 33 million people. Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, the country's foreign minister, told CNBC's Dan Murphy Thursday that he fears the damages from the natural disaster will exceed current estimates of $10 billion, adding that the crisis in the country is still ongoing and in the \"rescue and relief phase.\" The flooding, which Bhutto Zardari told CNBC is \"a climate disaster of biblical proportions,\" covers over 95,000 square miles of land. Bhutto Zardari said the crisis is far from over, as \"southern areas of Pakistan are still bracing themselves for the flooding to come through the rivers from the north.\" \"Pakistan at this point in time, are paying in their lives and in their livelihoods for a climate disaster that is not of their making,\" he said. Pakistan's contribution to global carbon emissions is less than 1%, but it's among the 10 most affected countries in the world by climate change. The South Asian nation of over 220 million people reported a 27% inflation rate for August, according to government data, and was hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic. Its currency has tanked while net foreign reserves have dwindled to just $8 billion in August, according to the State Bank of Pakistan. Political infighting has gripped the country since April, after the ousting of former Prime Minister Imran Khan, who has been charged under anti-terror laws by Pakistan's police. Rural areas in Pakistan have been hit the hardest by flooding, which will have a compounded impact on Pakistan's farming industry, and ultimately the cost of food. Bhutto Zardari told CNBC \"about 80 to 90%\" of Pakistan's crops have been damaged by the floods. The International Rescue Committee report that 4 million acres of crops have been destroyed with 800,000 livestock perishing. Prior to the disaster, food inflation in rural provinces was much higher compared to urban areas. For instance, the cost of onions in Pakistan's urban areas increased by 89% from July 2021 to July 2022. In rural areas, that cost increase topped 100%. The International Monetary Fund on Monday approved the release of $1.1 billion to Pakistan in special drawing rights, a part of its bailout program which began in 2019. The money was already part of a relief program to help Pakistan stabilize its economy. Pakistan has now launched a joint appeal with the United Nations for about $160 million, which Bhutto Zardari told CNBC \"is obviously a very conservative estimate about the bare minimum requirements at this moment.\" Over a million homes have been destroyed, and Bhutto Zardari added that key infrastructure like bridges, road networks, and dams have been damaged. Pakistan going forward, he says, will need \"large scale reconstruction, which will require a lot of work.\""},

Investors are looking for clues as to just how aggressive the Federal Reserve could be later this month, when the central bank is widely expected to raise rates again in its fight against inflation.

Starbucks has chosen its next chief executive officer: Laxman Narasimhan, who just resigned as CEO of Reckitt, which owns Lysol cleaning brands, Durex condoms and more. Yet Howard Schultz, who has been the coffee chain's interim CEO since April, isn't going anywhere anytime soon. Narasimhan will join Starbucks in October, but won't take over as the company's chief until April. Schultz will also remain on the company's board and continue to be an advisor after Narasimhan, also a PepsiCo veteran, assumes the role. More details are on the way at Starbucks' investor day, which is slated for Sept. 13 in Seattle. The National Labor Relations Board said Thursday that the Amazon Labor Union's winning effort to unionize a Staten Island, New York, warehouse should be upheld. The e-commerce giant began its formal objection in May, the month after the union won. But the NLRB attorney overseeing the case said Amazon\"had not met its burden\" in its bid to demonstrate that the union used objectionable means to secure its victory. The grassroots Amazon Labor Union, meanwhile, is looking to expand its influence. It failed to unionize another Staten Island warehouse in May, but workers at warehouses in Albany, New York, and Kentucky are seeking to organize with the union.

During an interview at the Ambrosetti Forum in Italy it was put to Starace that, in some people's view, oil and gas would be key for energy over the next 25 years, a contention he disputed. \"I totally disagree, because this is a view that is coming from, say, 15 years ago,\" he said. \"Was that wrong at that time? No, it was not. Now it's wrong.\" \"The economy can work much better, relying much less on fossil fuels, than people think,\" he went on to add. \"It will take maybe another two years before everybody understands that \u2014 but we are there.\" Despite this optimism about the future, today's reality on the ground is hugely challenging. The current situation in Europe, where many countries are attempting to wean themselves off Russian energy following the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine, illustrates the crucial role fossil fuels still play in society. With colder months closing in, European nations have been looking to shore up gas storage in a bid to ensure security of supply. Looking ahead, Enel's Starace expressed confidence Europe had prepared for the coming winter. \"Insofar as storage is concerned, Europe \u2026 did the right thing,\" he said, noting that most countries were \"pretty full.\" \"Now, the question is what happens if gas is cut altogether from Russia,\" Starace went on to state. \"Well, we're almost there, the cut is actually almost there.\" \"We have a view, and there are many studies showing that with some sacrifices, [such as] two notches of temperature down, and a little bit of attention to gas consumptions \u2026 Europe can make it through the wintertime.\" \"The question is when we get to the spring [of] 2023 with totally depleted, really, reserves, and gas is still not flowing,\" he said. \"Is Europe able to re-establish the storage, with all the backup of floating regasifiers and energy coming from other parts of the world? I think that's going to be the big challenge.\" The Enel Group \u2014 whose main shareholder is the Italian Ministry of Economy and Finance \u2014 has said it will abandon gas generation by 2040. It also plans to leave the retail gas market in 2040. Starace's comments came on the same day that the EU's climate chief, Frans Timmermans, hammered home the urgency of the situation facing European economies in the face of rising energy prices and concerns about supply. \"We need to do everything we can to face this energy crisis and to make sure that we do everything we can to reduce the prices so that our citizens can still afford to heat their homes this winter,\" Timmermans, who was speaking to CNBC's Silvia Amaro at an event in Bali, Indonesia, said. He also stressed the importance of member states being \"in a position to address the issue of windfall profits, if necessary.\" \"So we'll try everything to make sure that our energy markets are functioning, and are functioning in a way that addresses the issues that we need to tackle.\" Timmermans was asked if \"doing everything\" meant the EU agreeing, in the short term, to imposing caps on the price of gas and electricity. \"Well, nothing's off the table right now,\" he replied. \"We're preparing all of that, but we have to make sure that what we do doesn't create more damage than it helps us address the issue.\" \"So we have to be extremely careful. It took us 30 years to build the energy markets, so we need to make sure we address today's issue without creating long term problems.\""},

This week, pet products retailer Chewy said it's not seeing any significant trade down among shoppers in pet food. Rival pet retailer Petco made similar remarks last week, though both noted a pullback in spending on products such as leashes and toys. The comments are in line with the trend of pet owners increasingly spoiling their cats and dogs with foods that are more like the dishes they'd feed themselves or other family members. To capitalize on the ongoing shift, Petco recently partnered with snack bar maker Clif to sell a version for pets. It also launched a line of frozen, human-grade meals for dogs. \"Pet parents are driving one of the biggest trends the pet industry has seen as they increasingly seek out fresh, human-grade food for all members of the family,\" Petco CEO Ron Coughlin said in a release. Coughlin said the growing \"humanization\" of animal companions is being led by Gen Z and Millennial consumers who are \"hyper focused\" on their pets' health and wellness. In addition to more premium foods, Chewy and Petco see their health products and services as a way to better compete with the low-price offerings from retailers such as Amazon and Walmart. Earlier this month, Chewy expanded its health offerings with CarePlus, a line of pet wellness and insurance offerings. For its second quarter, Chewy said net sales rose 12.8% from a year ago to $2.43 billion as shoppers shifted toward more fresh and premium food products. Petco said its sales rose 3.2% to $1.48 billion and reported a similar shift. Still, the pet category isn't shielded from the soaring inflation that's pressuring consumers. Both Petco and Chewy reported softening demand in products such as crates, beds, leashes and toys over the summer months. Chewy noted that such items don't have to be replaced as often as some other items, and that shoppers are opting to skip on them as prices rise. Chewy said the downturn in such products is temporary and that it expects demand will recover. Brian LaRose, Petco's chief financial officer, also said orders for the products \"are delayed, not canceled.\" Still, both companies tightened their full-year guidance, in part because of the softened demand. Both companies lowered their revenue guidance for the year. Petco said it now expects adjusted earnings per share of 77 to 81 cents. It previously forecast 97 cents to $1. Petco's shares are down down around 24% year to date, while Chewy's stock is down around 41%."},

The company also raised its outlook for the year. Shares rose about 9% in off-hours trading. Here's what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by Refinitiv: Same store sales grew 23%, which beat StreetAccount's estimate of 17.6%. Net sales rose 29% to $1.87 billion. The company said that traffic remains strong both in stores and online, even as surging inflation cramps consumers' spending. Lululemon has a higher-income customer base that seems mostly unfettered by inflationary pressures. Still, other higher-end retailers like Nordstrom and Macy's slashed their outlook this quarter on fears of slowing demand. Lululemon, on the other hand, has boosted its guidance in two consecutive quarters. \"Despite the challenges around us in the macro-environment, guest traffic in our stores and on our e-commerce sites remains robust, which speaks to the strength of our multi-dimensional operating model,\" Chief Financial Officer Meghan Frank said in a news release. Store traffic increased over 30%, and ecommerce traffic rose over 40%, executives said on the earnings call Thursday. The company is hoping to boost customer loyalty with a soon-to-launch membership program. The membership program was announced at the end of the first quarter. It has a free tier and a $39 per month paid tier which give subscribers early access to product drops and exclusive items, as well as invitations to in-person events. The company said the traffic increases were not attributable to promotional programs or product markdowns. \"We have not changed our promotional cadence,\" CEO Calvin McDonald said on the earnings call. \"We have no plans to do so.\" Lululemon continued brick-and-mortar expansion during the quarter, with 21 net new stores for a total of 600 locations. Inventories were up 85% to $1.5 billion compared to the same period last year, but the company said it was \"under-inventoried\" at the time due to supply chain bottlenecks. Retailers in general have had to contend with swelling inventory levels as shoppers adjust their spending habits. Lululemon said Thursday it is confident the inventory level will help it boost sales during the holiday shopping season. The company said it now expects 2022 revenue of between $7.865 billion and $7.940 billion, up from the range of $7.610 billion to $7.710 billion it stated last quarter. The company also raised its adjusted earnings per share outlook to a range of $9.75 to $9.90, from last quarter's guidance of $9.35 to $9.50 adjusted. The release also maintained the company's long-term outlook of doubling net revenue to $12.5 billion from from 2021 to 2026. The plan includes an expansion of its menswear business, footwear, and membership-based fitness classes. Upon the plan's announcement in the spring, some analysts were skeptical about Lululemon's ability to achieve the lofty longer-term target. Lululemon touted some early success with the plan. It launched new shoes during the quarter, while its men's business saw 27% growth. The company also reported growth across all of the countries in which stores are currently active.

Speaking to CNBC at the Ambrosetti Forum in Italy, Ferguson said the catalyst events had already occurred to spark a repeat of the 70s, a period characterized by financial shocks, political clashes and civil unrest. Yet this time, the severity of those shocks was likely to be greater and more sustained. \"The ingredients of the 1970s are already in place,\" Ferguson, Milbank Family Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University, told CNBC's Steve Sedgwick. \"The monetary and fiscal policy mistakes of last year, which set this inflation off, are very alike to the 60s,\" he said, likening recent price hikes to the 1970's doggedly high inflation. \"And, as in 1973, you get a war,\" he continued, referring to the 1973 Arab-Israeli War \u2014 also known as the Yom Kippur War \u2014 between Israel and a coalition of Arab states led by Egypt and Syria. As with Russia's current war in Ukraine, the 1973 Arab-Israeli War led to international involvement from then-superpowers the Soviet Union and the U.S., sparking a wider energy crisis. Only that time, the conflict lasted just 20 days. Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine has now entered into its sixth month, suggesting that any repercussions for energy markets could be far worse. \"This war is lasting much longer than the 1973 war, so the energy shock it is causing is actually going to be more sustained,\" said Ferguson. Politicians and central bankers have been vying to mitigate the worst effects of the fallout, by raising interest rates to combat inflation and reducing reliance on Russian energy imports. But Ferguson, who has authored 16 books, including his most recent \"Doom: The Politics of Catastrophe,\" said there was no evidence to suggest that current crises could be avoided. \"Why shouldn't it be as bad as the 1970s?\" he said. \"I'm going to go out on a limb: Let's consider the possibility that the 2020s could actually be worse than the 1970s.\" Among the reasons for that, he said, were currently lower productivity growth, higher debt levels and less favorable demographics now versus 50 years ago. \"At least in the 1970s you had detente between superpowers. I don't see much detente between Washington and Beijing right now. In fact, I see the opposite,\" he said, referring to recent clashes over Taiwan. Humans like to believe that global shocks happen with some degree of order or predictability. But that, Ferguson said, is a fallacy. In fact, rather than being evenly spread throughout history, like a bell curve, disasters tend to happen non-linearly and all at once, he said. \"The distributions in history really aren't normal, particularly when it comes to things like wars and financial crises or, for that matter, pandemics,\" said Ferguson. \"You start with a plague \u2014 or something we don't see very often, a really large global pandemic \u2014 which kills millions of people and disrupts the economy in all kinds of ways. Then you hit it with a big monetary and fiscal policy shock. And then you add the geopolitical shock.\" That miscalculation leads humans to be overly optimistic and, ultimately, unprepared to handle major crises, he said. \"In their heads, the world is kind of a bunch of averages, and there aren't likely to be really bad outcomes. This leads people ... to be somewhat overoptimistic,\" he said. As an example, Ferguson said he surveyed attendees at Ambrosetti \u2014 a forum in Italy attended by political leaders and the business elite \u2014 and found low single-digit percentages expect to see a decline in investment in Italy over the coming months. \"This is a country that's heading towards a recession,\" he said."},

All of Buick's roughly 2,000 U.S. franchise dealers will be given the opportunity to take a buyout, Duncan Aldred, global head of Buick, told The Wall Street Journal. \"Not everyone necessarily wants to make that journey, depending on where they're located or the level of expenditure that the transition will demand,\" he told the publication. \"So if they want to exit the Buick franchise, then we will give them monetary assistance to do so.\" Michelle Malcho, a company spokeswoman, on Friday confirmed the buyout plans to CNBC but declined to disclose the expected cost or how many dealers GM anticipates will take the offer. Many Buick dealers also sell GMC vehicles or another one of GM's U.S. brands. The company offered similar buyouts to Cadillac dealers in 2020. About 150, or 17%, of those 880 retailers accepted the offer rather than assume expectations to invest at least $200,000 toward upgrading dealerships for electric vehicles. Buyout offers for Cadillac dealers ranged from about $300,000 to more than $1 million, a person familiar with the plans previously told CNBC. Malcho declined to disclose how much Buick dealers would be offered. Buick's EV plans are part of a broader $30 billion investment by GM into electric vehicles by 2025.

The city's Department of Consumer and Worker Protection said the case marks its first lawsuit for a violation of New York City's \"just cause\" protections for fast-food workers. Austin Locke, a longtime barista and union organizer, was fired less than a month after he and his coworkers voted to unionize a Starbucks in Queens, according to the lawsuit. The store is one of dozens of Starbucks locations that have voted to unionize. Starbucks had said that Locke was fired for failing to fill out a Covid-19 questionnaire and falsely reporting that a supervisor made physical contact with him, according to the city's lawsuit. The missteps were reportedly confirmed by surveillance footage, but the suit states that Locke's district and store manager did not let him see that footage. Locke's shifts were canceled, and he filed a complaint to the city days later. \"We do not comment on pending litigation,\" a Starbucks representative wrote to CNBC. \"However, we do intend to defend against the alleged violations of the New York City Just Cause Law.\" Under the city's Fair Workweek law, it is illegal to fire workers who have completed a 30 day probation or reduce their hours by more than 15% without just cause or an economic justification. The city is suing to get Locke reinstated and to win him restitution and back pay, which the city says will continue to accrue until Locke returns to his job. \"It's been a year since the campaign with Starbucks Workers United began at a Starbucks in Buffalo, NY,\" said Austin Locke in a statement released by the city. \"There are now 235 unionized Starbucks around the country. Starbucks continues to wrongfully fire pro-union workers nationwide in retaliation for union organizing.\" Starbucks has seen a wave of stores unionize across the country, and organizers have brought claims of retaliation by the company.

One in five sellers in August dropped their asking price, according to Realtor.com. A year ago that share was just 11%. The average home sold for less than its list price for the first time in over 17 months during the four-week period ended Aug. 28, according to a report by Redfin. Homes are simply not selling at the breakneck pace they were six months ago, when strong demand butted up against tight supply, bidding wars were the norm, and a seller could often get a signed contract in under a weekend. Homes in August sat on the market an average five days longer than they did a year ago \u2014 the first annual increase in time on the market in over two years. The supply of homes for sale is also rising fast, up nearly 27% from a year ago, even as fewer sellers decide to list. Pending sales in July, which represent signed contracts on existing homes and which are the most recent sales data available, were nearly 20% lower than July 2021, according to the National Association of Realtors. \"For many of today's buyers, the uptick in for-sale home options is taking away the sense of urgency that they felt during the past two years, when inventory was scarce,\" said Danielle Hale, chief economist for Realtor.com. \"As a result of this shift, coupled with higher mortgage rates, competition continued to cool in August, with listing price trends indicating that home shoppers are tightening their purse strings.\" The median listing price in August dropped to $435,000 from $449,000 in July, according to Realtor.com. Mortgage rates have been rising since January, hitting a recent high in June and then falling back slightly in July and much of August. They are, however, rising again and are now nearly matching that June high. Redfin reported that requests for home tours and other home-buying services from its agents at the end of August was down 16% from the same period the year before. Touring activity was also down 9% from the start of the year, compared with an 11% increase at the same time last year, according to home tour technology company ShowingTime. \"The post-Labor Day slowdown will likely be a little more intense this year than in previous years when the market was super tight,\" said Daryl Fairweather, Redfin's chief economist. \"Expect homes to linger on the market, which may lead to another small uptick in the share of sellers lowering their prices.\""},

The Detroit automaker reported August sales of 158,088 new vehicles in the U.S., a 27% increase from August 2021, when the company's production and sales were significantly impacted by a shortage of semiconductor chips. Last month's sales were down 3.6% compared to July, including an 8% decline in its F-Series pickup trucks. Those sales were in line with analyst expectations, though. The company said its Ford brand was America's best-selling brand for a second consecutive month. Sales of Ford's profitable F-Series pickups were up 1.7% for the month from August 2021 but off 10.7% for the first eight months of the year compared with the same period last year. The company has sold 6,842 models of its all-electric F-150 Lightning pickup as of Aug. 31, including 2,373 vehicles last month. \"F-Series was America's best-selling truck, best-selling hybrid truck and best-selling electric truck with F-150 Lightning in August. Ford's overall electric vehicle portfolio expanded four--fold in July, while conquesting from competitors at a rate over 60%,\" Andrew Frick, Ford vice president of sales, distribution and trucks, said in a release. Ford's 2022 electric vehicle sales totaled more than 36,500 units through August. That included sales of about 5,900 vehicles in August, which was 23% lower than the prior month but up more than 300% from a year ago. Year-to-date sales of all Ford's vehicles, including its luxury Lincoln brand, totaled more than 1.2 million units through August, a 0.2% decrease from a year ago. At the end of last month, the automaker's U.S. vehicle inventory, including dealer stock and in-transit vehicle, was about 259,000 units, up from 254,000 in July. J.D.

Bartiromo, the anchor of Fox Business programs \"Mornings with Maria\" and \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" is slated to appear for a deposition on Sept. 8, according to court filings. In recent days, Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson and Jeanine Pirro were among the network hosts scheduled to appear for questioning in Dominion's lawsuit, which is seeking $1.6 billion in damages from the cable news network. Dominion has argued that Fox Corp. 's Fox News and Fox Business made false claims that its voting machines rigged the results of the 2020 election between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Top brass Rupert Murdoch and Lachlan Murdoch are also expected to be deposed since the parent company has been sued, too. The case is being closely watched by First Amendment experts and advocates in part because of Dominion's lengthy list of examples that Fox network hosts repeatedly made false claims, even after the facts came to light. Libel lawsuits are often centered around one falsehood, and media companies are broadly protected by the First Amendment. Such cases are usually settled out of court or dismissed quickly by a court judge, experts say. But in December, the Delaware judge overseeing the Dominion case denied Fox News' request to have the case dismissed. Neither side has shown signs of entering discussions or reaching a settlement, according to people familiar with the matter, although that could change before the trial's expected start in April. Fox has vigorously denied the claims. \"Fox has put forth a First Amendment argument that this defamation case is aimed at punishing their speech and journalism, and this is an important component of their argument,\" said Roy Gutterman, an expert on communications law and free speech at Syracuse University's Newhouse School of Public Communications. But Gutterman said those rights can be limited \"by the concept of falsity, especially if it can bring harm to an individual or business.\" The depositions are private, as are the documents that Dominion has been collecting through the discovery process. Fox has asked the court to keep all of the collected materials private, claiming that Dominion mischaracterized what the documents show as actual malice. In court papers, Dominion has pointed to the rhetoric of hosts like Bartiromo, a former CNBC anchor, and former host Lou Dobbs and that they continued to feature guests \u2013 including Trump attorneys Rudy Giuliani and Sydney Powell \u2013 who made false claims that voter fraud was the reason Trump didn't surpass Biden to win the 2020 election. Dobbs was also previously scheduled for questioning, filings show. \"Fox, one of the most powerful media companies in the United States, gave life to a manufactured storyline about election fraud that cast a then-little-known voting machine company called Dominion as the villain,\" the company said in its initial court filing in March 2021. Fox News' legal team recently added veteran trial attorney Dan Webb to its roster. Webb told the Washington Post earlier this week that Fox News was only reporting on the news and claims being made by Trump's allies. \"We are confident we will prevail as freedom of the press is foundational to our democracy and must be protected, in addition to the damages claims being outrageous, unsupported and not rooting in sound financial analysis, serving as nothing more than a flagrant attempt to deter our journalists from doing their jobs,\" a Fox News spokesperson said in a statement. To win a defamation case, a plaintiff needs to show that the individual or business they're suing made false statements that caused harm, and that it acted with \"actual malice,\" meaning the speaker knew or should have known what they were saying wasn't true. \"A key issue in these depositions will be the state of mind of Fox as embodied by the journalists covering this or commenting on it,\" said Floyd Abrams, a prominent First Amendment attorney. \"What will someone like Lou Dobbs say? Will he say he believed what he was saying beyond simple reportage?\" Dominion said in court papers that it repeatedly sent emails to notify Fox News that its anchors and their guests were making false claims \u2013 and that Dominion had \"independent fact-checkers, government officials and election security experts\" that quashed those claims. Other current and former Fox News executives have been called on for depositions, court filings show. Dominion has also filed lawsuits against the TV networks One America News and Newsmax. Another voting machine maker, Smartmatic USA, has made similar claims in a defamation lawsuit against Fox News that alleged Dobbs and other hosts falsely accused the company of helping to rig the election. A New York judge earlier this year denied Fox News' motion to dismiss the lawsuit. Shortly after Smartmatic filed its lawsuit, Fox News canceled Dobbs' weekday business show, \"Lou Dobbs Tonight.\" Fox has previously said the move to end Dobbs' program was in the works prior to the lawsuit."},

John Eastman also invoked protections under attorney-client privilege in refusing to answer at least some questions he was asked before the grand jury, which was convened as part of a criminal probe into the possibility of illegal interference in Georgia's presidential election contest, his attorneys said. Eastman is one of a group of Trump allies who were subpoenaed by that panel, which is hearing testimony in Atlanta. A second ally, Trump's former personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, has been named a target in that investigation and recently testified before the same grand jury. Eastman wrote a series of memos after the 2020 election calling on then-Vice President Mike Pence to effectively undo President Joe Biden 's win by refusing to certify the Electoral College results. \"In his appearance before the Fulton County Special Grand Jury, we advised our client John Eastman to assert attorney-client privilege and the constitutional right to remain silent where appropriate,\" Eastman's lawyers, Charles Burnham and Harvey Silverglate, said in a statement. \"Out of respect for grand jury secrecy we will not disclose the substance of the questions or testimony. We wish to thank the grand jurors for their service,\" the attorneys said. The statement also blasted Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis for the probe itself. \"By all indications, the District Attorney's Office has set itself on an unprecedented path of criminalizing controversial or disfavored legal theories, possibly in hopes that the federal government will follow its lead,\" the lawyers said. \"Criminalization of unpopular legal theories is against every American tradition and would have ended the careers of John Adams, Ruth Ginsburg, Thurgood Marshall and many other now-celebrated American lawyers,\" the statement said. Adams was the second president of the United States, while Ginsburg and Marshall were Supreme Court justices who helped establish new legal precedents with their work during the civil rights movement. \"We ask all interested observers of any political persuasion to join us in decrying this troubling development,\" Burnham and Silverglate wrote. Eastman last month revealed that his cellphone was seized by federal agents who stopped him in New Mexico and forced him to unlock it. That seizure was done as part of an investigation by the Justice Department's internal watchdog, the Office of the Inspector General. The IG's office is probing the role of the Justice Department and its components in \"preparing for and responding to\" the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters, according to the office's website. That riot occurred as a joint session of Congress was convened to certify Biden's victory, with Pence presiding over the proceedings. A former Justice Department official, Jeffrey Clark, had electronics seized from his Virginia home on the same day that Eastman's phone was seized. Clark also backed Trump's effort to overturn the election. Trump considered installing Clark as attorney general in the days leading up to Jan. 6, 2021, but dropped the idea after a group of top Justice officials said they would resign in protest if that happened."},

Narasimhan most recently served as CEO of health and hygiene company Reckitt, which owns brands such as Lysol, Durex and Mucinex. He announced earlier Thursday he was stepping down from that role. He'll join Starbucks in October, learning about the company and its reinvention plan, before assuming the top job in April. Until then, Howard Schultz will continue as interim CEO of the coffee chain he grew into a global giant. Schultz will remain on Starbucks' board after Narasimhan succeeds him. Schultz has been at the helm since April, when his handpicked successor Kevin Johnson retired after five years on the job. Schultz returned to the company as its interim CEO, earning just $1 for his salary. In the meantime, Schultz and the Starbucks board hunted for a long-term successor, with the intention of announcing the new CEO in the fall. (The coffee chain brought back the Pumpkin Spice Latte and other fall menu items on Tuesday.) Schultz has previously said that he wants to reinvent the employee, customer and store experience to reckon with how the world has changed since the pandemic. The company is holding an investor day on Sept. 13 in Seattle, where it's expected to unveil more details about the bold changes it plans to make. Starbucks said in a news release that Schultz will remain \"closely involved\" with the plan and act as an advisor to Narasimhan. Narasimhan previously worked at PepsiCo, serving as its global chief commercial officer among other roles. Prior to working at the food and beverage giant, he was a senior partner at McKinsey. As CEO, he'll have to tackle a number of challenges. In its home market, Starbucks is facing a union push, with more than 200 stores in the U.S. voting to organize under Workers United. The battle has resulted in negative headlines and legal battles. Inflation hasn't hurt sales yet, but it has pushed menu prices higher. And China, its second-largest market, is struggling to bounce back from the pandemic, hampered by the country's zero Covid policy. \"His deep, hands-on experience driving strategic transformations at global consumer-facing businesses makes him the ideal choice to accelerate Starbucks growth and capture the opportunities ahead of us,\" Starbucks board chair Mellody Hobson said in a statement."},

The narrowly focused filing in U.S. District Court in West Palm Beach came one day after the Department of Justice argued that appointing a special master could harm the government's national security interests. The DOJ's filing also said that \"efforts were likely taken to obstruct the government's investigation\" into the records that had been shipped to Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence after the end of his presidency. And the DOJ revealed that the FBI seized more than 100 classified documents from the Palm Beach resort during its search of the premises earlier this month. The agency also shared a redacted FBI photo showing documents with classification markings that had been recovered from a container in Trump's \"45 Office.\" Trump's legal team in its Wednesday night reply accused the DOJ of twisting \"the framework of responding to a motion for a Special Master into an all-encompassing challenge to any judicial consideration, presently or in the future, of any aspect of its unprecedented behavior in this investigation.\" The government's \"extraordinary document\" suggests \"that the DOJ, and the DOJ alone, should be entrusted with the responsibility of evaluating its unjustified pursuit of criminalizing a former President's possession of personal and Presidential records in a secure setting,\" Trump's lawyers wrote. They also accused the DOJ of providing multiple \"misleading or incomplete statement[s] of purported 'fact,'\" but offered few specifics. Judge Aileen Cannon, who was appointed by Trump, has set a hearing for Thursday at 1 p.m. ET in a West Palm Beach courthouse. Trump had sued to block the Justice Department from further investigating any materials taken in the Mar-a-Lago raid until a special master is able to analyze them. That step is typically taken when there is a chance that some evidence should be withheld from prosecutors because of various legal privileges. The DOJ told the judge on Monday that its review of the seized materials was complete, and that a law enforcement team had identified a \"limited set\" of materials that may be protected by attorney-client privilege. That privilege often refers to the legal doctrine that protects the confidentiality of communications between an attorney and their client. Trump's lawyers responded Wednesday that the so-called privilege review team was \"wholly deficient\" in identifying and separating all potentially privileged documents from the rest of the seized materials. Trump and his office have publicly claimed that he declassified all the documents that had been seized by the FBI. But Trump's legal team has not made that explicit argument in the civil lawsuit before Cannon. The DOJ in Tuesday's late-night filing said that when 15 boxes were retrieved from Mar-a-Lago by the National Archives in January, Trump \"never asserted executive privilege over any of the documents nor claimed that any of the documents in the boxes containing classification markings had been declassified.\" The government also said that no claims about declassification were made when FBI agents went to Mar-a-Lago on June 3, pursuant to a grand jury subpoena to collect any more records in Trump's possession that bore classification markings. The DOJ said it obtained that subpoena in May, after the FBI developed evidence that dozens of boxes with classified information \u2014 beyond the 15 boxes retrieved in January \u2014 were still at Trump's residence. \"When producing the documents, neither counsel nor the custodian asserted that the former President had declassified the documents or asserted any claim of executive privilege. Instead, counsel handled them in a manner that suggested counsel believed that the documents were classified: the production included a single Redweld envelope, double-wrapped in tape, containing the documents,\" the DOJ wrote. At the same time, Trump's custodian of records had also provided a sworn certification letter, claiming that \"any and all\" documents responsive to a grand jury subpoena had been handed over, the DOJ wrote. But the FBI later \"uncovered multiple sources of evidence\" indicating that more classified documents remained at Mar-a-Lago, according to the DOJ's filing. \"The government also developed evidence that government records were likely concealed and removed from the Storage Room and that efforts were likely taken to obstruct the government's investigation,\" the DOJ wrote. That and other information led the government to seek a warrant to search Mar-a-Lago, which was ultimately carried out Aug. 8. In their reply on Wednesday, Trump's lawyers wrote that the DOJ's account of the June 3 meeting \"has been significantly mischaracterized.\" \"If the Government provided the same untrue account in the affidavit in support of the search warrant, then they misled the Magistrate Judge,\" the former president's lawyers wrote. Trump, in a social media post earlier Wednesday evening, also accused the DOJ of being \"very deceiving\" by sharing a photo that appears to show numerous classified papers strewn about on a carpeted floor. Trump clarified that the FBI \"took them out of cartons and spread them around on the carpet, making it look like a big 'find' for them.\" \"They dropped them, not me - Very deceiving...And remember, we could have NO representative, including lawyers, present during the Raid. They were told to wait outside,\" Trump wrote."},

But details of how many of those records the Mazars USA accounting firm will turn over were not included in a committee statement announcing the agreement Thursday. The deal does not cover a separate lawsuit involving the House Ways and Means Committee, which is seeking Trump's federal tax returns from 2015 through 2020. Last month, a federal appeals court said the Ways and Means Committee could get those returns. The agreement with the Oversight Committee came nearly two months after another panel of judges in the same appeals court in Washington, D.C., upheld a prior ruling that the Oversight Committee had the authority to subpoena certain of Trump's financial records from Mazars in furtherance of legislative purposes. However, the appeals court also told the committee to winnow the scope of the records it wanted to see. On Wednesday, Trump's lawyers told the court in a filing that in light of the settlement agreement with the Oversight Committee, he would drop a motion seeking a rehearing of the case, and a related one asking that the entire lineup of judges on the appeals court take up the issue. In a statement, committee Chairwoman Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., said, \"After facing years of delay tactics, the Committee has now reached an agreement with the former President and his accounting firm, Mazars USA, to obtain critical documents.\" \"These documents will inform the Committee's efforts to get to the bottom of former President Trump's egregious conduct and ensure that future presidents do not abuse their position of power for personal gain,\" Maloney said. The committee said that under the agreement, \"Mazars USA has agreed to comply with the court's order and produce responsive documents to the Committee as expeditiously as possible.\" A lawyer for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The committee sought the documents in 2019 as part of its investigation into Trump's conflicts of interest involving his businesses while serving as president and his foreign financial ties. The panel issued its subpoena to Mazars for Trump's records after his former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, testified to the Oversight Committee that Trump's financial statements had falsely represented his financial position. Trump then sued to block Mazars from surrendering the records. The case ended up before the Supreme Court, which in 2020 sent the lawsuit back to lower federal courts with the direction to apply a new standard for evaluating the merit of congressional subpoenas for a president's personal information."},

Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and FBI agents along with NYPD detectives were seen carrying boxes during a search of 19 Duck Pond Lane in Southampton, N.Y., and the search of 515 Park Ave. in Manhattan. Records show those properties are linked to sanctioned Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg, a billionaire and close ally of President Vladimir Putin who heads the Moscow-based Renova Group, a conglomerate with interests in the metals, mining, and tech industries, according to U.S. Treasury Department documents. A search is also underway at a property on Miami's Fisher Island that authorities say was linked to Vekselberg, according to sources familiar with the matter. The U.S. seizure of Vekselberg's $900 million superyacht in early April marked the first under newly imposed Western sanctions targeting assets of Russian elites in response to the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine. Vekselberg is one of numerous Russian oligarchs to face sanctions since the start of the war. In addition to sanctions, Vekselberg has been the subject of a U.S. Department of Justice investigation into allegations of bank fraud. No charges have been filed in that case. All of Vekselberg's assets in the U.S. are frozen and American companies are barred from doing business with him and his entities. The Ukrainian-born businessman built his fortune by investing in the aluminum and oil industries in the post-Soviet era. Vekselberg has long had ties to the U.S., including a green card he once held and homes in New York and Connecticut. He was also questioned in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. A call to an attorney associated with the Hamptons property was not immediately returned Thursday. Attempts to reach a representative for Vekselberg were not immediately successful. HSI and FBI confirmed their agents were at those locations but declined further comment. The U.S. Department of Justice and NYPD declined immediate comment.

Lindsey Graham's latest effort to fully quash a subpoena for his testimony before a special grand jury in Georgia as part of its probe into possible criminal election interference by former President Donald Trump and his allies in 2020. But the judge also limited the scope of the subpoena by ordering that Graham, a South Carolina Republican and close Trump ally, cannot be asked about his \"investigatory fact-finding on telephone calls to Georgia election officials\" during his testimony. She was referring to phone calls Graham made to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and his staff in the weeks after the November 2020 election between Trump and President Joe Biden. Graham's lawyers have argued that those calls were \"quintessentially legislative factfinding\" by a sitting U.S. senator, and as such are protected by the speech and debate clause of the Constitution. That off-limits topic includes how the information he gathered \"related to his decision to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election,\" the judge ruled. \"The Court finds that this area of inquiry falls under the protection of the Speech or Debate Clause, which prohibits questions on legislative activity,\" Judge Leigh Martin May wrote in Thursday's order in U.S. District Court in Atlanta. But May rejected Graham's other arguments to either throw out the subpoena or sharply limit the questions that Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis' office can ask him. \"As to the other categories, the Court finds that they are not legislative, and the Speech or Debate Clause does not apply to them,\" May wrote. \"As such, Senator Graham may be questioned about any alleged efforts to encourage Secretary Raffensperger or others to throw out ballots or otherwise alter Georgia's election practices and procedures,\" the judge ordered. \"Likewise, the grand jury may inquire into Senator Graham's alleged communications and coordination with the Trump Campaign and its post-election efforts in Georgia, as well as into Senator Graham's public statements related to Georgia's 2020 elections,\" May wrote. Graham's challenge now goes back to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, where the senator filed an appeal after a previous ruling from Judge May denying his bid to quash the subpoena. \"We are pleased that the district court recognized that Senator Graham's testimony is protected by the Speech or Debate Clause,\" Graham's office said in a statement later Thursday. \"He will continue to defend the institutional interests of the Senate and the Constitution before the Eleventh Circuit.\" The order for Graham's testimony in Georgia's probe came one day after John Eastman, a pro-Trump lawyer who worked to overturn Biden's presidential victory, appeared before the grand jury and refused to answer questions. Eastman invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, as well as protections under attorney-client privilege, in refusing to answer at least some questions he was asked before the grand jury, his attorneys said. Rudy Giuliani, Trump's former personal attorney who was a leading voice challenging the 2020 election results, also recently testified before the grand jury."},

Judge Aileen Cannon also will make public a status report by the investigation team probing the removal of documents from the White House when Trump left office in early 2021. But Cannon ended the hearing without ruling on a pending request by Trump to appoint an independent watchdog, known as a special master, who would review government documents seized by the FBI before the Department of Justice would be allowed to use the records to advance its probe. Cannon said she will rule later on that request, which Trump made in a lawsuit filed last month in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. Trump's lawyers had requested a more detailed list of documents taken from Mar-a-Lago than the less revealing inventory they have previously received from investigators. The DOJ is opposing the call for a special master, arguing that it will unjustifiably delay its criminal investigation. The Justice Department also has said that a review of the documents by a team of internal department watchdogs already has completed its own review and identified some records that would potentially be exempt from use in the investigation because they are protected by attorney-client privilege. In a separate ruling Thursday, Cannon said she will keep sealed a status report on that review by the DOJ's so-called filter team. Jay Bratt, the DOJ's top counterintelligence official, also argued at the hearing that Trump is not entitled to a review of the documents by a special master because \"he is no longer the president.\" \"And because he's no longer the president, he had no right to those documents ... that ends the analysis,\" Bratt said. Special masters, often drawn from the ranks of retired judges, are typically appointed in cases where there is a risk that some of the records seized by law enforcement should be barred from use in an investigation because they are protected by attorney-client privilege. Trump's lawyers, however, argue that some of the records could be protected by executive privilege that would result from him having been president at the time they were created. In a court filing Tuesday, the DOJ revealed that more than 100 classified documents were found at Mar-a-Lago, the private club in Palm Beach, Florida, where Trump maintains a residence, during the Aug. 8 raid. That discovery came two months after Trump's lawyers, in response to a federal grand jury subpoena, provided the DOJ with a sworn certification that a search of Trump's living quarters and office had not found records that were marked classified. Tuesday's filing said there is evidence that government records including the ones marked classified were likely concealed and removed from a storage room at that residence in an effort to \"obstruct the government's investigation.\" Authorities have said the National Archives and Records Administration tried for about a year after Trump left the White House in January 2021 to obtain documents it suspected were still in his possession. When Trump did give up 15 boxes of records from Mar-a-Lago earlier this year, they were found to contain highly classified material, leading to the opening of the DOJ probe, and eventually the Aug. 8 raid. Trump has argued that he declassified the records before leaving office. But whether or not the documents remain classified is irrelevant under the criminal laws that the DOJ is eyeing in the case, which include the espionage statute and obstruction of justice. By law, White House records must be turned over to NARA when a president leaves office. During Thursday's hearing, Trump lawyer Jim Trusty repeated an analogy that has become popular among defenders of the former president on the records issue. \"We've characterized it at times as an overdue library book scenario where there's a dispute \u2014 not even a dispute \u2014 but ongoing negotiations with [the National Archives] that has suddenly been transformed into a criminal investigation,\" Trusty said, according to NBC News. Trusty's claim omitted mention of a grand jury subpoena issued for the documents."},

The White House's hope is that it will remain a winning strategy two months out from the midterm elections which will decide who controls the House of Representatives and Senate. The trip marks his second visit to the critical swing state of Pennsylvania in three days. \"For a long time, we've reassured ourselves that American democracy is guaranteed. But it is not,\" Biden said. \"We have to defend it. Protect it. Stand up for it. Each and every one of us. That's why tonight I'm asking our nation to come together and unite behind the single purpose of defending our democracy regardless of your ideology.\" Democrats' odds of keeping their majorities in both chambers of Congress have brightened in recent weeks despite the mixed economic signals, as Republicans continue to receive blowback from the Supreme Court's decision on abortion overturning Roe v. Wade and investigations into Trump persist. An NBC News poll released last week found a majority of American voters, 58%, disapprove of the Dobbs decision and nearly the same amount, 57%, believe the investigations into Trump should continue. \"MAGA forces are determined to take this country backwards,\" Biden said. \"Backwards to an America where there is no right to choose, no right to privacy, no right to contraception, no right to marry who you love.\" Since Trump entered office, Biden has said the country faces \"a battle for the soul of the nation.\" The significance of the threat to democracy is underscored by Biden's choice of venue: Independence National Historic Park where the Constitution was penned. The same NBC News poll found that \"threats to democracy\" has overtaken the cost of living as the most pressing issue on voters' minds. Biden has amped up his criticism of Republicans recently, seeking to position Democrats as an alternative to a party led by extremists. Last week he referred to Republicans as \"semi-fascist\" for staying loyal to the former president. His remarks come against the backdrop of Trump's legal woes following the FBI raid on his Florida home Mar-A-Lago where the former president is accused of mishandling classified information."},

It represents yet another example of beverage companies blurring the lines between drink categories, seeking to leverage existing brand loyalty while entering fast-growing categories. Gatorade's parent company, PepsiCo, has already expanded Mountain Dew into alcoholic and energy drinks. The company says Fast Twitch is designed to give athletes an extra boost before their workouts. The market for preworkout powders is growing, fueled by industry leaders such as Cellucor C4 and RSP Nutrition. But few preworkout drinks exist, and many consumers instead turn to carbonated, sugary energy drinks. Anuj Bhasin, general manager of Gatorade, said roughly 32 million consumers reject the energy drink category for the negative health effects. Fast Twitch aims to attract those consumers, offering plenty of caffeine but no sugar or carbonation. The new drink is slated to launch in February, but NFL players will be drinking it on sidelines during the upcoming season as part of an exclusive deal with the league. Bhasin said Gatorade worked with the NFL and its sports performance experts to develop the specific formula. The finished product comes in a petite 12-ounce bottle with brightly colored packaging. While smaller, it tastes pretty similar to traditional Gatorade. A bottle of Fast Twitch contains electrolytes, B-vitamins and 200 milligrams of caffeine. For comparison, a 12-ounce can of Red Bull has nearly half as much caffeine but 37 grams of sugar. Bolt24, another recent offshoot of Gatorade, has just 75 milligrams of caffeine in its Energize line, which is being phased out. \"Two hundred milligrams is the right amount to help athletes seeking benefits for exercise performance,\" said Matthew Pahnke, senior principal scientist at the Gatorade Sports Science Institute. Since its creation nearly six decades ago, Gatorade has built its brand on hydration, spreading the word about the benefits of electrolytes and carbohydrates. But caffeine is a natural diuretic, removing salt and water from the body. As a result, Fast Twitch is meant to precede drinking a more hydrating beverage during an actual workout, the company says. \"We know athletes will mix and match things,\" Pahnke said. Fast Twitch will target consumers who are 18 years old or older due to the high caffeine content, according to Bhasin. Fast Twitch follows a broader push by Pepsi into energy drinks. Over the last three years, the company bought Rockstar Energy for $3.85 billion, launched Mtn Dew Rise Energy with the endorsement of NBA superstar Lebron James and acquired a minority stake in up-and-coming energy drink maker Celsius for $550 million. Celsius is a potential competitor for Fast Twitch. The upstart markets its beverages as \"fitness drinks,\" and its marketing shows models swinging kettle bells and stretching. Another challenger also has ties to Gatorade's parent company. Bang Energy, which recently ended an acrimonious distribution deal with Pepsi, markets itself as a preworkout or recovery drink. Beyond being highly caffeinated, it touts \"super creatine,\" which claims to boost muscle performance, but no sugar. But Pepsi is already the dominant leader in the U.S. sports drink category, holding 73.2% market share with Gatorade and G Zero, according to Euromonitor International data. Bodyarmor jumped to second place in 2021 with 11.7% market share, overtaking Coca-Cola 's Powerade. Coke purchased full control of Bodyarmor in November for $5.6 billion in a play to increase its market share. Changing consumer tastes led to slowing sales growth for the sports drink market, even as U.S. adults exercise more. Years of backlash from lawmakers and pediatricians about sports drinks' high sugar and calorie counts didn't help either. But Gatorade staged a comeback, focusing on options with more electrolytes and less sugar, such as recent spin-offs G Fit, Gatorlyte and Bolt24. In the second quarter, Pepsi reported double-digit revenue growth for the Gatorade brand. However, not all of Gatorade's innovations have paid off. An organic version of the drink released in 2016 failed to take off and was discontinued several years later. Energy represents an opportunity in a fast-growing segment, but it lacks trust from consumers who exercise. Gatorade, on the other hand, has earned plenty of trust from that customer base. \"We found this to be the sweet spot of bringing a new brand to market, with the distinction of being from the makers of Gatorade, much like Propel,\" Bhasin said."},

The fast-food giant ended the offering during the early days of pandemic lockdowns as part of a broader scheme to simplify service. Bloated menus can overwhelm customers, slow down kitchen operations and lead to longer drive-thru lines. Many U.S. franchisees cheered the decision, but customers have been asking the company's Twitter account about when all-day breakfast will return. A Twitter user revived the conversation on Thursday, tweeting a screenshot of a McDonald's press release that said all-day breakfast would be served starting Oct. 6. But bad news for Egg McMuffin lovers: a McDonald's representative confirmed that the release is from 2015, when the chain created its all-day breakfast menu. Former CEO Steve Easterbrook launched the menu as part of a turnaround plan to revitalize the burger chain's sluggish sales, and the company credited the move for driving sales growth. But it looks unlikely that the all-day breakfast menu will return. Even before the pandemic, operators had been asking the company to whittle down all-day breakfast items to speed up service. As McDonald's management began looking to add menu items back after lockdowns ended, CEO Chris Kempczinski told analysts that his team was working with franchisees to make sure \"every item that we add earns its way back onto the menu.\" With franchisee relations at a low point now over disagreements to new ownership terms, bringing back all-day breakfast could further fuel tensions."},

Agents found 43 of those empty folders marked classified in Trump's office, according to the Department of Justice's inventory of the seized items, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The remaining five empty folders with that marking were found in containers in a storage room. The FBI also found another 42 empty folders marked \"Return to Staff Secretary/Miliary [sic] Aide,\" during the Aug. 8 raid, which was authorized to search for government documents removed from the White House when Trump left office in Jan. 2021, the filing said. Twenty-eight of those empty folders were found in Trump's office, while another 14 were in a storage room elsewhere, the document shows. And FBI agents found more than 10,000 government documents and photographs without classification markings, the filing shows. Among those were hundreds of photos and news articles, along with gifts, clothing, and books. The bombshell revelations raise the prospect that the DOJ has not yet recovered the documents that would have been in the empty folders. The DOJ is investigating possible crimes related to the removal of those and other government documents from the White House when Trump left office in Jan. 2021. By law, such records must be turned over to the National Archives and Records Administration. On Tuesday, the DOJ said in another court filing that more than 100 classified documents were found at Mar-a-Lago. That property receipt noted that the government seized 11 sets of classified documents, as well as an executive grant of clemency regarding Roger Stone, a longtime Republican operative and Trump confidant. The previously disclosed property inventory of items seized lists multiple U.S. government documents with \"confidential,\" \"secret\" and \"top secret\" classification markings. The detailed inventory made public Friday was one of two court filings related to the FBI raid that were ordered unsealed by Judge Aileen Cannon after she conducted a hearing Thursday on a request by Trump's lawyers to appoint a third-party to review the seized records. The other document unsealed Friday is titled, \"Notice of Investigative Team of Status of Review,\" and notes that the criminal probe did not end with the raid. It was signed by Miami U.S. Attorney Juan Gonzalez, and Jay Bratt, the chief of the counterintelligence and export control section of the national security division of the Justice Department. \"The seized materials will continue to be used to further the government's investigation, and the investigative team will continue to use and evaluate the seized materials as it takes further investigative steps, such as through additional interviews and grand jury practice,\" that notice says. \"It is important to note, 'review' of the seized materials is not a single investigative step but an ongoing process in this active criminal investigation,\" the document says. Trump's spokesman in a series of tweets about the inventory of the seized items again criticized the raid. \"The new 'detailed' inventory list only further proves that this unprecedented and unnecessary raid of President Trump's home was not some surgical, confined search and retrieval that the Biden administration claims, it was a SMASH AND GRAB,\" wrote the spokesman, Taylor Budowich. \"These document disputes should be resolved under the Presidential Records Act, which requires cooperation and negotiation by NARA [National Archives and Records Administration], not an armed FBI raid,\" Budowich added. Trump in a lawsuit filed in late August asked Cannon to appoint an independent watchdog, known as a special master, to review the items seized in the search before the DOJ is allowed to continue using the documents in the investigation. Trump's lawyers have said a special master could check to see if some documents would be prohibited from being used in the probe because they are protected by either attorney-client privilege or executive privilege. The DOJ has opposed the appointment of a special master, saying that it would delay the investigation, and that Trump does not own the documents. Cannon, during a court hearing in Florida on that dispute Thursday, said she will issue a ruling on the special master request in \"due course.\" Cannon, a Trump appointee, previously shared her \"preliminary intent\" to grant Trump's request for a special master. The judge suggested in Thursday's hearing that she is still considering that appointment, news outlets reported."},

The employees, who spoke with CNBC on the condition of anonymity, said since they have been asked to return to offices, infections notifications pop up in their email inboxes regularly. Employees are reacting with frustration and memes. The company began requiring most employees to return to physical offices at least three days a week in April. Since then, staffers have pushed back on the mandate after they worked efficiently for so long at home while the company enjoyed some of its fastest revenue growth in 15 years. Google has offered full-time employees the option to request permanent remote work, but it's unclear how many workers have been approved. Google\u2019s Covid-19 outbreak in Los Angeles is currently the largest of any employer in LA., according to the city\u2019s public health dashboard. Deadline.com first reported that the tech giant\u2019s trendy Silicon Beach campus in Venice, Calif., recorded 145 infections while 135 cases were recorded at the company\u2019s large Playa Vista campus. A spokesperson for Google told CNBC, \"There has not been a significant increase of onsite COVID-19 transmission on our campuses. The numbers that have been reported in Playa Vista and Venice reflect total cases over the last few months, not current or active cases.\" Staffers have been filling Memegen, an internal company image-sharing site, with memes about the increased number of exposure notifications they're receiving. One meme, which was upvoted 2,840 times, showed a photo of an inbox with the email subject from a San Francisco-based facilities manager stating \u201cWe\u2019re so excited to see you back in the office!\u201d and a subsequent email subject line stating \u201cNotification of Confirmed COVID-19 Case.\u201d Another meme with hundreds of upvotes said \u201cHow it started\u201d with an image of a rainbow arch followed by \u201cHow it\u2019s going\u201d and a wall of text saying \u201cNotification of confirmed Covid-19 case.\u201d Another featured an illustration of a happy Pokemon touring a Bay Area campus next to another photo of a worried Pokemon after getting a Covid-19 notification followed by an alarmed Pokemon with 29 exposure notifications. Another meme shows a picture of Star Wars character Rey, whose caption says \u201cI didn\u2019t know there was this much \u2018Notification of Confirmed COVID-19 Cases\u2019 in the whole galaxy.\u201d Some employees said they received a spike in notifications from the Mountain View, Calif. headquarters and in San Francisco offices after the company held a return-to-office celebration, where Grammy award-winning artist Lizzo performed for thousands of employees at the Shoreline Amphitheater, near Google's main campus. The spokesperson for Google also noted that the company follows methodology laid out by state and local laws in determining the definition of a Covid outbreak, and when to send exposure emails. Last December, Google told employees that they must comply with vaccine policies or they'd face losing pay and then losing their job. Then in February, ahead of asking employees to come back, it relaxed rules around vaccines being a requirement for employment, as well as other rules around testing, social distancing and masks. But it continued to require Covid-19 vaccination to enter physical offices. Now, some Google employees are asking the company to drop the vaccine mandate, arguing Covid-19 outbreaks keep happening anyway in the offices where employees are fully vaccinated. While it still provides a level of protection, the vaccines aren't as strong against the highly transmissible BA.5 variant, the fastest-spreading variant of Covid-19 to date, the group argues in a manifesto called \u201cNo Vaccine Mandate,\" which was posted this month and viewed by CNBC. (The vaccines are still providing good protection against severe disease and death, including with the BA.5 variant, but are not providing substantial protection against infection or mild illness.) The anonymous manifesto says the group, which calls itself Googlers for No Vaccine Mandate, is frustrated that non-vaccinated employees and those who decline to declare their vaccination status are still banned from offices and other gatherings including off-sites, summits and team events. It also claims that some Google employees still haven't met their teams since March 2020 and some were never notified of the vaccination policy during their hiring process. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen waves of Covid-particularly since December 2021 with Omicron and its sub variants spread through Google offices with little regard for vaccination status. We\u2019ve seen many fully vaccinated and boosted colleagues call out sick for multiple days with Covid. We\u2019ve seen both panics and good natured responses to the flood of exposure notifications received by officegoers.\" Other companies that once mandated Covid vaccination requirements have since dropped them, including Boeing, Intel, and United Airlines, citing a federal court\u2019s decision to prohibit enforcement of the federal contractor executive order that required vaccination of large employers that are also government contractors. The group's manifesto says it is hoping Google leadership does the same thing. The group is largely anonymous, although some members' identities are known to CNBC. It claims to include hundreds of employees with tenures of up to 10 years, in roles such as engineering, program management, UX design, education, sales, marketing and finance. It also includes Googlers who are fully vaccinated and \u201cbelieve the company\u2019s vaccine policy is an invasion of privacy and is insensitive to individual circumstances and risk factors.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re writing to ask for your help for a group of Googlers who still aren\u2019t allowed back to our offices,\" the memo states. \u201cWe are reaching out to you as colleagues and peers because our direct appeals to Google leadership have been ignored. When planning an in-person meeting, summit or offsite, think about how Googlers who are barred from full participation by the vaccine policy can be acknowledged and included.\""},

Although monkeypox cases are still increasing nationally, the speed of the outbreak appears to be slowing, Walensky said. The U.S. has reported nearly 17,000 monkeypox cases since May, more than any other country in the world, according to CDC data. In New York City, which has reported more infections than any other jurisdiction, new monkeypox cases have dropped from more than 70 per day on average to nine as of Thursday, according to data from the city health department. Dr. Aswhin Vasan, the city health commissioner, said earlier this week the outbreak has slowed due to increased vaccination and community outreach efforts. New York City has reported a total of 2,888 monkeypox cases. In Chicago, another major epicenter of the outbreak, new cases have dropped from 141 during the week ended July 30 to 74 for the week ended Aug. 20, according to that city's health department. Chicago has reported a total of 807 cases. \"We're not seeing the potentially exponential growth that we were seeing early on so that is reassuring,\" said Dr. Allison Arwady, Chicago's public health commissioner, during a Facebook live event earlier this week. \"Too early to say things look really good, but definitely some signs of slowing of cases.\" The U.S. is nearing the point where the entire community of gay and bisexual men who currently face the greatest health risk from monkeypox rwill have access to two doses of the monkeypox vaccine, according to Dawn O'Connell, head of the office responsible for the national stockpile at the Health and Human Services Department. The CDC previously estimated that up to 1.7 million gay and bisexual men who are HIV-positive or are eligible for medicine to reduce their chance of contracting HIV face the greatest health risk from monkeypox. The U.S. has distributed 1.5 million doses of the monkeypox vaccine so far and more than 3 million doses should be available by when the latest distribution round is complete, according to O'Connell. To date, the outbreak is disproportionately affecting Black and Hispanic men. About 30% of monkeypox patients are white, 32% are Hispanic and 33% are Black, according to CDC data. Whites make up about 59% of the U.S. population while Hispanics and Blacks account for 19% and 13%, respectively. The monkeypox vaccine, called Jynneos in the U.S., is administered in two doses 28 days apart. The patients will not have full protection from the vaccine until two weeks after the second dose is administered, according to the CDC. Data from 19 jurisdictions show that nearly 97% of the shots administered so far were first doses, according to Walensky. About 94% of monkeypox cases are associated with sexual contact and nearly all of the people who have contracted the virus are men who have sex with men, according to Demetre Daskalakis, the deputy head of the White House monkeypox response team. A CDC survey of 824 gay and bisexual men found that 48% respondents have reduced their number of sexual partners and 50% have reduced one-time sexual encounters during the current outbreak. A separate CDC study found that a 40% decrease in one-time sexual encounters would reduce the final percentage of gay and bisexual men infected with monkeypox by up to 31%. \"We're actually seeing vaccine get out, behaviors change, harm-reduction messages being heard and implemented,\" Walensky said. \"And all of that working together to bend the curve.\" Correction: 33% of confirmed monkeypox cases are among Black Americans. A previous version of this story misstated the figure."},

Over the past two years, fall and winter have brought devastating Covid surges that took hundreds of thousands of lives and pushed hospitals to the breaking point. But U.S. health officials say the nation is in a much different place today due to the arsenal of tools doctors now have to fight the virus. \"We are in a much, much better place. We are in a better place because people have gotten vaccinated and boosted. We've got treatments that are widely available,\" Dr. Ashish Jha, White House Covid response coordinator, said in an August interview with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in a report published in early August, said high levels of immunity in the U.S. population from vaccination and infection have substantially reduced the threat of hospitalization and death from Covid. The CDC ended its quarantine recommendations for people exposed to the virus last month. Public health officials are calling on people to stay up to date on their vaccines, but are largely leaving it up to individuals to decide what other precautions they should take based on their health history, risk tolerance and how much Covid is spreading in their communities. The CDC is taking a more targeted approach that focuses on making sure those at the highest risk of severe illness have access to vaccines, antiviral treatments and other therapeutics to protect their health. Many people haven't had a vaccine dose in months, which means their immune protection against the virus is waning off with some studies showing three shots of the original vaccines were just 19% effective at preventing Covid infection after five months. At the same time, more transmissible omicron subvariants are spreading. It's creating a perfect storm ahead of the cold weather months and holidays that force people indoors in close proximity to each other and a highly contagious airborne pathogen. Even with all the tools the U.S. has available, Covid infections, hospitalizations and deaths have plateaued at stubbornly high levels over the summer. The U.S. is gearing up for a booster campaign after Labor Day with reformulated vaccines that target both the original strain of the virus that emerged in Wuhan, China, in 2019 and omicron BA.5, the dominant variant in circulation. Public health officials believe the reformulated boosters will provide more durable protection against infection and help avert a major surge that taxes hospitals. \"It's going to be really, really important for people to get this updated, new, very specific Covid vaccine because I think it's going to help a lot in preventing infections, and I think it is going to help a lot in keeping people out of the hospital,\" Jha said. The U.S. has so far secured 171 million doses of Pfizer's and Moderna's new boosters shots that target omicron. The reformulated boosters could reduce infections by 2.4 million, hospitalizations by 137,000 and deaths by 9,700 from August through May of 2023 if a new variant doesn't emerge, according to a projection by a team of scientists who forecast the trajectory of the pandemic, called the Covid-19 Scenario Modeling Hub. But the projection is based on optimistic assumptions about booster coverage and efficacy, according to the scientists. The model assumes that the shots will prove 80% effective at preventing illness, the vaccination campaign will ramp up quickly and the public will broadly embrace the new boosters. But many people in the U.S. still haven't gotten their first booster with the old vaccine yet, and it's not clear that these individuals will be more willing to take the new shots. About 76% of people ages 12 and older have received their first two vaccine doses, according to CDC data. Out of those people, about half have gotten their third shot. It's also not clear how effective the new omicron boosters will be in the real world yet. The Food and Drug Administration authorized the shots on Wednesday without results from human trials on the BA.5 shots. But Dr. Peter Marks, head of the FDA office responsible for reviewing vaccines, said the available data suggests the shots will provide substantially better protection. Public health officials are working under the assumption that the U.S. will face some version of omicron in the fall, which is why the new vaccines target BA.5. But there is always the risk that a new variant outside the omicron lineage will emerge that can evade the new shots. If Covid mutates in a way that gives life to a new, dominant variant and boosters are slow to get out to the public, the U.S. could suffer 1.3 million hospitalizations and 181,000 deaths over the next nine months, according to the scientists' most pessimistic scenario. But Michael Osterholm, director of Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said the reality is that nobody really knows what will happen in the fall. \"We don't know,\" he said. Ali Mokdad, an epidemiologist at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, said his group is predicting a rise in Covid cases, deaths and hospitalizations this fall. \"But the rise in mortality and hospitalization will not be similar to what we have seen before, simply because most people have some kind of immunity against illness,\" Mokdad said. About 95% of people ages 16 and older in the U.S., in fact, have Covid antibodies of some sort \u2014 either from vaccination or prior infection, according to a CDC survey of blood donor data. This means more people in the U.S. have at least some protection against severe disease and death from Covid than at any other point in the pandemic. Previous infection, vaccination alone and vaccination plus infection didn't necessarily keep people from getting sick, but they all showed more than 70% effectiveness against developing a really severe case or dying from omicron BA.2 , according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine by Weill Cornell Medicine in Qatar. The study examined the medical records of 100,000 individuals in Qatar from December 2021 through February 2022. But the Qatar study may not translate well to the U.S. population, which has a large elderly population and many people with preexisting medical conditions, like obesity or diabetes. Qatar on the other hand has a very young population \u2014 only 9% of its residents are age 50 or older compared with more than a third of all Americans. Omicron has also continued to evolve into more transmissible and immune-evasive subvariants. The BA.5 subvariant became dominant this summer, pushing out BA.2. Though BA.5 has not been associated with more severe disease, it is more effective at evading immunity and infecting people who are vaccinated or who have recovered from Covid. \"BA.5 is the most contagious, certainly the most immune evasive variant we've seen,\" Jha told NBC News in July. \"That means if you were infected earlier this you're still at very high risk of reinfection. It means if you've not been vaccinated recently you have a very high risk of having a breakthrough.\" While the CDC previously thought that infection provided about 90 days of protection, Jha told reporters in July that breakthrough infections have become more common and are happening earlier with BA.5. He said it's unclear how long immunity lasts after recovering from a BA.5 infection. Osterholm said the pandemic has entered another unprecedented period. Previously, infections have surged to high peaks and then steeply declined before the next wave. But for the past three months, infections, hospitalizations and deaths have plateaued at a high level with no sign of another variant displacing BA.5, he said. \"We're seeing now more and more people are on their second and third episodes of this,\" Osterholm said. \"What is the interaction between increasing vaccination, natural infection and immunity related to infection? We just don't know,\" he said. It's unclear whether the current pattern of transmission will continue or if the U.S. will face another wave, Osterholm said. Right now, the U.S. is averaging more than 88,000 new infections daily, which is likely a vast undercount because people testing positive at home isn't picked up by the official data. More than 32,000 people total are hospitalized across the U.S. with Covid right now, and an average of nearly 400 people are still dying every day from the virus, according to data from the CDC and the Health and Human Services Department. That's a significant improvement from the peak of the outbreak in the winter of 2021 when more than 3,000 people died a day on average. Though milder today than those early days of the pandemic, Covid is still killing at four or five times the fatality rate of the flu, Jha told the Chamber. \"If everybody was up to date on their vaccines and people got treated with Paxlovid as they're supposed to deaths would go to close to zero across America,\" Jha said. Hospitalizations are down 75% and deaths are down 85% from the peak of last winter's omicron surge. But if deaths remain at their current level through next year, more than 140,000 people would succumb to the virus, which would still make Covid one of the 10 leading causes of death in the U.S. \"Will we continue to see this kind of activity maintained for some time? People will say it can't go on endlessly because people will be infected and develop immunity. But what happens with waning immunity?\" Osterholm said. Many elderly people and individuals with weak immune systems remain vulnerable to the virus. The rate of hospitalization and death from Covid has increased among those ages 65 and older since April despite high levels of vaccination in this age group, according to CDC data. Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at the Brown University School of Public Health, said she is worried about the elderly and those with weak immune systems who are not up to date on their vaccines heading into the fall. Nuzzo said the public health response this fall should be laser focused on making sure these people are protected. \"I have some worry that unless we put that at the top of our list, our efforts are just going to be diluted, spread out over a number of different areas,\" Nuzzo said. \"If we fail to make sure the highest-risk people are fully protected, that's when we're going to see the deaths and that's the most important thing we could try to prevent.\" Although 92% of those ages 65 and older received the first two doses of the vaccine, many of them have not stayed up to date with their boosters. About 70% received their third dose and only 40% have gotten their fourth shot since the FDA authorized it in February. People ages 50 and older who received a second booster dose were 14 times less likely to die from Covid than the unvaccinated, and three times less likely to die than people who had one booster dose, according to CDC data. Dr. Paul Offit, an infectious disease expert at Children's Hospital Philadelphia, said people ages 75 and older, people with serious medical conditions and those with compromised immune systems would benefit the most from getting a booster right now. Deaths from Covid have risen in particular among people ages 75 and older, according to the CDC. The CDC has also emphasized the importance of using therapeutics to protect people who simply cannot mount a strong immune response to the virus even with vaccination. Nearly 3% of U.S. adults have compromised immune systems, or about 7 million people ages 18 or older, according a survey published in 2016 in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The CDC has emphasized the importance of administering an investigational antibody therapy called Evusheld for people ages 12 and older with moderate and severely compromised immune systems. Evusheld is administered as two injections, before Covid infection, every six months to prevent severe illness, according to the FDA. But only 450,000 courses of the medicine have been administered so far, according to the Health and Human Services Department. \"The goal moving forward here for this year, next year, five years and 10 years down the road is protecting the vulnerable,\" Offit said."},

It is the first time the FDA has authorized an updated vaccine formula since the original shots rolled out in December 2020. Pharmacies are expected to start administering the new boosters after Labor Day weekend. The U.S. has secured 171 million doses of Pfizer's and Moderna's updated shots so far, according to the Health and Human Services Department. Pfizer's new booster dose is authorized for people ages 12 and older, while Moderna's new shots are authorized for adults ages 18 and older. The eligible age groups can receive the boosters two months after completing their primary series or their most recent booster with the old shots. The U.S. will no longer use the original vaccines as booster doses for individuals ages 12 and older now that the the updated shots have been authorized, according to the FDA. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has to sign off on the boosters before pharmacies can give them to patients. The CDC's independent advisory committee is scheduled to meet Thursday and Friday to review the data and issue its recommendations for health-care providers. Public health officials believe the redesigned boosters will provide longer-lasting protection against the virus and reduce hospitalizations this fall and winter. The new boosters target both the original strain that emerged in China more than two years ago, which scientists refer to as the \"wild type,\" and omicron BA.4 and BA.5, which are now the dominant variants in the U.S. Shots that target two different strains are called bivalent vaccines. The vaccine makers developed the original shots against the strain of Covid that first emerged in Wuhan, China, in 2019. But the virus has mutated dramatically since then. Omicron and its subvariants have drifted so much from the original Covid strain that the virus is able to slip past the protective antibodies induced by the vaccines. As a consequence, the shots' effectiveness at preventing infection and mild illness has declined substantially as the virus has evolved. Though the vaccines are still generally preventing severe disease, the protection they provide against hospitalization has slipped over time as well. \"There is declining effectiveness against hospitalization and severe illness. The problem has been persuading the American people to get boosted on a regular basis,\" said Dr. Peter Hotez, an infectious disease expert at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas. Hotez led a team that developed a Covid vaccine based on protein technology that is authorized in India. About 76% of people ages 12 and older have received their first two vaccine doses in the U.S., according to CDC data. About 50% of those individuals have received their first booster dose. For adults ages 18 and older, three doses of Pfizer's or Moderna's original vaccines were 55% effective at preventing hospitalization from the omicron BA.2 subvariant four months after the third shot, according to CDC data. Three shots were 19% effective at preventing infection from omicron five months after the third shot, according to CDC data from August 2021 through May 2022. The rapidly spreading BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants have since driven omicron BA.2 out of circulation. Dr. Peter Marks, head of the FDA office responsible for reviewing vaccines, said the hope is that the updated boosters will restore the high level of protection against disease that vaccines demonstrated when they were first authorized in December 2020. \"We don't know for a fact yet whether we will get to that same level, but that is the goal here. And that is what we believe the evidence that we've seen helps point to,\" Marks told reporters during a news conference after the authorization Wednesday. The Biden administration moved rapidly over the summer to get updated shots ready for the fall. Public health officials are worried the U.S. is on the verge of another wave of infection as more transmissible omicron variants spread, immunity from the original vaccines wears off, and people head indoors to escape colder weather. Pfizer and Moderna were originally developing boosters to target omicron BA.1, the variant that caused the massive wave of infection last winter. But the FDA told the vaccine makers in late June to switch gears and target BA.4 and BA.5 instead as those variants quickly gained ground. The sudden change in plans left little time for clinical trials in humans before a fall rollout. As a consequence, the authorization is based on human clinical trials from the BA.1 shots, which produced a better immune response than the original doses, according to the FDA. But it's unclear how the BA.5 boosters will perform in humans since the data is based on BA.1. Marks said it will likely be at least another two months before human clinical data on the BA.5 shots is made available to the public. The most common side effects from the human trials of the BA.1 shots was pain, redness, swelling at the injection site, fatigue, headaches, muscle pain, joint pain, chills, nausea, vomiting and fever, according to the FDA. The Covid vaccines also have a well-established safety profile after administration to millions of people over the course of the pandemic, the FDA said. In addition to human data from the BA.1 shots, the authorization was also based on animal studies from the BA.5 boosters, Marks said. In June, Pfizer also presented data to the FDA's independent vaccine advisory committee that showed the bivalent omicron BA.5 shots increased antibodies in mice that protect against infection by about 2.6-fold compared with the original vaccine. Marks said the FDA used the same process for the authorization that it relied on in the past for switching the strains in flu vaccines. \"We're pretty confident that or what we have is very similar to the situation that we've done in the past with influenza changes where we don't do clinical studies for them in the United States,\" Marks said. \"We know from the way the vaccine works, and from the data that we have, that we can predict how well the vaccine will be working.\" But some infectious disease and vaccine experts say the FDA should have waited for human data from the BA.5 shots before authorizing them. Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the FDA's advisory committee, said data based on mice studies is not sufficient to justify authorizing the new boosters. \"You have to show some evidence in people that the immune response that you're getting with the bivalent vaccine is clearly better, and those data haven't been presented,\" said Offit, an infectious disease and vaccine expert at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. \"You can't ask millions of people to get this booster dose without showing some human data that you have a dramatic increase in neutralizing antibodies to the BA.4/BA.5 strains as compared to boosting with the ancestral type,\" Offit said, referring to the currently authorized shots based on the version of Covid that emerged in China, more than two years ago. Michael Osterholm, a leading epidemiologist and director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, also said more data needs to be presented on how the BA.5 shots perform in humans. \"It's not that I don't think it could work,\" Osterholm said. \"But I think we need the data first to show that the immune response to this vaccine is equivalent to or better than what we have already.\" But CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky, in a radio interview, said waiting longer for human data from the BA.5 shots could mean the boosters become outdated if a new variant emerges. Walensky said the change in the vaccine formula is small and should not affect safety. \"There's always a question here of being too slow versus too fast,\" Walensky told \"Conversations on Health Care\" in a radio interview. \"One of the challenges is if we wait for those data to emerge in human data [...] we will be using what I would consider to be a potentially outdated vaccine.\""},

The agency's independent committee on vaccines voted 13 to 1 earlier Thursday in favor of the shots after reviewing the available safety and effectiveness data over an almost seven-hour-long meeting. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky signed off on the shots a few hours later, clearing the way for pharmacies to soon start administering the shots. Pfizer 's omicron boosters were OKed for people ages 12 and older, while Moderna 's updated shots were authorized for people ages 18 and older. The eligible age groups can receive the boosters at least two months after completing their primary series or their most recent booster with the old shots. Walensky said her decision followed \"a comprehensive scientific evaluation and robust scientific discussion.\" \"If you are eligible, there is no bad time to get your Covid-19 booster and I strongly encourage you to receive it,\" she said in a statement. Pfizer plans to ask the Food and Drug Administration to also authorize the new boosters for children ages 5 to 11 years old in early October, company executives told the committee Thursday. The original vaccines will no longer be used as a booster in people ages 12 and older now that the reformulated shots are coming online. Public health officials are expecting another wave of Covd infection this fall as immunity from the old vaccines wanes off, more contagious omicron subvariants spread, and people spend more time indoors as the weather turns colder and families gather for the holidays. The CDC and the FDA hope the new boosters will provide more durable protection against infection, mild illness and severe disease. The reformulated shots target omicron BA.5, the dominant variant of Covid as well as the strain that emerged in China more than two years ago. The U.S so far has secured 171 million doses of Pfizer's and Moderna's new boosters. More than 200 million people are eligible for the shots, according to the CDC. Dr. Sara Oliver, a CDC official, told the committee Thursday that there should be enough supply of the vaccine to meet demand this fall. There is no data from human trials on the new BA.5 boosters, so it's unclear how they will perform in the real world. The CDC and FDA used human data from clinical trials for shots targeting the original version of omicron, BA.1, which triggered a stronger immune response than the old vaccines. Pfizer and Moderna were originally developing omicron boosters to target BA.1, but the FDA asked the companies to switch gears in June and develop BA.5 shots instead after the subvariant became dominant. The decision to focus on BA.5 did not leave enough time to wait for data from human trials ahead of a fall vaccine rollout. The lack of human data for the BA.5 shots has caused some controversy, but Dr. Peter Marks, a senior FDA official, said the agency followed the same process used for years with strain changes for flu vaccines. Marks said on Wednesday that flu vaccine strains are also changed without human clinical data. Dr. Pablo Sanchez, the only committee member who voted against the shots, called the recommendation premature and said the U.S. should have waited for human data before proceeding with the boosters. \"There's a lot of vaccine hesitancy already \u2014 we need the human data,\" said Sanchez, a professor of pediatrics at Ohio State University. But Sanchez said he believes the new boosters are safe and he will likely receive one himself. Panel member Dr. Oliver Brooks, chief medical officer at Watts HealthCare Corporation in Los Angeles, questioned why the FDA decided to go with a BA.5 vaccine when clinical data is available for the BA.1 shots that the vaccine makers were originally developing. Brooks ended up voting in favor the shots. But Dr. Sarah Long, also a committee member, said there's no reason to expect the BA.5 boosters will be inferior to the old shots since they also include the original Covid strain, and they have potential to reduce hospitalizations and deaths heading into the fall and winter. Long also voted in favor. Officials at the FDA and CDC have said the omicron BA.1 and omicron BA.5 boosters are similar enough that the immune response data from the BA.1 shot should give a good indication of how the BA.5 shots will perform. Omicron BA.1 and BA.5 are closely related with a four-mutation difference, according to Dr. Jacqueline Miller, who works on vaccine development at Moderna. Moderna completed enrollment in clinical trials on the BA.5 shots last week and should have results by the end of the year, Miller told the CDC committee on Thursday. Pfizer's clinical trial is also ongoing, though company hasn't said when it expects results. The health agencies also reviewed data on the BA.5 shots from mouse studies. Moderna presented data showing that the BA.5 shots increased antibodies in mice more than fourfold compared with the old shots. The mice express the same cell protein as humans that the virus latches onto. Pfizer's BA.5 booster increased antibodies 2.6 fold in mice compared with the original vaccine. The most common side effects from the human trials of the BA.1 shots was pain, redness, swelling at the injection site, fatigue, headaches, muscle pain, joint pain, chills, nausea, vomiting and fever, according to the FDA. Oliver, the CDC official, told the committee that health officials do not expect any difference in the safety profile of the BA.1 and BA.5 shots given that subvariants differ only by a few mutations. But Oliver noted that the risk of myocarditis following a BA.5 booster shot is unknown. There is an elevated risk of myocarditis among young men and adolescent boys following the second dose of Pfizer's and Moderna's shots but the risk of myocarditis from Covid infection is higher, according to the CDC. \"We know that the myocarditis risk is unknown but anticipate a similar risk to that seen after the monovalent vaccines,\" Oliver said. The monovalent vaccines are the old shots that have been administered to millions of people in the U.S. over the past two years. The original vaccines, which were first authorized in December 2020, are no longer providing meaningful protection against infection because the virus has mutated so much over the past two years. The shots were developed against the first strain that emerged in China, so they are no longer matched to target the omicron subvariants that are spreading. Infections, hospitalizations and deaths have declined dramatically since the massive wave of omicron infection last winter, but have plateaued this summer at a stubbornly high level. Omicron BA.5 is the most contagious and immune evasive variant yet, and breakthrough infections have become increasingly common as a consequence. The old vaccines effectiveness against hospitalization also declined after omicron BA.5 became dominant. A third dose was 77% effective at prevention hospitalization four months after receiving the shot, but protection declined after 120 day to as low as 34%, according to CDC data. A fourth dose in people ages 50 and older was 56% effective at preventing hospitalization after four months. Deaths and hospitalizations from Covid among people ages 65 and older have increased since April, according to Heather Scobie, a CDC epidemiologist who presented data during Thursday's meeting. Deaths have risen in particular among people ages 75 and older, Scobie said. The CDC has shifted to a more targeted public health response with an emphasis on protecting the most vulnerable \u2014 the elderly, people with serious medical conditions and those who have weak immune systems. Although there's no data on the real-world effectiveness of the new boosters, the U.S. is moving rapidly to roll them out in the hope that they will protect people this fall."},

But booking airfare on a certain day of the week isn't one of them, according to data from Google Flights. Booking mid-week \u2014 and especially Tuesdays around midnight \u2014 is often cited as the best time to purchase flights. But in the past five years, U.S. airfares purchased on Tuesdays, Wednesday or Thursdays have been only 1.9% cheaper on average than airfares purchased during the weekend, according to Google Flights. \"If your trip is just a couple of weeks away, don't wait for Tuesday to roll around \u2014 book your flight now in case the price goes up,\" wrote James Byers, Google Flights' group product manager, on a blog post published yesterday. While the day of the week travelers book may not matter much, the day they fly does, according to Google Flights' research, which examined five years of historical flight data from Aug. 1, 2017 to Aug. 1, 2022. \"On average, flights that depart on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday have been 12% cheaper than weekend departures,\" wrote Byers. \"If you exclude international destinations, the potential savings jump even higher to 20%.\" Another common strategy \u2014 booking early \u2014 also works, according to the data. For U.S. domestic flights, airfares have been lowest between three and eight weeks before a departure date, with prices \"bottoming out\" 44 days out, according to the research. Non-stop flights cost on average about 20% more than connecting flights, according to Google Flights, but flights with stops also increase the risk of interruptions. An Instagram poll by the travel insurance company World Nomads indicated more than 1 in 3 respondents spent up to $250 on flights, meals or hotels because of flight delays or cancellations this summer, while 12% reported spending between $500 to $1,000. Travelers with flexible flying days can use Google Flights' \"date grid\" function to quickly ascertain the cheapest dates to depart and arrive in a given week. Those who want to travel for a specific duration \u2014 say, two weeks \u2014 but are flexible on when, can use the \"price graph\" function to see the cheapest times to fly too. Price tracking also eliminates the need to search again and again to price-check a desired route. Search the route once, hit the button to \"track prices\" and Google Flights will send notifications of airfare changes via email. Based on its historical data, Google Flights also suggests the \"best times\" to book flights for peak-period travel and popular routes.

Explaining its decision, the company \u2014 one of several in England and Wales to have announced water usage limits in recent weeks \u2014 said extreme temperatures and this summer's heatwave had resulted in the highest demand for water in more than 25 years. \"The driest July since 1885, the hottest temperatures on record, and the River Thames reaching its lowest level since 2005 have led to a drop in reservoir levels in the Thames Valley and London,\" it said. The TUB does not apply to businesses, although Thames Water said it was asking those within its area \"to be mindful of the drought and to use water wisely.\" This could involve companies switching off water features on their premises and not washing their vehicles, it suggested. \"Implementing a Temporary Use Ban for our customers has been a very difficult decision to make and one which we have not taken lightly,\" Sarah Bentley, the Thames Water CEO, said. \"After months of below average rainfall and the recent extreme temperatures in July and August, water resources in our region are depleted,\" Bentley added. The announcement of the ban comes at a time when many water companies are facing criticism related to leaks from their pipes. For its part, Thames Water said it had teams focused on locating and fixing more than 1,100 leaks per week. When it comes to enforcement of the ban, the firm said it hoped and expected customers to continue using water wisely. \"If we become aware of customers ignoring the restrictions, we'll contact them to make sure they're aware of the rules and how to use water responsibly and wisely,\" it added. \"There are criminal offences for those that repeatedly ignore requests to comply with the ban.\" Last month saw temperatures in the U.K. surge, with highs of over 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) recorded for the first time ever. On Aug. 12, the U.K.'s Environment Agency announced that parts of England had moved into drought status. \"In drought affected areas the public and businesses should be very mindful of the pressures on water resources and should use water wisely,\" authorities said. They added that government expected water firms \"to act to reduce leakage and fix leaking pipes as quickly as possible and take wider action alongside government policy.\" The U.K. is not alone when it comes to drought-related issues. On July 18, the European Commission's Joint Research Centre published a report looking at drought in Europe. \"The severe drought affecting several regions of Europe since the beginning of the year continues expanding and worsening,\" it said. \"Dry conditions are related to a wide and persistent lack of precipitation combined with early heatwaves in May and June.\" In an interview with CNBC earlier this week, Bill Hare, CEO and senior scientist at research non-profit Climate Analytics, explained how the current conditions were having wide-ranging effects. \"On the water supply, it's clear that in the U.K. and other parts of Europe, we're seeing already very significant water stress that's beginning to affect \u2026 ordinary urban residents, not just farmers,\" he said. \"We're seeing the lack of availability for cooling water for thermal, nuclear or coal power stations, which is causing curtailment of power,\" Hare, who was speaking to CNBC's Joumanna Bercetche, said. \"This is a problem we're seeing all over the world,\" he added. \"We're seeing, also, issues for example in Germany, now in the Danube region, with low water flow, meaning you can't carry cargo anymore.\" This was in turn, \"having big implications not just for the transport of energy, but for agriculture, all manner of industrial commodities and so on.\""},

Toyota Battery Manufacturing North Carolina is set to start operations in 2025, with the firm stating that total investment in the plant will now amount to $3.8 billion. Norm Bafunno, who is senior vice president, unit manufacturing and engineering at Toyota Motor North America, said the announcement marked \"another significant milestone\" for the business. The additional investment in the U.S. is part of a wider investment of up to $5.6 billion in battery production, with Toyota noting that demand for battery electric vehicles was growing. To this end, the business said it would aim to ramp up \"combined battery production capacity\" in the U.S. and Japan by as much as 40 gigawatt hours. As well as diesel and gasoline vehicles, Toyota is known for its hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell offerings. It is also attempting to make headway in the increasingly competitive battery-electric market, where firms like Tesla and Volkswagen are jostling for position. This has not been without its challenges. In June 2022, Toyota issued a safety recall for more than 2,000 of its all-electric SUV, the bZ4X. Toyota may be looking to invest billions in EV battery production, but on Wednesday the business stressed it would also \"continue to make every effort to flexibly meet the needs\" of customers \"in all countries and regions by offering multiple powertrains and providing as many options as possible.\" Indeed, the website of Toyota Europe states that the \"internal combustion engine continues to be the most popular means of powering vehicles and it will continue to play a role for the next 20 to 30 years.\" All the above comes at a time when major economies are laying out plans to reduce the environmental footprint of road-based transportation. Just this month, the California Air Resources Board approved a rule that will require all new car sales in the state to be zero emission by the year 2035. Elsewhere, the U.K. wants to stop the sale of new diesel and gasoline cars and vans by 2030. It will require, from 2035, all new cars and vans to have zero-tailpipe emissions. The European Union \u2014 which the U.K. left on Jan. 31, 2020 \u2014 is pursuing similar targets. According to the International Energy Agency, electric vehicle sales hit 6.6 million in 2021.

The group posted a copy of the emails online later Thursday. The report comes more than a month after Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., said the select House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, pro-Trump riot at the U.S. Capitol was considering issuing a subpoena to Ginni Thomas. Thomas sent the emails to Arizona and Wisconsin lawmakers via the online site FreeRoots, which provides pre-written messages that can be sent to multiple elected officials. Arizona and Wisconsin sent Biden electors to the Electoral College, as he won the popular vote in both states. The Electoral College then named him the winner of the 2020 vote. A lawyer for Thomas and a spokeswoman for the Supreme Court did not immediately respond to requests for comment from CNBC about her emails. Thomas' advocacy for conservative causes while her husband serves on the high court has generated controversy in recent years. Thomas sent 29 messages to Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows after the 2020 election encouraging him to pursue then-ongoing efforts to undo Biden's victory, CBS News reported in March. \"Help This Great President stand firm, Mark!!! ...You are the leader, with him, who is standing for America's constitutional governance at the precipice,\" she wrote Meadows on Nov. 10, 2020. \"The majority knows Biden and the Left is attempting the greatest Heist of our History.\" Several efforts to effectively overturn Trump's losses in battleground states ended up at the Supreme Court after the election. None of those efforts succeeded. In January, Clarence Thomas was the only Supreme Court justice to support Trump's request to block White House records from being sent to the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 riot. That riot began after Trump and his allies falsely claimed for weeks that he had actually won the presidential election and that Biden's victory was the result of widespread ballot fraud in states that included Arizona and Wisconsin. The violence disrupted a joint session of Congress for hours as lawmakers gathered to confirm Biden's Electoral College win."},

The economy saw growth in all the key sectors and subsectors in August, led by a gain of 68,000 jobs in professional and business services. \"The market will like the broad-based gains in jobs as both goods-producing and services jobs rose in August,\" said Jeffrey Roach, the chief economist for LPL Financial. The strongest areas within professional and business services include computer systems design, management and technical consulting, and architectural and engineering. The sector has now added 1.1 million jobs over the past 12 months, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Health care came in second for the month, with 48,200 jobs added. If health-care jobs were added to education and social services, as some economists do, that broad sector would have matched the 68,000 gain by professional and business services. Retail trade was another bright spot, growing by 44,000 jobs. That was an acceleration from the 29,100 jobs added in July. Even though job growth was positive across the board, it was significantly slower in some areas. Leisure and hospitality, for example, added 31,000 jobs in August after growing by 95,000 in July. The sector is still 1.2 million short of its pre-pandemic level. Transportation and warehousing added just 4,800 jobs after growing by more than 24,000 in July. Roach also pointed to a rise in part-time workers by 225,000, with 69,000 saying they could not find full-time employment, as a potential area of concern going forward."},

Meanwhile, Black workers marked the only demographic to see their labor force participation fall. The unemployment rate rose 0.2 percentage point to 3.7% in August, according to data released Friday by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Nonfarm payrolls came in at 315,000 and fell in line with estimates of 318,000. While all demographic groups saw the unemployment rate tick up slightly, it rose at a sharper pace for both Hispanic and Black workers to 4.5% and 6.4%, respectively, from 3.9% and 6% in July. However, Black workers marked the only group that saw labor force participation decline, while the group's employment-population ratio, which measures what percentage of the population holds a job, also fell. \"There is some volatility in these numbers but seeing a downward trend in employment and participation is worrisome,\" said Elise Gould, senior economist with the Economic Policy Institute. For August, Black labor force participation fell to 61.8% from 62% in July, while the employment to population ratio dipped to 57.9% from 58.3% William Spriggs, chief economist to the AFL-CIO, said that looking at Black workers is one way to gauge and understand what's really happening among employers. Black workers across the board face more discrimination than many other groups, which could be one explanation, he said. A potential slowdown in hiring \u2014 as evident through this week's ADP private payrolls data \u2014 could also be a contributor to these results. \"When firms slow their hiring rate, that hit Black workers immediately because they're already in line the longest to try and find a job,\" Spriggs said. \"What's happened is the queue's just gotten longer so the discouraged worker effect is much more acute for Black workers. While it's too early to assign a specific cause to the declining labor force participation among Black workers, Gould said the continued downward trend in recent months may signal something other than \"a statistical anomaly.\" That said, the Federal Reserve's campaign to quickly raise rates to tame surging prices may be causing more damage to the labor market, which tends to appear among historically disadvantaged groups like Black workers. \"Black workers are beginning to feel the brunt of it in a disparate fashion,\" said Michelle Holder, a distinguished senior fellow at Washington Center for Equitable Growth. \"Now, this is one report, but I pretty much believe that this is going to be the pattern over the next few months, particularly if the Fed continues to aggressively implement its approach.\" Like others, Holder agrees that it's too early to attribute a cause to the decline in Black labor force participation, but called attention to rising unemployment among Black female workers. The group saw its unemployment rate rise from 5.3% in July to 5.9%. In comparison, white female workers saw their unemployment rate tick up to 2.8% from 2.6%. Hispanic female workers also experienced a sharp increase in their unemployment rate, rising to 4.3% from 3.2% in July. While the unemployment rate did rise at a faster clip among Hispanic workers compared to white workers and the overall jobs market, the group's labor force participation rate and employment trend seem to mimic the broader market, Gould said. \"We're seeing this rise in unemployment as accompanied by a significant increase in participation and then uptake as well in employment,\" she said. \"I think that's a hopeful sign. The fact that the unemployment rate moves up is not a troubling thing on its own.\" \u2014 CNBC's Gabriel Cortes contributed to this report."},

The president's remarks came after Idaho-based microchip manufacturer Micron announced plans Thursday to invest approximately $15 billion over the next decade in a new memory manufacturing facility in Boise. The lab, which is the first of its kind built in America in over 20 years, is projected to create 17,000 new American jobs by the end of 2032, according to the company. \"Today's announcement by Micron is another big win for America,\" Biden said in a statement. Micron President and CEO Sanjay Mehrotra thanked the Biden administration and members of Congress for bipartisan support of the CHIPS Act \"which made this investment decision possible.\" \"This is the first of Micron's multiple planned U.S. investments following the passage of the CHIPS and Science Act, and represents the largest private investment ever made in Idaho,\" Mehrotra said in a statement. \"Our new leading-edge memory manufacturing fab will fuel U.S. technology leadership, ensuring a reliable domestic supply of semiconductors that is critical to economic and national security.\" Over $52 billion was allotted to U.S. companies producing computer chips under the act, along with billions in tax credits to spur investments in semiconductor manufacturing to enable the U.S. to compete with East Asia. The region accounts for 75% of global production of semiconductors. Biden signed the CHIPS Act into law in early August. Micron first announced a $40 billion investment in memory chip manufacturing at that time. The investment, said the White House, will create 40,000 new jobs in construction and manufacturing and raise the U.S. market share of memory chip production from less than 2% to up to 10% over the next 10 years. In his statement Thursday, Biden also mentioned similar growth projections from manufacturing companies First Solar, Toyota, Honda and Corning over the past week. The announcements are a \"direct result of my economic plan,\" he said. Solar power company First Solar announced $1.2 billion in developments Tuesday, including a new factory in the southeastern part of the country and an expansion of its Northwest Ohio manufacturing footprint. The investments will add at least 850 new manufacturing jobs with the additional goal of supporting over 15,000 jobs by 2025, according to a press release. Vehicle manufacturers Toyota and Honda revealed a respective $2.5 billion additional investment in Toyota's North American battery manufacturing facility and a $4.4 billion joint venture with LG Energy Solutions to manufacture lithium-ion batteries in the U.S. that will power Honda and Acura EV models for the domestic market. Toyota's new venture will add 350 jobs, bringing total employment to approximately 2,100, according to a statement. A representative for Honda did not respond to a request for comment before publication. Corning, a New York-based advanced optics manufacturer, said Tuesday it is partnering with AT&T in a new optical cable manufacturing facility in Arizona. The facility will bring approximately 250 jobs to the area and is expected to open in 2024, according to a press release. \"In our future, we will make EVs, chips, fiber optics, and other critical components here in America, and we will have an economy built from the bottom up and middle out,\" Biden said Thursday. The economy has added 3.3 million jobs this year as the unemployment rate has fallen to 3.5%, tied for the lowest since 1969. For August, payrolls growth is expected to rise by 318,000 after growing by 528,000 in July. However, Federal Reserve officials have warned that their intentions to continue raising interest rates to combat inflation could raise the level of unemployment in the months ahead. \u2014 CNBC's Jeff Cox contributed to this article."},

Situated roughly 89 kilometers (approximately 55 miles) off the coast of Yorkshire, England, the scale of Hornsea 2 is considerable. According to Orsted, it has a capacity of more than 1.3 gigawatts and stretches across an area of 462 square kilometers \u2014 more than half the size of New York City. Hornsea 2, it added, uses Siemens Gamesa turbines with blades measuring 81 meters, or more than 265 feet. \"One revolution of the wind turbine blades can power an average UK home for 24 hours,\" the company says. It is the latest step forward for the Hornsea 2 project, which generated its first power in Dec. 2021. The development comes as European countries attempt to wean themselves off Russian fossil fuels, including gas, following the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine in February. \"Current global events highlight more than ever the importance of landmark renewable energy projects like Hornsea 2, helping the UK increase the security and resilience of its energy supply and drive down costs for consumers by reducing dependence on expensive fossil fuels,\" said Duncan Clark, head of the U.K. region at Orsted. The U.K. is home to a mature offshore wind sector that looks set to expand in the coming years, with authorities aiming for up to 50 GW of capacity by 2030. The European Union, which the U.K. left in January 2020, has previously laid out a 300 GW target for offshore wind by the middle of this century. Across the Atlantic, the U.S. has a long way to go to catch up with Europe. America's first offshore wind facility, the 30 megawatt Block Island Wind Farm, only started commercial operations in late 2016. Change is coming, however, and in Nov. 2021 ground was broken on a project dubbed the United States' \"first commercial scale offshore wind farm.\""},

Here are their stories. Job: Emmy-award winning TV host of \" Samantha Brown's Places to Love\"\nStarted in: Comedy \" I went to Syracuse University for musical theater because I so desperately wanted to move to New York City and become a thespian. I wanted to do Shakespeare and be on Broadway. That didn't pan out. I waited on tables for a good eight years. But I loved improv, and I was a part of an improv comedy troupe. So I just kept auditioning for jobs. A writer recommended me to a production company that was \u2026 looking for a host. But my audition for it had to be totally improvised. That's how I got the job. When you are a travel host, there's no script. Yet it is still up to you to define the scene, to understand the trajectory of a story and how to end it. Also in improv, the golden rule is to never say no, it's always yes \u2014 to keep things going. Waiting on tables in New York City for eight years, you start to be really humbled, [but] those were the tools that I had that got me a job that I never in my wildest dreams thought I would ever have.\" Job: Creator of \" Strictly Dumpling\" and other YouTube channels (total: about 8 million subscribers)\nStarted in: Accounting and wedding videography \"I moved to the U.S. from China when I was 8 years old. My parents started working in restaurants, and eventually started their own very Americanized Chinese restaurant. So I grew up on a steady diet of General Tso's chicken and crab rangoon. There wasn't a lot of diversity where I'm from, but it helped that my parents sent me back to China when I was 13. Most people get grounded and sent to their room as a punishment \u2014 I got sent to China for two years. That's when I was like: Wow, it's so amazing \u2014 the people, the history \u2014 I want to know more. After college, I went to New York and worked on Wall Street for a year. Then I became a wedding videographer because I wanted to be flexible. I was living in a small basement apartment in Brooklyn with no air conditioning, making about $400 \u2014 on a good week. But this was the first time I was eating something that wasn't Red Lobster and Olive Garden. I got a taste of diverse ethnic food in Chinatown, and I started to discover a lot of my heritage that I never really saw as important before. I started recording food videos on YouTube as a food diary for myself. I remember having a conversation with a friend that food content will never amount to anything. There wasn't anybody online doing it. I had like 10 subscribers. Somehow it grew to this, which was never expected. I never really had much money growing up \u2014 or throughout most of my adulthood. So I was always looking for things that were inexpensive but also really filling and delicious. And that's pretty much what I do around the world now.\" Job: Television host of \" Family Travel with Colleen Kelly\"\nStarted in: Sales \"I tried out for the broadcast school at the University of Texas. The school gave you one chance to be accepted into the program. I had never sat at an anchor desk with a camera pointed at me. I failed miserably. Several years later, I graduated and got my first job in sales, eventually moving to Chicago and working in the pharmaceutical industry. The money was amazing, and I had a company car. But I wasn't living my dream, and this started to really bother me. In my early 30s, I got married and eventually quit my job to be a stay-at-home mom. One day, when my two little girls were in school, I went to our town hall's cable TV station and asked if, in exchange for teaching me how to edit, I could host the local entertainment show about our village \u2014 something like \"Access Hollywood\" for our 50,000-resident town. Because they had no other offers, they said yes. I acted confident, but I was as green as they come. I was shaking in my boots every time I did an interview and read voice-over, but I was gaining experience and knowledge. I confided in another mom that my dream was to host a national travel show, and, surprisingly, she agreed to produce it with me. We wrote a script, found a local camera guy for a few dollars and made a pilot. I took meetings with two major companies \u2014 both said no. I was told by one network that women don't watch travel shows, so the concept of family travel didn't appeal to them. I then sent thousands of emails to television stations. Nothing worked. Finally, my mother suggested I call the local PBS station. I googled the head of programming, called him (no emails) and got a meeting. After more meetings, we learned PBS was picking two shows to go national, and \"Family Travel with Colleen Kelly\" was one of them. We scraped by for a year, producing 13 episodes that first season. Now, the show has been on for more than 10 years. And, the best part is that I can bring my family with me. It's been a long and arduous journey, but I hope this story inspires others to believe in themselves, ignore the naysayers, and never give up on their dream.\" Editor's note: These interviews have been edited for length and clarity."},

It's not clear if that will last", "paragraphs": " The pace of new monkeypox cases reported in some major cities -- and in the US overall -- has started to slow recently, but experts say it's too early to know if the trend will last. On Friday, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said that she is \"cautiously optimistic\" about the downward trend, but warned that the overall case count is still growing. \"The rate of rise is lower, but we are still seeing increases and we are of course a very diverse country and things are not even across the country. So, we're watching this with cautious optimism,\" she said. Last week, there were an average of 337 new cases of monkeypox reported each day in the US, according to . That's a 24% drop from two weeks earlier -- a difference of more than 100 cases a day. A few factors are \"working together to bend the curve,\" Walensky said, including vaccination, behavior changes and harm reduction messages \"being heard and implemented.\" But many more factors are still in flux, leaving questions unanswered. Local health departments say they are working hard to understand the factors driving case trends. Washington, DC, has been an epicenter of the outbreak since the beginning; the city has had nearly 12 times more cases per capita than the country overall. The local health department has seen a \"slight decrease\" in cases over the past week, but said that \"education and vaccines\" are two key factors that will drive trends going forward. And \"with 100,000 students that will return to DC within the next week, it is too early to project the trends,\" they said. The California health department said that state trends over the last several weeks suggest \"stabilizing rather than increasing transmission levels\" and daily cases \"leveling off.\" \"The trend could continue but will depend on vaccination and behavior change as noted previously,\" they said. New York City Health Commissioner Dr. Ashwin Vasan said last week that the city has also seen \"cases begin to fall and transmission slow\" in recent days. Even if cases rise again, Donal Bisanzio, a senior epidemiologist with the nonprofit research group RTI International, predicts that there will be a \"rapid reduction\" at some point. Monkeypox \"is a disease that gives you full protection after you get it,\" he said. Reinfections aren't a factor. But no one knows for sure what's next. \"I think every public health response that I have ever worked, we want a crystal ball. It's just exceedingly hard to get there really early on, even for things that we have understood much better for years,\" said Janet Hamilton, executive director of the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists. \"Tell me when influenza season is going to end. I can't. \" Experts say that the ongoing outbreak is a rapidly evolving situation, making it difficult to know what to expect in the coming weeks and months. \"There is a very strong interest in using models and thinking about what the trajectories would be in different scenarios,\" Hamilton told CNN. All data-driven models require that at least some reasonable assumptions are incorporated. But with monkeypox, the United States is still collecting some of the foundational \"shoe leather epidemiology, boots on the ground pieces,\" Hamilton said. It's a \"highly infectious disease that's spreading very rapidly that we don't fully understand.\" Some of the stigma attached to the current outbreak may make people reluctant to seek medical attention, discuss recent contacts or come forward to get vaccinated, experts say. \"I'm always concerned about stigma and discrimination, as it can hinder trying to control an outbreak like this,\" said Dr. Wafaa El-Sadr, a professor of epidemiology at Columbia University who has researched HIV, emerging infections and other diseases. It could mean people aren't \"taking advantage of the important tools we have at hand to stop this outbreak.\" Generally, only about 15 to 25% of contacts are being identified, which can skew the understanding of the rate of disease spread, Hamilton said. \"That ends up being a very distinct challenge that then would directly impact what those models look like.\" While men who have sex with men have been disproportionately affected in the current outbreak, anyone can get monkeypox and a growing number of cases reported recently have been among women and children -- potentially changing the transmission map even more. And a recent shift in the federal vaccination strategy -- that potentially expands the existing vaccine supply by as much as five times, but poses other challenges -- marks a major change to another key forecasting factor. More than 1 million vials of the Jynneos vaccine have been allocated to states and other local jurisdictions, according to data from the US Department of Health and Human Services. However, only about 208,000 doses have been reported to the CDC as administered. In June, researchers from RTI International published that estimated the potential burden and duration of the monkeypox outbreak that did not yet have endemic disease. They projected that every three cases could cause 18 secondary cases if no prevention measures were put in place, with outbreaks lasting about six to nine months. Contact tracing and vaccination of close contacts could cut that risk by more than 70%, according to the model. But new knowledge and information has led them to adjust the model and rerun it, with updated estimates due out in a few weeks. \"We are talking about a model that was done just in the first month of transmission outside Africa. We were thinking that everything was going well,\" said Bisanzio, who is a co-author of RTI report. The model assumed that the public health response would be quick and effective, especially coming on the heels of the Covid-19 pandemic. \"We know that this story then evolved in a different way,\" he said, with a lag in response time, hesitancy around vaccination and transmission concentrated within one high-risk community that no one expected. \"I can tell you that the numbers (in the updated model) are much higher than the ones that we first estimated.\" That said, another one of the biggest adjustments to their model comes from a of men who have sex with men, in which about half of respondents said they changed their behaviors to protect themselves amid the ongoing outbreak. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington built an influential Covid-19 forecast model early on in the pandemic, but will not be doing the same for monkeypox. \"In our mind, this disease is not going to spread into the community as wide as we've seen with Covid,\" said Ali Mokdad, an epidemiologist and professor of health metrics sciences at IHME. There are some similarities to HIV that are concerning, but \"we don't see that being replicated here,\" he said, with monkeypox moving out of the body much faster and being much less deadly. While extensive data-driven models may be largely absent, experts say they are keeping a close watch on trends. \"You don't need a model to tell you that, at this point in time, the strategy has to be to identify those high risk individuals and vaccinate as many as possible,\" Hamilton said.

However, for more than 90% of patients on statins who experience muscle pain, the statin is not the cause of the pain, according to a published Monday in The Lancet and presented at the European Society of Cardiology Congress in Spain. \"Our results confirm that, in the majority of cases, statin therapy is not likely to be the cause of muscle pain in a person taking statin therapy,\" said the study, led by authors from Oxford Population Health and the Medical Research Council Population Health Research Unit at the University of Oxford. \"This finding is particularly true if the treatment has been well tolerated for a year or more before developing symptoms.\" The authors conducted a meta-analysis of 19 randomized double-blind trials of statin regimens versus placebos. All trials had over 1,000 participants and at least two years of follow up. They also looked at four double-blind trials of more and less intense statin regimens. Study author Colin Baigent, a professor of epidemiology at University of Oxford, said that there have been many non-randomized studies which don't involve any kind of placebo or random allocation to a statin that have produced \"really quite extreme\" estimates of how much muscle pain statins cause. \"This has put patients off starting statins, or made them stop treatment when they develop muscle pain because they simply look in the paper and they see that statins cause lots and lots of muscle pain and so they stop,\" Baigent said during a Science Media Center briefing. \"We were really trying to deal with that problem.\" The new study says that \"even during the first year of a moderate-intensity statin regimen, it is likely to be the cause in only approximately one in 15 patients who report muscle symptoms, rising to approximately one in 10 in those who are taking a more intensive regimen. \"In other words, the statin is not the cause of muscle symptoms in more than 90% of individuals who report such symptoms.\" The authors found that in the first year, statin therapy produced a 7% relative increase in muscle pain or weakness, but there was no significant increase after that. The increased risk was already present within the first three months after treatment was assigned. There were reports of at least one episode of muscle pain or weakness from 27.1% of patients assigned a statin versus 26.6% of those who had a placebo during a median 4.3 year follow up. In the trials looked at by the authors, they say that statin therapy, during the first year of use, caused approximately 11 additional muscle pain reports per 1,000 patients. \"What we conclude is that there are two things that we need to do as a profession, as a society,\" Baigent said in the briefing. \"The first thing is, we need to do a better job of managing patients who report muscle pain when they are taking a statin, because there's a tendency in patients to end up stopping the statin and that has a detrimental effect on their long term health. And the second thing we need to do is we need to look at the information that is available to patients in package inserts.\" He noted that if people were better informed about the real risks of muscle pains, then they might stay on statin therapy for longer. The study does have some limitations, including considerable heterogeneity in the methods used for muscle symptoms, some adverse event data not being available and most of the studies not excluding participants who may now be categorized as statin intolerant. In a commentary published alongside the study, Dr. Maciej Banach, a cardiologist at the Medical University of Lodz and Polish Mother's Memorial Hospital Research Institute in Poland, wrote that the possible side effects of statins shouldn't be a consideration when starting treatment. \"It should be strong emphasized that the small risk of muscle symptoms is insignificant in comparison with the highly proven cardiovascular benefits of statins,\" he wrote. The says heart disease is the leading cause of death for men, women and those of most racial and ethnic groups in the United States. There is one cardiovascular disease death every 34 seconds in the country. Last week, the US Preventive Services Task Force announced its latest guidance on the use of statins to prevent a first heart attack or stroke. The guidelines are more conservative than those put out by other groups, such as the American College of Cardiology. They recommend statins in adults 40 to 75 who have at lease one risk factor of cardiovascular disease and a 10% or high risk of a heart attack in the next 10 years.

According to provisional data published Wednesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, life expectancy at birth dropped by nearly a year between 2020 and 2021 -- and by more than two and a half years overall since the . Life expectancy at birth fell to 76.1 years, the lowest it has been in the US since 1996, and the biggest 2-year decline in a century. Covid-19 was the driving factor, with deaths from the virus contributing to half of the decline from 2020 to 2021, according to the report from the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics. The death rate from Covid-19 was higher in 2021 than it was in 2020, so it wasn't particularly surprising that life expectancy would fall again, Bob Anderson, chief mortality statistician for the CDC, told CNN. Also, drug overdose deaths reached a record high in 2021, killing about 109,000 people. And deaths from unintentional injuries -- about half of which are due to drug overdose -- was the second-leading cause of the decline in life expectancy. Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, also said it wasn't surprising, but it is frustrating. \"It is distressing to see a continuing negative impact of drug overdose on the life expectancy of Americans. These deaths often occur in young adults and therefore represent a tragically high number of years of life lost and devastating impact on individuals, families, and communities,\" she said. \"We have the science and the tools available to help us reverse this trend and reduce the number of overdose deaths in this country. But these tools are not being used effectively.\" Even if expected, the scale of the decline is still extraordinary. In 2021, mortality rates due to influenza and pneumonia decreased, and if not for these \"offsetting effects,\" the decline in US life expectancy would have been even greater, according to the report. \"Mortality generally, mainly since the 1950s, has changed rather slowly,\" Anderson said. Changes of more than a few tenths of a year have been considered substantial. The recent decline among American Indian and Alaska Native people is particularly \"astounding,\" Anderson said. The life expectancy for this group plunged by nearly 2 years between 2020 and 2021 and a startling 6.6 years since 2019 -- more than twice as much as it did for the total US population. At 65.2 years, the life expectancy for American Indians in 2021 was equal to the overall US life expectancy in 1944. \"When I saw that, in the report, I just -- my jaw dropped,\" Anderson said. \"It was hard enough to fathom a 2.7 year decline over 2 years overall. But then to see a 6.6 year decline for the American Indian population -- it just shows the substantial impact that the pandemic has had on that population.\" Deaths from Covid-19 directly were the leading contributor to the decline in life expectancy among American Indian people in 2021, but deaths due to drug overdose and other unintentional injuries, as well as chronic liver disease, which is often caused by alcohol abuse, were nearly equal contributors for this group. When it comes to the pandemic, Anderson said, \"I'm not just talking about Covid-19 necessarily, but also the other factors that seem to have increased during the pandemic.\" Experts say the pandemic exacerbated already existing disparities for American Indians and others. Dr. Matthew Clark, a chief medical officer with the Indian Health Service, said the findings of the new CDC report are concerning, but it has been known that American Indian and Alaska Native people \"suffer disproportionately with regard to health outcomes for a broad variety of conditions.\" There are \"unique aspects to addressing health outcomes\" in these communities, he said, and this data should be viewed as a \"call to action, an opportunity to redouble our efforts\" to address a broad range of factors that impact the health of these populations and engage with tribal communities to find solutions. \"Even in the midst of a very concerning report like this, I do think that there's hope,\" Clark said, and \"there is an opportunity to move the needle in the other direction.\" To do that, the goal should be to explore the root causes of those disparities for American Indians and others, said Ruben Cantu, an associate program director with Prevention Institute, a nonprofit focused on health equity. \"A lot of the talk is going to be around the pandemic,\" Cantu said. \"But we need to think about what has driven the conditions that have allowed certain communities to be more vulnerable\" in the first place, like crowded housing, poor access to health care and low-income jobs that don't allow for paid sick leave. A , published as a preprint in June, found that the decrease in life expectancy in the US over the course of the pandemic was \"highly racialized\" and substantially larger than it was for a set of comparable countries. In fact, that study found that life expectancy increased slightly between 2020 and 2021 for the set of 21 peer countries. The new data from the CDC highlights differences in life-expectancy trends by race and ethnicity, as well as by gender. In the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic, life expectancy declined least among White people. In the second year of the pandemic, however, this group saw the second-biggest decline in life expectancy -- and deaths due to Covid-19 contributed to the drop among White people more than any other racial or ethnic group. Once the most vaccinated group, the share of the White population that is fully vaccinated with their initial series now lags behind that of the Black, Hispanic and Asian populations, CDC data shows. Life expectancy in 2021 was highest among both Asian women (85.6 years) and men (81.2 years), the CDC data shows. Hispanic women were the only other group with a life expectancy greater than 80 years. In the total US population, life expectancy fell more among men than among women in 2021, widening a gap that has been growing over the past decade. The disparity in life expectancy between men (73.2 years) and women (79.1 years) is now nearly six years. The life expectancy for American Indian men in 2021 was 61.5 years, lower than any other group. Black men had the next lowest, at 66.7 years. A recent project by the Prevention Institute focused on the mental health and well-being of men and boys. It found that men and boys of color -- especially Black and Native American men -- \"start out with higher rates of trauma and mental health challenges,\" Cantu said, which can make them more vulnerable to other conditions. \"Over the last five or six years, we've heard a lot more about diseases of despair -- things like substance use, alcoholism and suicide -- and a lot of those things are connected,\" he said. \"It helps to point out how vulnerable certain communities can be to a lot of other conditions.\""},
{"url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2022/09/01/health/covid-omicron-booster-explainer-wellness/index.html", "title": "Everything you need to know about the updated Covid-19 boosters", "paragraphs": " There's a new kind of coming soon to a pharmacy or clinic near you. The US Food and Drug Administration has authorized updated vaccines that target the original strain of the coronavirus as well as the Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5. The hope is that these shots will improve protection against the currently circulating viruses that cause . Who should get these new shots? When will they be available? And why should you consider one? Here's everything you need to know about the bivalent boosters. These new bivalent vaccines carry instructions to help our cells make defenses against two strains of the virus that causes Covid-19. The shots direct cells to make antibodies that bind to certain parts of the spike proteins from both the original strain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron subvariants, which share an identical spike. BA.4 and BA.5 are the dominant variants in the United States, causing an average of 91,000 new infections each day. \"These are vaccines that are made, manufactured and delivered identically to the Covid mRNA vaccines that most of us have already gotten,\" said Dr. Gregory Poland, who leads the vaccine research group at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. \"In a sense, you've just changed the blueprints.\" Having twice the blueprints doesn't mean you're getting twice the dose of active ingredients, though. \"The total mRNA content -- the business part of the vaccine -- that leads to the immune response is the same amount,\" said Dr. William Gruber, senior vice president of vaccine research and development at Pfizer, which makes one of the updated vaccines. Pfizer's booster is a 30-microgram dose that contains 15 micrograms of mRNA against the ancestral strain and 15 micrograms against the BA.4 and BA.5 variants. It is authorized for people as young as 12. The company is also retooling its shots for children ages to 5 through 11 and will ask the FDA for authorization of those updated boosters in early October. It's working with the FDA to update vaccines for children ages 6 months through 4 years. Moderna's bivalent booster is a 50-microgram dose, with 25 micrograms of mRNA designed to fight the ancestral strain of the coronavirus and 25 micrograms of mRNA designed to fight the BA.4 and BA.5 variants. It's authorized for people 18 and older. The government has already been taking orders for these vaccines, and now that the FDA has authorized them, millions of doses will ship to tens of thousands of sites across the country. These include community health centers, health departments and pharmacies. As with past Covid-19 vaccines, these shots will be available free of charge. But they may be some of the last Covid-19 freebies from the government, which has said it's going to start commercializing treatments and vaccines this fall. Pfizer says it has the capacity to ship up to 15 million doses by September 9. The panel of experts that advises the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on its vaccine recommendations reviewed the science behind the shots Thursday and voted to recommend them. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky then signed off, meaning people can start getting the shots right away. \"What I'm expecting is, after CDC action, you'll start seeing some places start giving some shots in arms over the weekend, but very relatively few because [of the] Labor Day weekend. And my expectation is over next week, or certainly over the next 10 days, you're going to start seeing these bivalent vaccines become widely available across the country,\" Dr. Ashish Jha, who leads the White House Covid-19 Response Team, told CNN. The Biden administration expects appointment availability to ramp up over the first several days, with broad availability in a few weeks. People will be able to find locations at . The government is also preparing to launch a campaign that will urge Americans to get their annual flu shot along with an updated Covid-19 booster. Research on this approach suggests that it's safe. The updated Covid-19 inoculations will be the only game in town when it comes to boosters, at least for those 12 and up. The FDA says the older boosters are no longer authorized for this age group but will still be available as boosters for children ages 5 to 11. These are the first Covid-19 vaccines that will be authorized for use in people after being tested only in mice. This is much the same process that's followed each year when annual flu shots are updated. The FDA allowed companies to submit data from animal tests in order to speed these shots to the public. Studies in people are underway, according to Pfizer's Gruber. Dr. Peter Marks, who directs the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said he expects that it will be a month or two before data on humans is available. Officials say urgency with these boosters is warranted going into the fall, when Covid-19 is still circulating at high levels and influenza is expected to make a return. But the decision to rely on animal studies has generated some controversy. Some vaccine experts feel that animal studies don't provide sufficient evidence for these vaccines at this stage in the pandemic. \"You're asking people to get a new product for which there's no data,\" Dr. Paul Offit, who directs the vaccine education center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told CNN. \"Mice data are not adequate to launch 100-plus-billion-dose effort.\" Offit says it makes sense to use data from animal studies for updates to annual flu vaccines because we've used those shots for decades, and we understand what biomarkers to look for when gauging whether they work. These so-called correlates of protection are not as well understood for the Covid-19 vaccines. It's not just the shots that are different, Poland said. At this point in the pandemic, our immune systems are, too. Nearly all Americans have been infected with the coronavirus, vaccinated or both. Some people have had four or five doses of vaccine. \"So if you say to me, 'can you assure me that getting dose five or dose six of this new vaccine in the background of having received these previous doses is absolutely safe?' I'd say 'no, I can't.' We're extrapolating. And I think we ought to be clear about that,\" Poland said. FDA officials point out that animal studies weren't the only data they reviewed to make their decision. They considered two other lines of evidence. The first is the vaccines' track records. The same basic vaccines have now been given to hundreds of millions of people around the world. They have been shown to be extremely effective at preventing severe disease and death from Covid-19. Risks associated with mRNA vaccination are very, very low. The second line of evidence comes from bivalent vaccines that may soon be used in Europe. Earlier this year, Pfizer and Moderna presented an independent panel of experts who advise the FDA with data on a bivalent vaccine designed to target the original strain of Omicron, BA.1. That data showed that the vaccines boosted antibody responses and were well-tolerated. The UK has authorized these vaccines, but they will not be available in the US. The BA.1 strain isn't circulating any more, and the FDA asked the manufacturers to update their US shots to include BA.4 and BA.5 instead. Marks said in a briefing Wednesday that some evidence suggests that the BA.4 and BA.5 strains generate a stronger immune response than BA.1, which is another reason officials wanted to include them in the updated shots. FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said he understands that people may want to know more, but he's confident that these vaccines are safe and effective. \"It's fair for people to raise questions. But this really is the best consensus that we have among the experts that this is the best way to go. ... It's just painful to see people dying unnecessarily when there's a free treatment that would prevent their death,\" he said. \"I will be at the front of the line at the pharmacy getting my vaccination,\" said Califf, who will turn 71 next month. \"I'm very confident about this.\" In the past, tests of variant-specific vaccines have had lackluster results. It's hard to know what effect these bivalent vaccines could have. In a recent , published ahead of peer review, scientists tried to estimate this with a meta-analysis, or a study of studies. The gathered estimates of antibody levels after booster doses against the ancestral strains, as well as against specific variants, and tried to use those levels to predict how well the shots would work. They found that people got the biggest benefits from getting boosted, period. A booster against the ancestral strain of the virus that causes Covid-19 increased neutralizing antibodies 11-fold. The scientists estimated that would increase a person's protection against symptomatic infection over the next six months from 50% to 86.5%. Variant-specific boosters worked a little better, but the difference wasn't dramatic. After those shots, protection against symptomatic infection over the next six months rose to 90.2%, just a 4.6% increase. A of adverse events after mRNA booster vaccinations in adults the United States found that side effects were less common after booster doses than after second doses of the vaccine, and most were mild. About 1 in 8 adults reported a headache, fever or pain after a booster. In children and teens, after boosters were pain at the site of the injection, fatigue, headache and muscle aches. Very rarely, mRNA vaccines can cause myocarditis, or swelling in or around the heart. After more than 80 million booster doses given in the United States, the government safety surveillance systems received 37 verifiable reports of myocarditis. Most of these were in men. The highest rates of myocarditis in adults were in younger men -- ages 18 to 24. For every million booster doses given to men this age, the CDC expects about that about will have myocarditis. For adolescents, the rate is slightly higher but still extremely low: about for every million doses. Marks said that to minimize this risk, officials are directing that the vaccines be given at least two months after a previous dose. \"It seems to be associated when they're given closer to one another,\" he said. The Covid-19 vaccines were due for an update. As the coronavirus has been circulating, it has changed a lot. These changes have helped it slip past the antibodies that we made against older versions of the virus and older versions of the vaccine. As a result, it's gotten better at causing reinfections and breakthrough infections. Some of the monoclonal antibodies made to give people passive immunity against the virus have also stopped working against the new variants. The hope is that giving people updated vaccines will improve their ability to fight off the infection and shore up protection against severe disease that causes hospitalization or death. There is also some hope that updated boosters may slow the spread of the virus -- and thus the speed at which vaccine-busting variants appear. The coronavirus is changing at blistering speed. In a meeting with FDA vaccine advisers last June, Trevor Bedford, a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Reserach Center in Seattle, compared the speed of evolution of the viruses that cause Covid-19 to that of the viruses that cause influenza. Among the faster influenza viruses, he said, it takes about three years for a new strain to emerge and start showing up in testing in significant numbers. Among the variants of the virus that causes Covid-19, the Delta variant pulled off this feat in a year. Omicron did it in three to four months. So there is genuine concern that without something to slow transmission of the infection, we'll be forever stuck in catchup mode, waiting for faster and potentially more dangerous variants to emerge.

But have you ever noticed hurricane hunters' flight patterns shown by meteorologists on TV look like random, odd shapes? Those flight patterns may look like boxes or stars, but they serve specific purposes for each individual storm. Hurricane hunters don't fly away from these storms like commercial airlines do. They fly directly into them, but they don't just fly into and around the storms randomly. There is a method to the madness. There are two distinctive groups of hurricane hunters, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the US Air Force Reserve (USAF). Both organizations fly missions into tropical disturbances in order to record invaluable data used by forecasters at the National Hurricane Center (NHC). For the Hurricane Hunters, there are two main types of missions flown, fixed and invest. Fixed missions are designated for systems that meet tropical cyclone qualifications, such as tropical depressions, tropical storms, and hurricanes. The main objective is to mark the center of circulation, monitor winds speeds and pressure changes, and other variables that are tricky for satellites in space to measure in full detail. For fixed missions, 'Alpha' is most common flight pattern used to collect data in a tropical cyclone. \"The Alpha pattern is the standard profile we fly for fix missions so it's the one people are most familiar with seeing from us,\" , meteorologist and aerial reconnaissance weather officer with the Air Force Reserve's , said. \"The pattern consists of two legs flown at intercardinal directions, and when complete, looks a lot like the Greek Alpha symbol when including the crossleg.\" Cardinal directions are the standard points on a compass: north, south, east, and west. Intercardinal directions are the diagonal points in between: northeast, southeast, southwest, and northwest. Interestingly, the bigger, stronger storms tend to be the \"easier\" ones to fly in. \"From my perspective as the onboard meteorologist, the Alpha pattern is the \"easiest\" to fly. Because we normally fly those on stronger storms, there's not a lot of question where the storm center is,\" DeHart said. \"The flights can be rough of course, but at the end of the day we just go fly through the storm center, collect the data, and send it to NHC.\" The primary objective of an invest mission is to determine if a system meets the definition of a tropical cyclone; storms that do not yet have a name or any real tropical structure characteristics. For invest missions, the NHC will often send estimated coordinates of where they believe the center of circulation is, which is where the missions will target for their starting point. However, invest missions by nature have to be a bit more flexible for flight patterns, simply because there are so many unknowns with these types of storms. \"We never know what we're going to find, yet we always have to be thinking two or three steps ahead. So that really makes us need to think about the meteorology [in each particular storm],\" DeHart said. \"Is it a closed low or an open wave? Maybe it's closed but just elongated? Is it battling shear? Are there several smaller swirls competing to be the main circulation center? Weak storms and invests can be very tricky and require a lot of thinking on our toes.\" Air Force Hurricane Hunters have a to choose from for invest missions: X, Delta, and Box, just to name a few. DeHart explains the missions are ideal for the weaker, more uncertain storms. While the X pattern may resemble the Alpha pattern, it is flown at much lower altitudes, usually around 500 to 1,000 feet. \"Once a system becomes a tropical storm or hurricane, the hurricane hunters begin flying at higher altitudes, ranging from 5,000 to 10,000 feet depending on the severity of the storm,\" said Jessica Kendziorek, public affairs operations chief with the USAF 403rd Wing. Flight levels for the Delta and Box patterns are usually at or below 5,000 ft absolute altitude. \"The Delta and Box patterns are similar in that we'll fly around the periphery of the forecast center seeing if we can observe winds in all four quadrants of the storm that would indicate a closed circulation. If we find a closed circulation, we can confidently go [find] the center; if not, we'll continue the mission in 'invest mode',\" DeHart said. NOAA Hurricane Hunters also fly operational fixed and invest missions (though the names may be different), but they usually have more research-oriented objectives. They fly many unique , with different types of aircraft, depending on what type of mission is assigned. Hurricane Hunters also fly a third type of mission, which the Air Force rarely flies, according to DeHart, called synoptic missions. For fixed missions NOAA often flies a Figure 4, Rotated Figure 4 pattern, or a Butterfly pattern. \"The Butterfly and Figure 4 patterns flown by the WP-3D through the storm are typically the ones used to [find] the center of circulation,\" said Jonathan Shannon, public affairs specialist for the NOAA Aircraft Operations Center Office of Marine and Aviation Operations. The Rotated Figure 4 pattern is as it sounds; the Figure 4 pattern turned on side. \"The goal with every flight is to gather data all around the center of the storm, and those patterns allow us to efficiently fly through a storm's various quadrants,\" Nick Underwood, NOAA Hurricane Hunter, said. \"This data helps with predicting a storm's intensity, as well as determining exactly where the center is.\" For invest missions, the Lawnmower and Square Spiral patterns are flown, to determine if there are actual tropical characteristics associated with the area in which they are investigating. \"The Lawnmower Pattern allows us to map out a large area when we don't have a center to aim for,\" Paul Flaherty, science branch chief at NOAA's Aircraft Operations Center, said. \"Once we are able to map a full circulation (usually by finding a west wind), we'll shift back to Figure 4's based on that newly identified center position.\" The Square Spiral pattern is a survey mission meant to supply observations on the structure and characteristics including information about the vortex center, if it exists. There is a unique third type of mission flight pattern, often used to sample the surrounding atmosphere which helps forecasters know the direction the storm is likely to go. The Star 1 pattern focuses on a scan of the outer edges of the system. The closely-related Star 2 pattern also does an outer scan of the system, while also adding in a circumference loop near the center of circulation. Recently, NOAA's Gulfstream IV flew a Star-2 pattern around Hurricane Larry, to investigate outflow patterns from the storm and better determine where the storm was headed. \"The flight pattern you'll typically see from our Gulfstream IV is a circumnavigation of the storm itself, as well as sampling of the atmosphere around and ahead of the storm,\" Underwood said. \"This data helps with predicting the storm's track.\" Regardless of which entity is flying, the operational missions are the backbone for the National Hurricane Center, tasked with providing essential life-saving information about a storm. The NHC takes the data and uses it to issue guidance and advisories to the public, so people know whether Elsa or Ida or Nicholas are still tropical storms or have become hurricanes. We ended 2020 with a 30 named storms in the Atlantic basin and if this season is anything like last year, we have a long way to go."},

Cayette, who uses a wheelchair, called parish officials for help. They never came. Parish officials, however, told CNN that they did not receive calls that match Cayette's situation, adding that the government is \"by law, not allowed to enter or conduct work on private property unless it is an emergency life saving measure.\" It wasn't until two days later when a group of volunteers from New Orleans came to saw and remove the trees that he was able to go outside. \"I've seen it all,\" Cayette, a retired industry worker, told CNN. \"After Hurricane Betsy in 1965, the chemical plants started building and operating. A lot of them. It all changed.\" About 50 miles away in St. John the Baptist Parish, Robert Taylor Jr., executive director of Concerned Citizens of St. John, said many residents were trapped in their attics after the storm while others witnessed their roofs being ripped off by Ida. The lack of after the hurricane, Taylor said, is just another example of the neglect the community has long suffered. Residents say the government failed to prepare the community for the storm by not issuing an evacuation order earlier or assisting poor and vulnerable residents who could not manage to flee their homes, like Cayette. \"The government is obviously failing us and not protecting us,\" said Taylor, who evacuated from St. John before Hurricane Ida hit. \"And this just pushed it over the top.\" The predominantly Black community of St. John and the nearly majority Black population of St. James sit at the heart of Louisiana's \"Cancer Alley,\" the 85-mile stretch between New Orleans and Baton Rouge that's home to more than 150 chemical plants and oil refineries. According to the Environmental Protection Agency's 2019 , \u2014 census areas that typically contain 600 to 3,000 people \u2014 with the country's estimated highest cancer risks are in St. John. Until recently, Cayette, who has lived in the region for 70 years and previously worked at a nearby petrochemical plant, never connected the growth of the chemical industry to the region's suddenly high cancer rates. But then his wife died of breast cancer a few years ago -- and he has been diagnosed with prostate cancer on top of his diabetes. Now, he lives alone with the sight of industrial facilities looming outside his window. \"I was mad and disappointed at the government,\" Cayette said about the lack of response after Ida. \"What concerned me even more is that I'm disabled, but they couldn't come to help.\" For decades, scientists have claimed the planet has been rapidly warming because of greenhouse gas emissions, particularly from the burning of fossil fuels. Days after Ida ravaged the homes of and Mississippi, the EPA concluding that racial and ethnic minority communities disproportionately suffer the most severe consequences of climate change, indicating they are the least able to prepare for, and recover from, extreme climate events such as pollution, flooding and heat waves. If the planet reaches the critical warming threshold of 2 degrees Celsius -- which most unless they drastically cut emitting greenhouse gases from fossil fuels -- the report warns that Black people are projected to face the worst impacts of the climate crisis. \"It's absolutely an insult that the companies that are responsible for this are also the ones that are driving climate change,\" Naomi Yoder, staff scientist at the Healthy Gulf, a group working to restore natural resources in the region, told CNN. \"They're also one of the biggest drivers of land loss in Louisiana, which makes the effects of hurricanes worse.\" The coronavirus pandemic has also hit both parishes especially hard. In April 2020, St. John had the highest death rate per capita for Covid-19 in the United States, surpassing even the most densely populated urban hotspots. Around that time in St. James, the Covid-19 death rate was also than the overall national death rate. More than a year later, with the pandemic persisting, Category 4 Hurricane Ida threw the area's high cancer and Covid-19 rates and underlying environmental health hazards, which come from the area's rampant pollution from fossil fuel industries, into harsh relief. \"It's just risk on top of risk on top of risk,\" Kimberly Terrell, director of community engagement at the Tulane University Environmental Law Clinic, told CNN. \"There's always air pollution coming out of industrial facilities, and these communities have been burdened with that for decades.\" The Rev. Lionel Murphy, pastor of Tchoupitoulas Chapel in St. John, said the storm left devastating damage to his church along with homes and other buildings in the parish, exacerbating the emotional and physical toll that air pollution and health disparities have placed on communities. \"If only we can get some attention,\" Murphy said, referring to public officials and emergency responders. \"The people are going to leave and come back, but this storm aggravates so much else because Covid is pretty strong in St. John.\" In the early months of the pandemic, Harvard's school of public health released a showing a link between fine particulate matter, also known as PM 2.5 pollution, and increased mortality rates from Covid-19. Terrell wanted to know what that meant for Louisiana, particularly in Cancer Alley. After scraping the raw data from the Harvard study and performing her own analysis, she found that the highest death rates from Covid-19 and a majority of PM 2.5 concentrations were in Cancer Alley. Ida added another layer of affliction by destroying houses and forcing residents to emergency shelters or relatives' homes, where they may be clustered together with potential for increased Covid-19 transmission. \"It seems like these communities are just continually burdened with risks that they didn't ask for, and don't deserve to be burdened with,\" Terrell said. The current 7-day average is more than 42 new Covid-19 cases per 100,000 in St. John and more than 177 new cases per 100,000 in St. James, according to . The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention categorizes St. John and St. James as a community with high levels of Covid-19 transmission. Taylor said he worries that residents who have been sickened by cancer as well as Covid-19 won't get the medical care they need after having to evacuate because of Ida's impacts. Some are being transported to shelters where they could potentially spread Covid-19 or even contract it, he said, echoing Terrell's concern. Prior to Ida, of residents in St. James Parish and St. John Parish were living below the poverty line, according to Census data. \"This is a mess,\" Taylor told CNN. \"I don't see how poor people are expected to survive this.\" The proliferation of petrochemical facilities and oil refineries throughout Cancer Alley has become a familiar sight to residents along the industrial corridor. Cayette said he remembers industrial facilities emerging after Category 4 Hurricane Betsy pummeled the region in 1965. But it was only recently that residents began to realize the invisible danger the industry caused on public health and the ironic effects it has on the climate. When a hurricane is barreling toward an industry-heavy region, petrochemical facilities and oil refineries typically begin to shutter their plants, which involves burning anywhere from hundreds to of hazardous materials. As part of emergency shutdown procedures, these facilities emit or burn various unprocessed chemicals and gases through a process known as flaring. Oftentimes, Yoder said, the emissions continue to escape even after the hurricane has knocked out power lines. \"This is not something new to these communities, and it's not necessarily even unique to a disaster situation,\" Terrell said of refineries emitting toxic compounds. \"It seems like consistently the people who are breathing these toxins are the last to find out about it.\" In St. Charles Parish, for instance, a Shell Norco manufacturing complex has been spewing residual gases as residents pick through the rubble of Hurricane Ida's aftermath. After the storm, the EPA contacted Shell about the excessive smoke and reports of noxious gas coming out of its refinery. In a report, that Shell is conducting \"community air monitoring\" and \"looking at all options to try to reduce emissions to flare.\" \"While the site is safe and secure, we are experiencing elevated flaring due to a lack of steam generation,\" Curtis Smith, a Shell spokesperson, told CNN. \"Crews are working around the clock to complete repairs and we are making good progress on minimizing flaring until power is restored.\" In St. James Parish, residents like Sharon Lavigne have been fighting new petrochemical plants attempting to set up shop in their community. Five years ago, Lavigne was diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis. Blood tests revealed that she had aluminum inside her body, which she later blamed on the slew of industrial facilities after attending a few environmental justice workshops. Angered by what she learned about the industry growing in her backyard, Lavigne founded RISE St. James, a faith-based environmental justice group trying to stop any new industrial development in Cancer Alley, which Cayette is also a member of. One of their was against the Taiwanese plastics manufacturer Formosa, which was set to build a in St. James Parish. Not only do Formosa's own that their mammoth facility could emit more of the cancer-causing compound than just about any other facility in the country, but their chosen location also happens to sit on two former 19th-century sugarcane plantations and a , according to a filed against the facility. \"My grandparents lived on this land. They bought this land and lived on it,\" Lavigne told CNN. \"And then when I got married, I built a house on this land.\" And while Formosa tried to push ahead with its construction during the pandemic, RISE St. James fought hard to block the company, delaying the construction further. The US Army Corps of Engineers early this year ordered Formosa to conduct a new environmental review of the petrochemical facility, thanks to legal complaints, protests and lawsuits like RISE St. James. While the battle to block the multibillion-dollar facility isn't over, Hurricane Ida added to the community's problems. The storm tore Lavigne's roof and caused her ceiling to collapse, just like it did to many other houses in the parish. \"So many of us suffered damages from Ida,\" Lavigne said, \"so after RISE members rebuild, we're going to help the rest of the community.\" Cancer Alley has faced many disasters, but none as challenging as a hurricane, air pollution and pandemic happening at once. To Cayette and Lavigne, living next to industrial facilities is a death sentence. It may take years for the community to recover, but Lavigne said they've been victorious before. As long as the fossil fuel industry continues to warm the planet and pollute their backyards, she said grassroots organizations will keep fighting. \"People tell me they're glad we're fighting the industry,\" she said. \"Many tell me they can't be out there to help me, but they're praying for me. That was nice.\""},

They have occurred in all 50 states and have been spotted throughout the year. While they are most common in the United States, tornadoes can occur all over the globe. While great strides have been made in the study of tornadoes, there's still so much we don't know about them. They have been studied immensely during the last few decades to learn what causes them and how they form. CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller, who is also a storm chaser, has been following and studying these storms since 2005. \"Something you learn from studying tornadoes, especially in the field, is that there is no perfect formula for forming a tornado -- every storm is unique,\" says Miller. \"Sometimes, it may appear that a storm is in a perfect environment for a tornado to form, yet it never does. Conversely, tornadoes frequently form in marginal environments where it seems like one or more 'ingredients' to storm formation is missing or lacking,\" says Miller. While there's no perfect formula as to which storms will produce tornadoes, there's commonality in the anatomy of the systems that result in tornadoes. There are even signs you can see that will help you understand the life cycle of a developing storm that could produce a tornado. As warm air rises, clouds begin to grow taller and taller. This is the developing phase of the thunderstorm. You can see fluffy white cumulus clouds grow taller with your own eyes. This is before you see rain or hear thunder. As the clouds grow, you will notice the bottom of the cloud darkening. You will many times see the very top of the cloud flattening out, creating an anvil shape that protrudes from the top of the cloud. This indicates very cold air at the top of the cloud and could be a precursor to the possibility of hail. As the storm matures, it could become what's known as a supercell. A supercell is a rotating thunderstorm. \"Nearly all supercells produce some sort of severe weather (large hail or damaging winds) but only 30 percent or less produce tornadoes,\" says the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. During this mature phase of the thunderstorm or supercell; heavy rain, lightning, hail and very strong winds are expected. Sometimes, you will feel a strong gust of wind a few moments before the rain arrives. This is called a gust front. This is caused by cool air being forced down from the storm cloud. When the cold air hits the ground, it spreads out quickly, ahead of the storm. This is a sure sign that a storm is near. Tornadoes are usually formed from supercells. These supercells develop when there are several ingredients in place to help them thrive: instability, lift and wind shear. Within the supercell, wind shear becomes a crucial component to the storms development. Shear is when winds change directions with height. This creates spin within the thunderstorm cloud. Another force that's acting inside the supercel is a downdraft. This is an area of drier air that is pushed down from the storm. As it's forced down, it wraps around the backside of the storm. The updrafts and downdrafts work in tandem to pull the horizontal column of air down to form the tornado. This vertical column of air is called a funnel cloud until it touches the ground -- at that point it becomes a tornado. \"The most telltale sign that a tornado could be forming, when you are looking at a close-range severe thunderstorm, is the 'wall cloud,'\" says Miller. The wall cloud is a lowering of the cloud base that will lead to the vortex, or spinning of air. When this rotating column of air touches the ground, a tornado has formed. The presence of a wall cloud doesn't always mean a tornado will form, but it certainly ups the odds. \"You will know you are looking at a wall cloud because it will hang noticeably lower than the rest of the thunderstorm and you may notice it is rotating if you look closely,\" says Miller. Most tornadoes are relatively small and short-lived, and can still be dangerous and cause damage. However, more violent tornadoes can be more than a mile wide and stay on the ground for more than an hour. This is because they have much more momentum than the smaller tornadoes, making them harder to stop. Miller has witnessed roughly 15-20 tornadoes during his years storm chasing. \"There is no denying that there is a certain amount of excitement that comes from seeing a tornado when you are set out with the intent of seeing one,\" says Miller. \"At the same time, you are balancing that excitement with a sizable amount of anxiety and concern over what the tornado could do, especially if there are residents in the immediate path of the storm. As someone who spent years studying, and many more years reporting on, tornadoes, it still gets all my nerves firing when you see a tornado in person.\" The smaller tornadoes have winds of 60-110 mph, while the more violent tornadoes can have winds from 160 to more than 200 miles per hour. The strongest winds ever recorded on Earth were from a tornado, on at more than  CNN's Jackson Dill and CNN meteorologist Haley Brink contributed to this report"},

I've visited the Wall of Wind on the Florida International University (FIU) campus many times. It is a wall of enormous fans inside a big warehouse-type building that can blow air up to 160 mph, which would be a Category 5 hurricane, to test infrastructure and research the power of wind. However, in our changing climate, sadly, 160 mph isn't strong enough. So, the National Science Foundation (NSF) just awarded a $12.8 million Extreme Events Institute for the design of a full-scale testing facility capable of producing winds of 200 mph, along with a water basin to simulate storm surge and wave action in extreme winds. FIU will be able to build a house under the current building codes, start up the fans and see if it can withstand 200 mph winds. Will the roof detach? Will the house still be standing at all? The water basin will look like an enormous pool. It will also be able to simulate different coastlines. Storm surge tends to be worse when the coastlines are more shallow like along the Florida Panhandle. The facility will be able to simulate all of it. \"If you think about trying to future-proof, a changing hazard environment, a hazard scape, the US hazard scape with climate change, the past is not much of a guide. In fact, it can be deceiving,\" said Dr. Richard Olson, director of the Extreme Events Institute at FIU. \"So, if we're going to future-proof, we need to be able to research and test what future hazard events will look like. You can't future-proof in a changing environment if you're looking backwards.\" It's true. Climate change is showing us r, moving slower and are holding more water than ever before. They are also rapidly intensifying, meaning the winds are increasing at least 35 mph in a 24-hour period. In 2021, five hurricanes in the Atlantic rapidly intensified. And in 2020, TEN Atlantic hurricanes rapidly intensified. of those storms. \"Dorian in 2019 is the one that totally got my attention,\" said Olson. \"It hit 185 mph over the Bahamas, and until the last day and a half, it was heading straight up Eighth Street in Miami.\" Dorian ended up causing across Abaco and Grand Bahama. \"The scientific consensus is that we're going to see more intense storms, so we have to research and test for more intense storms,\" said Olson. \"Otherwise, nature's going to keep hitting us with harder stuff than we're ready for.\" The facility will be the first of its kind in the world to combine wind speeds of greater magnitude along with a water component. Eventually the facility will be able to test how different types of infrastructure, roads, bridges will all respond with a Category 6 storm. \"We can start putting all of these components together to get a much better picture of what nature is going to be hitting us with,\" says Olson. Yes, I realized I just referred to it as a Category 6 storm. And it might make some of you a little uncomfortable. To be honest, it bothers me a little bit too. But to be fair, if you look at the for the hurricanes, they are all -- more or less -- in about 20 mph increments. When a Category 5 hurricane's wind speeds start at 157 mph, and we see storms with maximum sustained winds of 180 mph, it's a number that makes me go pale. Since 2010, there have been 18 storms globally with recorded wind speeds of at least 178 mph at some point during their life span. and were two storms in the Atlantic to meet the threshold. It begs the question, especially for messaging purposes, do these types of storms need a special name? Category 6? Super-hurricane? Just something to put an exclamation point on how intense these specific storms are. But the truth of the matter is, most people who die in hurricanes don't die from wind, but from water. I reached out to my friend, Dennis Feltgen, the public affairs officer at the National Hurricane Center (NHC) about whether he thought there would ever be a day in our future we would see a Category 6, and here is what he had to say: I do agree with Dennis, but I also think as storms become stronger, wetter and slower, there might be a day the category system evolves from what it is now, just as the EF scale or Fujita scale was in 2007. And by the way, the same facility will also test tornado and thunderstorm winds. There are a few research facilities studying extreme winds. Watch below to see what 100 mph winds can do to a house. \"I think the interaction between the various components of hurricanes, the waves, the flooding, the currents, and the wind, the debris, all of that, it's very important to simulate that as practically as possible,\" said Dr. Arindam Gan Chowdhury, professor of environmental engineering at FIU. \"Everything is not possible to replicate Mother Nature.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Prediction Center on Tuesday forecast 14 to 21 named storms, six to 10 hurricanes and three to six major hurricanes -- of Category 3 strength or greater. The 2020 and 2021 seasons both exhausted the hurricane name list and broke records. No one can say for sure if this year will be similar, but in early April, , which were right in line with what NOAA is forecasting. The CSU forecast called for 19 named storms, nine hurricanes and four major storms. After back-to-back years of using all the hurricane names and resorting to the Greek alphabet, the World Meteorological Organization decided to do away with using the Greek alphabet and to be used if all the hurricane names are exhausted once again. Of course it's impossible to know how many of those storms will make landfall along the US coast, or where the largest storms will develop. However, during the announcement, NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad recognized that the current hurricane cycle for the Atlantic is a busy one. \"If you go back two years, the 2020 hurricane season broke records across the board and it's the most active season on record with 30 named storms,\" said Spinrad. \"The 2021 hurricane season, which is the third most active year on record in terms of names of storms brought us 21 named storms with impacts, ranging from the Appalachian Mountains all the way to New England, resulting in over $78.5 billion in US damage.\" There are several contributing factors that play into a \"busy\" hurricane season. \"We are in an active period,\" said Spinrad. \"There are certain ingredients that drive the intensity and the frequency of hurricanes.\" One is the existing in the equatorial Pacific. This phenomenon creates cooler-than-average ocean temperatures around the equator in the Pacific and results in weather impacts around the globe. La Ni\u00f1a presents favorable conditions for hurricanes -- in contrast to that of El Ni\u00f1o. Hurricane seasons under El Ni\u00f1o conditions are known for upper-level wind patterns across the Caribbean that tear hurricanes apart as they try to form, making the seasons less active. Another reason for the above-normal forecast is the location of what's called the \"Gulf Loop Current.\" This current is \"a 600-foot-deep river of hot Caribbean water that travels between Cancun, Mexico and western Cuba into the Gulf,\" said CNN meteorologist Chad Myers. This loop current is flowing farther north now, forcing warm water at deeper levels of the ocean to travel closer to the coastal areas along the Gulf of Mexico. \"The warm water is simply too deep and the hurricane has an unlimited supply of hot water for intensification,\" said Myers. Forecasters are comparing the position of the loop current with where it was placed in the record-breaking 2005 season -- when Hurricanes Katrina and Rita both made landfall. \"Yes, the loop current does look like 2005,\" said Matthew Rosencrans, lead hurricane season outlook forecaster with NOAA's Climate Prediction Center. \"But it depends if a storm actually moves over that loop current and forecasting the specific track of storms is not something we can do beyond a week time frame,\" Rosencrans added. During the 2021 hurricane season, eight storms made landfall along the US Gulf Coast and in 2020 six made landfall along the Gulf. In 2020, and both slammed into southwest Louisiana, making landfall roughly 15 miles apart. \"In 2021, ripped through Southeast Louisiana, then caused more . \"Hurricane Ida spanned nine states, demonstrating that anyone can be in the direct path of a hurricane and in danger from the remnants of a storm system,\" said FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell. \"It's important for everyone to understand their risk.\""},

All the homes are just destroyed,\" Tezeno recounted. She took a long pause; the wound was as fresh as it was that August day in 2020. Tezeno arrived at her Cameron Parish neighborhood fearing the worst, and amid the rubble, there stood her home. It looked unscathed. But Tezeno's feelings of hope were quickly dashed when she opened the door. Inside, it was a very different story. \"The back was all blown out. The AC unit flew off the back of our house. All the siding came off the house, my back porch on my house with two bedrooms and the bathrooms were all caved in,\" Tezeno told CNN. For two years, Tezeno -- a single mother -- and her four children have not been able to move back in as the home gets repaired. She's been living with relatives as she balances what seems like three full-time jobs: her actual full-time job, raising her family, and endlessly dealing with insurance companies. \"This whole thing has taken an emotional toll on me,\" she admitted. Tezeno and her family are preparing to move back in a matter of weeks, which also happens to be right in time for the start of the hurricane season. NOAA is predicting , with 6-10 hurricanes and 3-6 major storms (Category 3 or higher). According to Colorado State University, the chances of Louisiana getting hit with a named storm within 50 miles this season are 84%. \"Oh Jesus, keep us spared,\" Tezeno sighed. As Tezeno and her fellow Louisianans try to mentally prepare for hurricanes yet to come, two years after Laura, Lake Charles -- 45 miles north of Cameron Parish -- still looks like a blue patchwork quilt. \"I still see blue tarps out there, there are plenty of homes and businesses that are still not completely put back together,\" Lake Charles National Weather Service meteorologist Stephen Corbani observed. \"There is a literal PTSD out there in the community,\" explained Lake Charles Mayor Nic Hunter. \"It's a visceral thing.\" The storm cost more than a billion dollars in the state of Louisiana alone, with more than 44,000 households approved by to receive housing assistance. According to , there are still more than 2,000 cases still open in the Lake Charles area -- that's 2,000 families still working to rebuild. \"We have some homes that literally have not been touched since Hurricane Laura,\" Hunter noted. But he told CNN they just got word . \"Though it has taken far too long, there is over a billion dollars in federal aid that has been allocated for hurricanes Laura and Delta. We are immensely thankful for that,\" he added. The previous two hurricane seasons have been particularly cruel for Louisiana. In 2020, , and in 2021, , a Category 4 behemoth, battered the southeastern part of the state on the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. The poundings have left residents wary of what lies ahead. \"Certainly, as we approach hurricane season, locals are just a bit more on edge than they were prior to 2020,\" Hunter acknowledged. While it is impossible to know exactly where these storms will make landfall, the forecasts are grim. \"Looking at some of the climate signals that are out there, like , it seems like we're in store for another above normal season, just in terms of numbers and activity across the Atlantic basin,\" Carboni projected. Lake Charles is home for Carboni too, and like Tezeno, he hopes this year's busy season doesn't end up affecting his area, still so vulnerable from two seasons ago. \"The last thing we need would be for another hurricane to affect this area,\" Carboni remarked. If you are in a hurricane zone and are preparing for the upcoming season, hopefully you have a plan for you and your family, as well as a . After talking to Tezeno, though, she expressed some advice I think many times gets overlooked. \"Write down everything that you have. I don't care if it's minor and take pictures of everything that you can and check your policy,\" she urged. She also recommended securing your home if you evacuate. She recalled many of her neighbors fled their homes, only to come back and find it structurally damaged AND everything inside looted. Lastly, she advised having some sort of hurricane savings account. \"Have as much as you can to take care of yourself without relying on insurance, because sometimes they are not as quick to come to your aid as you think.\""},

It's called cloud seeding, and it's nothing new. It's been around since the 1940s and countries all over the world have been doing it for various reasons , but it's a growing practice in the US, especially in the drought-stricken West. It's also surrounded with controversy. We spoke with Julie Gondzar who is the program manager for , who admits she gets lots of calls about what they are doing. Gondzar said some people say \"you're playing God,\" others say \"you are stealing moisture from the storm,\" making other areas drier than they normally would be, kind of like robbing Peter to pay Paul. There are also environmental factors to consider, as well as the cost-effectiveness versus the reward, which in the West these days water is liquid gold. \"Think about it like water storage, but in the winter on mountaintops,\" is how Gondzar described what cloud seeding is trying to achieve in her state, \"in a nutshell.\" Wyoming started cloud seeding in 2003 . Then eight seasons ago, they started doing it in an official capacity after their 10-year study proved it works. This season, they have gone on 28 flight missions for cloud seeding in Wyoming. She pointed out there are four weeks left in the season, so she is hoping for more opportunities before it winds down. When you compare Wyoming to other states such as Utah and North Dakota, who have been cloud seeding since the '70s and '80s, the state is fairly new to the game. Cloud seeding uses an already existing cloud, and injects silver iodide into the cloud, which adds tiny particles called ice nuclei (which water needs to freeze). Clouds, in basic terms, are a collection of water droplets and/or ice crystals floating in the sky. The nuclei help the cloud produce precipitation, and artificial ice nuclei help create more precipitation than the cloud would produce otherwise. It's done in two ways: One way is from the ground and the other is from the air, using silver iodide as the seeding agent. \"The ground-based generators kind of look like small weather stations, are like 20 feet tall, and they aerosolize into the atmosphere,\" Gondzar explained. \"But you have to wait for the right atmospheric conditions so that the plume goes over the mountain range.\" It makes seeding a little more tricky, because if the wind is blowing in the wrong direction, you'll completely miss your target. The most popular way is by plane, using flares. \"There are flares on the wing of the planes with silver iodide inside of cardboard casings and there are flares on the belly of the plane,\" Gondzar pointed out. Once the pilot flies into the storm, they ignite the cardboard casings full of silver iodide and \"seed\" the clouds. The result is more moisture in the cloud, resulting in more precipitation. The silver iodide \"is a natural salt compound,\" Gondzar emphasized. \"The reason it's used is because the geometric shape down to a molecular level is very similar to that of an ice crystal. And if you don't have that, you're not going to create additional ice crystals, which will then accumulate into snowflakes.\" But if you think you can bust the drought by using planes to modify the weather, Gondzar said think again. \"Cloud seeding does not fix the drought,\" Gondzar said. \"You can't break a drought with cloud seeding. It's a tool in the toolbox.\" Gondzar admitted while they know the method makes more snow than they would otherwise receive, it's difficult to know exactly how much more they are getting. \"There's evidence of it in radar and all kinds of papers written,\" Gondzar noted. \"The question that they're trying to answer now is how well does it work? And that's a difficult question to answer. Because there's an abstract piece of this. There's really no way to know how much snow a particular system would have produced.\" She knows cloud seeding doesn't generate a lot of additional snowfall, but every little bit helps these days. According to , some areas in the state are only at 60% of average for snowpack this season, and the window for additional snow is slowly closing as the season winds down. Since most of the West gets the majority of its water from snowmelt, she hopes what they are doing helps a tiny bit in the long term. \"It's a small incremental change over a long period of time. That's why consistency is important,\" Gondzar urged. She added at $28-$34 per acre foot, cloud seeding is relatively cheap. \"Those numbers tell us that this is an inexpensive way to help add water to the system. Essentially, we are creating a little bit of additional snowpack, that becomes additional streamflow in the spring and summer.\" But you need a cloud, to cloud seed. You can't just go out to the Mojave Desert and make it rain. \"This is not something that we can do out of thin air,\" Gondzar cautioned. \"The criteria is very specific for this to actually work.\" It can only be done within already existing clouds that were going to produce snow anyway and there has to be a certain temperature range. \"The silver iodide in the cloud is initiating that snow,\" Gondzar said. \"But you can't just make snow out of nothing. You have to have the supercooled liquid water in the cloud.\" She explained part of what made this year difficult was the much drier weather during the last month. There were fewer opportunities to cloud seed. \"A lot of people think it's manipulating the weather pattern,\" Gondzar remarked. \"We are essentially just playing with cloud dynamics and cloud physics, on a super, super-small scale.\" She is a meteorologist as well and points out the moisture from the weather systems come from much bigger areas like the Gulf of Mexico or the Pacific. \"There's always a huge stream of moisture that our systems are tapping into, and cloud seeding probably brings an additional one to 2% down to the surface.\" While Gondzar is confident cloud seeding doesn't steal snow from another area, some scientists disagree. Daniel Swain is a climate scientist at UCLA and spoke with my colleague and climate writer . He told her \"It is possible that you're actually stealing water from someone else when you do this, because it may be, at least on a regional basis, a zero-sum game where if water falls out of the cloud in one spot, it's even drier by the time it makes it downwind to the next watershed.\" He went on to ask, \"To what extent are you just shifting around the spatial distribution of precipitation during a scarcity period rather than actually causing it to rain or snow more overall?\" He believes water equity issues need to be researched more. Another note of controversy has been the safety of the chemicals used in cloud seeding. Gondzar stressed it is not made of harmful chemicals like some people claim. She pointed out they did lots of testing for before they started officially cloud seeding and could not find any traces of harmful amounts of silver. \"There's silver in natural background levels in the water in the soil everywhere, on the surface of the earth,\" Gondzar noted. \"So you already have a natural background level of silver, it's been really difficult to find anything beyond background levels.\" She said the amount of silver iodide used is only a few grams at a time. What she's hoping is a small price to pay for bigger rewards down the road. There have been climate concerns surrounding cloud seeding. Here's more from Ramirez, who reached out to a few scientists, to get their take on cloud seeding's climate angle. Although cloud seeding has been around for decades and is currently being operated in roughly 50 countries, many climate scientists remain skeptical of the technology's efficacy as well as the time and effort put into trying to manipulate weather. Swain pointed out it has been historically difficult to design scientific experiments to test the effectiveness of cloud seeding, leaving behind a trail of unclear, intangible evidence on what the benefits are. \"How do you know how much precipitation that might actually end up falling from that cloud occurred due to the seeding? Or how much would have fallen without the seeding?\" Swain told CNN. \"This isn't a setting where you can do a truly controlled experiment.\" Cloud seeding experiments typically deal with a narrow set of parameters, according to Swain, taking into account weather conditions including cloud cover, time of the day, and location. Additionally, the rapidly changing climate adds another layer to the list of variables. As the planet warms, weather patterns and clouds will constantly evolve, often in unexpected ways. That's what Sarah Tessendorf, a scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, and other researchers from universities and an Idaho power company, set out to examine in 2017. , published in 2020 in the Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences, managed to quantify how effective cloud seeding is. Yet uncertainties still linger. During the cold winter months in 2017, the researchers flew aircraft to inject silver iodine, the seeding chemical used, into clouds over the Payette Basin in Idaho, while simultaneously using radars and models to measure its impact on snowfall. In three cloud-seeding events, the scientists identified \"unambiguous seeding patterns,\" in cold cloud decks not producing ice at all; but once seeded, ice crystals formed inside mirroring the same pattern the aircraft had flown. They were then able to track the formed ice and snow to the ground and measure how much additional snow fell from the seeded clouds. Despite the results, Tessendorf said more experiments need to be done to improve the technology for it to become a sweeping solution to the climate crisis. The amount of precipitation produced by cloud seeding \u2014 up to 10% \u2014 isn't enough at all to quench the drought-stricken West. \"It could help over the years augment the storage levels in reservoirs, so that when you get into that extract, you might just go into that drought with a little bit more than you would have otherwise,\" she said. \"That to me is the way that cloud seeding should be viewed. It's not going to be the silver bullet, but it could be a helpful tool in a water manager's toolbox.\" When it comes to tackling climate change as a whole, many also question the methods such as the deployment of fossil fuel-powered aircraft to inject silver iodide into clouds, arguing it is counterintuitive to the overall climate goals of slashing fossil fuel emissions. But Tessendorf argued it is a small price to pay in order to improve the technology. \"I will say that the number of aircraft and the duration of these flights to do cloud seeding and the programs that are currently having it done pales in comparison to the number of commercial flights and aircraft we have in the skies all over the world right now,\" she contended. \"So it's to me a drop in the bucket of extra fossil fuels being burned.\" \"But that does not mean that there isn't room for improvement there in order to have more of a clean process,\" Tessendorf added. With the climate crisis accelerating, climate scientists like Swain say resources are much better invested in climate solutions already guaranteed to make significant and equitable impacts. \"There needs to be controlled studies that actually shows it was the seeding that increased the precipitation in a meaningful way,\" Swain asserted. \"The best case scenario is it's a small incremental adjunct to other water-saving or conservation measures during scarce periods, but even that's not clear if it would really work in that capacity in any systematic way.\" CNN meteorologist Judson Jones contributed to this article"},

We had several this year that brought , staggering to the mountains in the west, and even . An atmospheric river is a long, narrow region in the atmosphere that can transport moisture thousands of miles, like a fire hose in the sky. We talk a lot about them in the West because large-scale storm systems bring the region up to 40% of their yearly rainfall. But we started wondering: Is there anywhere else where these happen? Apparently, atmospheric rivers also occur in the eastern US, unleashing a river of moisture like what we will see this week. The reason East Coast atmospheric rivers aren't talked about much isn't because they are rare. In fact, they are quite common. \"Atmospheric rivers are more frequent on the East Coast than they are on the West Coast,\" said Jason Cordeira, Associate Professor of Meteorology at Plymouth State University. \"They're just not as impactful and don't usually produce as much rainfall.\" While Cordeira noted it is tough to give an exact number of how many atmospheric rivers impact the East every year, he says a rough estimate would be anywhere from 80-100 per year! WOW. The West gets about half that number of atmospheric rivers each year, yet they account for double the annual rainfall percentage. \"The West Coast is a much more arid climate. And they usually get precipitation during just half of the year,\" Cordeira pointed out. The East Coast accumulates its annual rainfall from several sources: afternoon storms, cold fronts and hurricanes, which can bring MUCH higher rain amounts than an atmospheric river. \"Some of the strongest atmospheric river events that are perfectly oriented, can produce 6-8 inches of rain,\" Cordeira reported. \"Those totals are dwarfed by the amount of rainfall that we can get from a hurricane.\" Some recent hurricanes such as , have resulted in rainfall totals measured in FEET, not inches. This week's atmospheric river won't leave the footprint Harvey did by any stretch, but it could affect the same areas as Harvey. The Deep South will once again be hit by a series of storms this week, along with the Plains, the Rockies and the Pacific Northwest. So, needless to say, this week's weather will be much more far-reaching. It has no doubt been a super active stretch of severe weather in the South and Southeast, as this is the fourth week in a row where active weather is affecting the same areas. However, as we get deeper into April and May, we should start to see the storm tracks shift a little farther north into what is traditionally, \"Tornado Alley,\" which is what we will begin to see this week. A series of storm systems will impact the US this week from coast to coast. It will bring everything from blizzard conditions to tornadoes to flash flooding, an exhausting week to say the least. The Storm Prediction Center (SPC) has placed a Level 3 out of 5 \"enhanced risk\" of severe weather today for central Arkansas, however, anywhere from San Antonio to the Ohio Valley could see storms today. The extreme northeast of Texas, southeast Oklahoma and western and central Arkansas, including Little Rock, are under a tornado watch until 11 p.m. CT Monday. Large hail -- possibly greater than baseball size -- and wind gusts to 70 mph are also a concern for the area. While this is happening in the central part of the country, a robust system will be entering the Pacific Northwest, and will crisscross the country in dramatic fashion today, bringing heavy rain to the coastal areas of Washington, Oregon and California, and several feet of snow for the Cascades. \"This system will deepen as it moves farther inland, setting the stage for an intense late season winter storm to impact the Rockies and Northern Plains,\" noted the Weather Prediction Center (WPC). \"Over a foot of snow is likely to accumulate between eastern Montana and central North Dakota on Tuesday.\" Blizzard warnings are in effect for portions of the Dakotas and Montana from Tuesday through Thursday. \"Total snow accumulations between 12 and 24 inches [are forecast],\" said the National Weather Service (NWS) office in Bismarck. \"Winds gusting as high as 50 mph [are also possible].\" The heavy snow and high winds will make travel nearly impossible for those areas due to whiteout conditions and will also create avalanche dangers. Many of the western mountain ranges have some sort of avalanche danger today, so be sure to check before heading out, especially in the backcountry. We wrote a story earlier in the season about what causes extreme avalanche dangers and why you only have about 15-30 minutes to be found alive after burial. Click to read more. After the system blankets the West with its late-season dump of snow, the storm will amplify as it heads east. It will combine with the available moisture provided by the atmospheric river we talked about and will result in the perfect setup for severe weather. The tornado threat will be even stronger for Tuesday and Wednesday in the midsection of the country. But the storms will be impacting areas much farther north than the previous rounds of severe weather we have seen during the last three weeks. Tuesday there is again a Level 3 out of 5 \"enhanced\" risk of severe storms from Dallas to Omaha, which includes more than 16 million people. While it is the area with the highest likelihood of storms, nearly 40 million people will have some possibility of seeing storms. \"Any thunderstorms that can develop in this very favorable thermodynamic environment will likely become severe quickly,\" the SPC advised. They mentioned any (strong thunderstorm) will be capable of producing tornadoes, saying \"some of the tornadoes could be strong.\" By Wednesday, we enter Day Three of this multiday severe event. The main threat area will shift east with the third day of a Level 3 out of 5 \"enhanced risk\" of severe weather. The bullseye will be from northern Louisiana to the south side of Chicago and include places like Shreveport, Little Rock, Memphis, St. Louis, and Indianapolis. \"Large to very large hail, damaging winds and tornadoes will all be possible,\" said the SPC. \"Strong tornadoes may occur.\" Dallas, Houston, New Orleans, and Chicago could all see storms as well. The good news is the severe threat will be over in time for Easter weekend. We could still see some lingering showers in the eastern half of the country, and some mountain snow in the Rockies, which could affect egg hunts and sunrise services. While things could change between now and then, right now the SPC doesn't have any areas highlighted for severe weather during Easter weekend as of now. As if severe storms and blizzard conditions weren't enough of a headline this week, extremely cold air will follow the front, plunging overnight temperatures into the single digits is forecast for portions of the northern Plains. \"Low temperatures in the single digits are possible and this could cause issues,\" said the NWS office in Billings. \"Do not be deceived by the sun, it is going to be fighting a very cold airmass.\" And as the climate crisis continues to change the dynamics of our weather, expect atmospheric rivers to become more intense as well. \"It's expected that as the air temperatures increase, the air can hold more water vapor and therefore any storms that are comprised of water vapor will have more of it,\" Cordeira explained. \"So, an atmospheric river, which is defined as a region of water vapor, will likely become more intense. Their frequency may not be more common, but their intensity could become larger.\" The drought-stricken West is getting even drier, according to the latest . \"Central Washington, Idaho, and northwest Montana also saw increases in drought extent or severity as short-term dryness continues to build upon long-term moisture deficits extending back to last year,\" according to the drought monitor. \"Many parts of southern Idaho, and the rest of the West, have set records for the driest three-month period (January to March) going back 100 years or more.\" Texas is also facing extreme drought with 95% of the state in some level of drought. At 26,000 square miles, Texas has more \"exceptional drought\" area than any other state, per the latest US Drought Monitor. The 26,000 square miles of exceptional drought is larger than the state of West Virginia (or more than three times the size of Massachusetts). The drought is only making fire conditions worse. From Texas to Kansas, there will be an extreme fire danger especially on Tuesday, as dry conditions and winds topping 50 mph will cover the area.

While the Burgesses were charged before the Supreme Court overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that protected the right to abortion, the case highlights issues of digital privacy that could have widespread ramifications post-Roe. The teenager, who was about 28-weeks along when her pregnancy ended, told investigators she had unexpectedly miscarried a stillborn fetus and that she and her mother buried the remains, according to an affidavit in support of a search warrant. But police went on to serve Meta, Facebook's parent company, a search warrant. After roughly 300MB of data, including private messages between the two, authorities allege the 41-year-old mother helped her daughter obtain abortion medication in Nebraska, where abortions are illegal after 20 weeks. Celeste Burgess, who was 17 at the time of the alleged incident, will be tried as an adult. Attorneys for both mother and daughter declined to comment to CNN. On Tuesday, Meta spokesperson Andy Stone a statement on the company's website saying, \"Court documents indicate that police were at that time investigating the alleged illegal burning and burial of a stillborn infant. The warrants were accompanied by non-disclosure orders, which prevented us from sharing information about them. The orders have now been lifted.\" As much as Meta wants to , emphasizing that \"the warrants did not mention abortion at all,\" they still can and should do  to safeguard users' privacy. Instead, they've been (Stone said in a Twitter post that Meta had \"discovered some instances of incorrect enforcement and are correcting these\") and, according to a obtained by the New York Times, ordering employees not to discuss the issue of abortion in the workplace. Long story short: If big tech isn't going to protect women and girls, then we have to protect ourselves. That starts by obtaining -- and sharing -- knowledge about our digital rights. Like many of us, privacy experts on the court walls long ago, and repeatedly sounded the alarm about the of pregnant women, their abortion providers and anyone who assists them. With abortion bans and restrictions now in numerous states, prosecutors could increasingly rely on digital data to punish pregnant people for their choices. It's a catch-22: inaccessible health care and hostile abortion laws online to seek medical advice, financial support or transportation -- but these searches expand that can later be used to prosecute them. So what are the risks? In states where abortion is illegal, personal data can be from , like what happened to Burgess, or from a third-party data broker. Your period tracking app can flag a pregnancy before you're even aware, your texts and emails could provide incriminating evidence, and as more red states consider abortion , your location tracking data or electronic transaction records might reveal a trip to Planned Parenthood in a neighboring state -- and the government can use all of that data against you in court. Burgess's story is, tragically, one of many. Even before Roe was overturned, women's data was . It's particularly alarming that women and girls are targeted online when we are already at a to men when it comes to digital literacy. We know that American girls are to abandon computer science courses between the ages of 13 and 17. As they grow up, they're , and they are searching for online. It's no wonder that women comprise only a , and in those positions than their male counterparts. This digital gender disparity is why I founded Girls Who Code 10 years ago. Today, I'm proud to say we're on track to in new entry-level tech jobs by 2030. But that success doesn't just prove women and girls' appetite for STEM -- it offers a blueprint for the massive education effort needed to enhance young women's digital literacy and safety. Part of that effort must be learning and sharing the simple tips for safer online interactions: using encrypted communications apps like Signal, making phone calls via Google Voice, creating (and promptly deleting) new email accounts to coordinate appointments and transit. For the more complicated stuff, we should rely on and support nonprofits like , and , which mobilized to help us understand both technology itself and our rights using it. Over the past few months, they've assembled an arsenal of resources that specifically advise abortion-seekers about surveillance, providing them with best encryption practices and private internet browser recommendations. We can even consult the Department of Health and Human Services' new under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) for securing one's personal health data. We must urge our legislators to protect women's privacy by curbing abusive data practices and instituting stronger consumer privacy protections through proposed legislation like Sen. Elizabeth Warren's , or Rep. Sara Jacobs'  And if tech companies want to regain our trust, they must become . In addition to making end-to-end encryption the default setting in messaging apps, they can refuse to comply with requests for data that violate civil liberties, and even such data to protect our privacy. In all of this work, we must ensure digital privacy education reaches those who need it most. Historically, many , and have simultaneously  and are deprived of adequate healthcare, and other critical resources necessary for reproductive justice. We can't have true digital inclusion -- and justice -- if only some women can access this information. In Justice William O. Douglas' majority opinion in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), the court established the right to privacy -- and by extension, women's bodily autonomy -- within the \"penumbra\" of the Bill of Rights, that sliver of partial illumination between and \"full light.\" For so long, women and girls have had to assert our right to privacy -- in our phones, our homes and in our bodies -- in the shadows of the law and technology. By empowering women with a knowledge of our digital rights, we inch our way towards the full light -- where we have always deserved to be."},

Last month, Twitter's former head of security, Peiter \"Mudge\" Zatko, told Congress and federal agencies that the company's security practices pose grave threats to national security. As part of his disclosures, which were revealed by last week, Zatko claims that the company allows about half of its staff \u2014 which amounts to thousands of employees \u2014 access to critical controls, and one or more of them may be working for a foreign intelligence agency. He also alleges that the company does not adequately protect the security of user data, using servers with outdated software that are missing critical security features like encryption. What's more, he claims that he was discouraged from sharing the full extent of the company's security problems with its board. , of course, disputes the idea that it has big security problems. It told CNN that engineering and product teams can only access the production environment if they have \"a specific business justification,\" that employees use devices that IT and security teams oversee, and that if a device is running on outdated software, they can prevent it from connecting to sensitive internal systems. However, Twitter did not respond to questions about its alleged foreign intelligence vulnerabilities. A spokesperson told CNN that \"Mr. Zatko was fired from his senior executive role at Twitter in January 2022 for ineffective leadership and poor performance.\" The spokesperson also said, \"What we've seen so far is a false narrative about Twitter and our privacy and data security practices that is riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies and lacks important context.\" (Zatko contends that he was fired in retaliation for raising at the company.) This latest whistleblower report makes clear that social media platforms not only pose potential privacy risks to users, but also national security risks. Congress needs to urgently pass a law regulating what data social networks can collect, how they can share it, how they can store it, who can access it and under what circumstances. Lawmakers also need to give the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) a specific mandate to closely oversee social media companies' security and privacy practices. That would ensure that these companies follow any new regulations put in place. We simply can't trust them to maintain their own data collection and sharing and security standards. Consider the ramifications of a social media company's inadequate security protocols. If a company lacks proper safeguards to protect user passwords or employees' accounts, the accounts of legitimate sources such as high-profile people could be taken over and used to issue dangerous, even deadly, claims or directives. Recall that, in 2020, hackers took control of the Twitter accounts of people like Elon Musk, Bill Gates and Barack Obama to promote , and were tricked into forking over more than $100,000. The hackers accomplished this by targeting employees who had access to internal tools and were able to post the tweets. Further, if a company lacks protections against how many employees have access to user information and safeguards to ensure that employees and users aren't hacked, then hackers \u2014 or even employees \u2014 could gather sensitive information about users from their social media data and share it with foreign intelligence agencies. Gaining access to their passwords or private messages can reveal evidence of things like affairs or abortions that bad actors can use to try to blackmail them into spying. Does it sound crazy to think that a Twitter employee would sell user data to a foreign government? Just this month, a former Twitter employee was found guilty of giving private information about Twitter users to the government of in exchange for money. That's why it's critical for social networks to limit access to sensitive user information, store and share as little user data as possible, and take every possible measure to prevent hacks. Zatko's allegations suggest, at least at Twitter, this simply isn't happening. Such threats are too serious to leave to social media companies to manage on their own. We need legislation that strictly limits the number of employees who can have access to user data, prohibits the sharing of that data with third parties, and requires companies to take stronger measures to guard against hackings. Congress needs to step in urgently to help protect social media users \u2014 and the country \u2014 from the possibility of these kinds of breaches."},

Monday's suit targets Kochava, a marketing data company that lists major brands including Disney, McDonald's and Hilton among its clients. The FTC complaint alleges that Kochava failed to protect consumers when it publicly published samples of actual consumer data on Amazon's cloud services marketplace, and offered even more data to those who paid. In a statement Monday, Kochava said it has spent the past several weeks trying to explain its practices to the FTC, adding that it is currently rolling out a new feature called Privacy Block that \"effectively removes\" the sensitive location data from the data marketplace. The company's general manager, Brian Cox, accused the FTC of \"flamboyant press releases and frivolous litigation\" and said Kochava complies with all laws and privacy regulations. \"Unfortunately the only outcome the FTC desired was a settlement that had no clear terms or resolutions and redefined the problem into a moving target,\" Cox said. The suit comes amid mounting scrutiny of data brokers, tech platforms and other companies that handle consumers' location data generated by smartphones and other devices, as privacy advocates have warned new state laws restricting abortion could lead to abortion-seekers' location histories being used against them as evidence of wrongdoing. According to the FTC, Kochava's data had not been anonymized, so by combining its location records with data from other sources, it would be possible to deduce a person's actual identity based on the information Kochava was offering. In conducting the investigation that led to the suit, the FTC said it analyzed a Kochava sample set that covered more than 60 million unique mobile devices over the span of a single week. Kochava's data includes precise, timestamped latitude and longitude information for individual consumers, according to the complaint, which highlighted data linked to one specific person to illustrate how revealing the information can be. \"The data may be used to identify consumers who have visited an abortion clinic and, as a result, may have had or contemplated having an abortion,\" the complaint said. \"In fact, in just the data Kochava made available in the Kochava Data Sample, it is possible to identify a mobile device that visited a women's reproductive health clinic and trace that mobile device to a single family residence. The data set also reveals that the same mobile device was at a particular location at least three evenings in the same week, suggesting the mobile device user's routine. The data may also be used to identify medical professionals who perform, or assist in the performance, of abortion services.\" Under its charter, the FTC is authorized to prosecute unfair or deceptive business practices. In this case, the agency alleges that Kochava's data practices are unfair because the practices could cause harm to consumers they cannot avoid. In the wake of the Supreme Court's decision rolling back federal abortion rights this year, the FTC has signaled an increasing focus on protecting health-related data. Following a White House that called on the FTC to protect abortion seekers' privacy, the agency that it would hold data brokers and others accountable for misuse of data or mischaracterizations of data policies. Regulators at the agency are also mulling that could have sweeping ramifications for how businesses can collect, use and share personal information, including location information."},

But despite covering more than of the Earth's surface, the ocean is still a relative mystery. In fact, we know more about the than we do about the sea floor; just over of the ocean bed has been mapped. Getting a fuller picture would enable us to navigate ships more safely, create more accurate climate models, lay down telecommunication cables, build offshore windfarms and protect marine species -- all part of what's known as the \"blue economy,\" projected to be worth by 2030. Underwater robotic vehicles equipped with sensors are helping gather that data quicker and more cheaply than ever before. But many of these vehicles rely on batteries with a limited lifespan, and need to return to a boat or the shore to recharge, making it difficult for them to map more remote parts of the sea. A five-year-old startup called is rising to the challenge, founded by oceanographer Yi Chao. While working at NASA, he developed technology to power ocean robots by harnessing \"the naturally occurring temperature difference\" of the sea, Chao told CNN Business. The power module can be installed on existing data-gathering robots or Seatrec's own floating device. This dives a kilometer down to examine the chemistry and shape of the seabed, using sonar to create a map of the surrounding area. The robot returns to the surface to send back its findings via satellite. As the float moves between colder and warmer parts of the ocean, material inside the module either melts or solidifies, causing pressure that in turn creates thermal energy and powers the robot's generator. \"They get charged by the sea, so they can extend their lifetime almost indefinitely,\" Chao said. A basic float model typically costs around $20,000. Attaching Seatrec's energy system adds another $25,000, Chao said. But the access to free, renewable energy and the ability to stay in the water longer makes data gathering up to five times cheaper in the long run, according to Chao. He said the startup is making fewer than 100 devices per year, primarily for marine researchers, but the technology is easily scalable -- Seatrec's energy module can also be can be retrofitted onto existing mapping devices to extend their range. New technologies that can extend the reach of data-gathering devices are crucial for mapping more remote parts of the deep sea, according Jamie McMichael-Phillips, director of the Nippon Foundation-GEBCO . \"One of the huge challenges we have is quite simply physics,\" said McMichael-Phillips. \"Unlike mapping the Earth's surface where we can use a camera [or] satellites, at sea, light does not penetrate through the water column. So we're pretty much limited to using sonar systems.\" Launched in 2017, the Seabed 2030 Project has increased awareness about the importance of the ocean floor, and given researchers and companies a clear goal to work towards: map the entire seafloor by the end of this decade. Some companies, such as , are surveying the ocean from the surface. Another startup, Bedrock Ocean Exploration, says it can provide surveys of seabed areas up to 10 times faster than traditional methods by using an autonomous electric submarine fitted with sonars, cameras and lasers; the data is then analyzed on Bedrock's own cloud platform. Even with the growing number of technologies accelerating seabed exploration, completing the map is still a logistical and financial challenge. Chao estimates that it would take 3,000 of Seatrec's floats operating over the next 10 years to fully survey the ocean. The company has raised in seed funding to scale up production of its energy harvesting system. But this is a drop in the ocean of the capital needed to fully survey the ocean, which is estimated to be \"somewhere between $3 to $5 billion,\" according to McMichael-Phillips -- \"pretty much the same order of magnitude as the cost of sending a mission to Mars.\" Bedrock's DiMare believes it's time we start investing in our own planet. \"If we want to keep Earth as a place that humans can live,\" he said, \"we have got to get a lot smarter about what's going on in the ocean.\""},

Is it quickest to get the train or the bus? What about a taxi or a city bike? Which provider has the nearest e-scooter? It can be inconvenient and time consuming. Which is why Finnish startup MaaS Global decided to aggregate all these services into one app called Whim. Available in more than 10 cities across Europe and Asia, users can access taxis, buses, bikes, e-scooters and rental cars. \"Whim's sole purpose is to compete against car ownership,\" CEO Sampo Hietanen tells CNN Business. According to the International Energy Agency, transport is responsible for , most of which come from . If Whim can persuade users to trade their car keys for a single app offering multiple transport options, the environmental impact could be enormous, says Hietanen. He admits this isn't an easy task. To succeed Whim has to be more convenient and cheaper than owning a car. \"The car represents freedom of mobility,\" says Hietanen \u2014 even if a city dweller barely uses it, they still keep it parked outside as a \"freedom insurance.\" To compete, Whim offers rental cars and taxis, but Hietanen says that users tend to opt for public transport or micromobility (shared lightweight vehicles such as bikes or e-scooters). Users can choose between multiple tiers of service, including a pay-as-you-go option and a 30-day season ticket, which costs \u20ac62 ($73) in Helsinki \u2014 where the app is most established \u2014 for unlimited public transport and short taxi rides. The ticket also offers car rental from \u20ac55 ($65) per day. While Helsinki has well-developed alternatives to driving, that's not true of everywhere. If a city \"does not have a wide public transport system or a lot of rental cars or taxis in place\" then it will be difficult to convince people to give up their cars, says Maria Kamargianni, associate professor of transport and energy at University College London. She says apps like Whim represent the first step in tempting people away from car ownership, and adds that the availability of alternative transport options is likely to improve as the market matures. Research firm predicts the global mobility service market will grow from $4.7 billion in 2020 to $70.4 billion by 2030. Other providers include Citymapper, which for Londoners in 2019, and Moovit, which launched an in Israel last year. Whim, launched in 2016, is one of the earliest providers and has raised more than $60 million from investors such as  ,  and Toyota Financial Services. It's available in several European cities and in Tokyo, and has racked up 18 million trips globally since launch. But the business has been hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, says Hietanen; with fewer people traveling, revenues are lower, stalling the company's expansion into other cities. Finnish newspaper recently reported that the company had spent \u20ac50 million ($59 million) on failed expansion ventures. Hietanen says the money was spent on integrating multiple transportation providers, establishing market readiness in several countries, and developing the complex technology that underpins the app. \"We've known from the beginning that the investment needed to create this would be substantial,\" he says, adding that the company has recently secured further investment. Though the industry is in its infancy, Hietanen is confident the demand will be there. A from the International Transport Forum (ITF) says that mobility services will be vital in meeting the needs of a growing world population and fast-paced urbanization. But for growth to happen, \"people must choose it over other travel options\" such as private motor vehicles. This is already happening, says Hietanen. According to a company survey carried out in Helsinki, 12% of its users said that Whim had prompted them to give up their cars. \"People want the more sustainable solution,\" he says, \"but they still want the freedom of being able to go anywhere, anytime.\""},

Twitter has accused Zatko, who worked at the company from November 2020 until he was fired this January for what Twitter says was poor performance, of pushing \"a false narrative about Twitter and our privacy and data security practices that is riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies and lacks important context.\" Zatko is a highly regarded cybersecurity expert with experience in senior roles at Google, Stripe and the Defense Department. His whistleblower disclosure was first reported by CNN and The Washington Post on Tuesday. In his disclosure to the US government, Zatko claims Twitter suffers \"egregious deficiencies\" in its cybersecurity posture, deliberately misled regulators about its handling of user data and that the company is not living up to its obligations under a with the Federal Trade Commission \u2014 a legally binding order that requires, among other things, the creation of \"reasonable safeguards\" to protect users' personal information. The FTC declined to comment on the disclosure. Zatko's damning disclosure alleges that roughly half of Twitter employees, including all its engineers, have excessive internal access to the company's live product, known within the company as \"production,\" along with actual user data. It also alleges the company lacks the ability to defend against insider threats, foreign governments and accidental data leaks. \"A fundamental engineering and security principle is that access to live production environments should be limited as much as possible,\" the disclosure says. \"But at Twitter, engineers built, tested, and developed new software directly in production with access to live customer data and other sensitive information in Twitter's system.\" Twitter has told CNN its FTC compliance record speaks for itself, citing third-party audits filed to the agency under the 2011 consent order. Twitter added it complies with relevant privacy regulations and that it has been transparent with regulators about its efforts to fix any shortcomings in its systems. Zatko did not participate in the audit work and did not fully comprehend Twitter's FTC obligations or how the company was fulfilling them, Twitter said. The disclosure claims Zatko's staff were \"intimately familiar\" with Twitter's issues before the FTC and that it was they who told Zatko Twitter was never in compliance with the 2011 order, nor on track to become compliant. \"We absolutely stand by the contents of Mudge's disclosure,\" John Tye, Zatko's lawyer and founder of Whistleblower Aid, the organization representing him, told CNN. Zatko may be eligible for a monetary award from the US government as a result of his whistleblower activities. \"Original, timely and credible information that leads to a successful enforcement action\" by the SEC can earn whistleblowers up to a 30% cut of agency fines related to the action if the penalties amount to more than $1 million, the SEC has said. The SEC has awarded more than $1 billion to more than 270 whistleblowers since 2012. Zatko filed his disclosure to the SEC \"to help the agency enforce the laws,\" and to gain federal whistleblower protections, Tye said. \"The prospect of a reward was not a factor in Mudge's decision, and in fact he didn't even know about the reward program when he decided to become a lawful whistleblower.\" The whistleblower disclosure comes months after the FTC that Twitter misused account security information for advertising purposes in violation of the 2011 order. Twitter in May to resolve those claims, in a second FTC settlement. Now, Zatko's disclosure raises the prospect of yet another possible violation of Twitter's FTC commitments \u2014 an extraordinarily dangerous position for a company and its executives to be in, according to Jon Leibowitz, who was chair of the FTC at the time of Twitter's 2011 settlement. \"If the facts are true, they would constitute violations of the order and of the FTC Act \u2014 and that would make Twitter a three-time loser,\" Leibowitz told CNN in an interview. \"There would be no reason for the FTC not to throw the book at them.\" Of course, Leibowitz added, the FTC would need to conduct a thorough investigation first to determine for itself whether a new violation has occurred. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, chair of the Senate subcommittee on consumer protection and a former Connecticut attorney general, said in a statement Tuesday that Zatko's disclosures \"reveal that responsibility for Twitter's security failures rests with those at the top.\" He further urged the FTC in a letter to investigate the allegations, saying officials should fine and hold Twitter executives personally accountable if it's found they were responsible for violations of the FTC Act or Twitter's consent order. The FTC's own credibility is on the line, Blumenthal said in the letter, which was also sent to the FTC on Tuesday. \"If the Commission does not vigorously oversee and enforce its orders, they will not be taken seriously and these dangerous breaches will continue,\" Blumenthal wrote. Under its charter, the FTC is authorized to prosecute \"unfair or deceptive business acts and practices.\" In the internet age, that has increasingly meant going after companies that claim to protect consumers' digital information but that in fact fail to live up to their public claims or misrepresent those protections. Twitter's original 2011 settlement arose from where hackers were able to compromise weak employee passwords and misuse their access to take over Twitter accounts and snoop on private information, in spite of Twitter's public statements on safeguarding user privacy and security. Twitter's settlement was not an admission of wrongdoing. But it Twitter to create \"a comprehensive information security program that is reasonably designed to protect the security, privacy, confidentiality, and integrity of nonpublic consumer information\" \u2014 a commitment Zatko alleges has never been met. As part of its latest FTC settlement this year, Twitter committed to even more granular cybersecurity obligations including having \"access policies and controls\" for all databases containing user data, as well as for systems that either grant employees access to Twitter accounts or that have information that \"enables or facilitates\" access to internal Twitter systems. Those obligations are already in effect following a judge's signing of the order this spring, further heightening the potential legal exposure for Twitter. Despite Twitter's mounting regulatory requirements, Zatko alleges not much has changed at the company since the FTC's initial complaint more than a decade ago. \"Things actually got meaningfully worse,\" his disclosure to Congress alleges. The disclosure claims that even as Twitter was actively negotiating the second settlement with the FTC last year, the company, in an entirely separate incident, allowed the very same type of misuse of data for advertising purposes to recur. In response to more than 50 specific questions from CNN related to the disclosure, Twitter did not address Zatko's allegation surrounding that incident. It did acknowledge that its engineering and product teams are able to access Twitter's live production environment provided they have a specific business justification, adding that members of other departments \u2014 such as finance, legal, marketing, sales, human resources and support \u2014 cannot. Twitter also told CNN that employee computers are automatically checked to determine whether they are up to date, and those that fail the checks cannot connect to production. The stakes of the disclosure could be hugely significant. An FTC finding that Twitter has violated its order a third time could result in the harshest penalties the agency has ever imposed on the company. The FTC is also currently chaired by Lina Khan, a and of what she calls a \"commercial surveillance\" industry that profits off of lax national privacy rules. Under Khan, the FTC is considering drafting that could directly affect companies across the economy, including Twitter, and how they collect, use and share personal data. Should the FTC conclude a violation occurred, it would have two main options for holding Twitter accountable, former agency officials say. It could seek a third settlement with the company, or it could sue Twitter over the existing consent orders and ask a court for appropriate penalties. In the case of a settlement, the FTC could even seek to name individual executives \u2014 holding them personally accountable and forcing them to accept obligations on their own conduct for which they could be held liable if they or the company violate the order again. If it turns out that Twitter did violate its legal obligations, Leibowitz said, the FTC should \"very seriously consider ... putting the executives responsible under order.\" The mere threat of naming individual executives can be effective, he added. During his time as FTC chair, Leibowitz recalled, \"I can't tell you how many CEOs came into my office saying, 'Please don't name me. I just don't want to be named. I don't mind if I pay more money; I don't mind if my company is put under a stronger order. But I just don't want to be named.'\" Megan Gray, a former FTC enforcement attorney who has worked on some of the agency's biggest privacy cases, said the tools at the FTC's disposal are numerous. (CNN spoke to Gray prior to Zatko's allegations becoming public and without disclosing their existence, and then again on Tuesday after CNN and The Washington Post reported Zatko's disclosure.) \"Escalating fines, more compliance reports, more granular controls and restrictions on their lines of business,\" Gray said, ticking off a list of options. \"Or a requirement to get advertisements pre-approved by the agency, or excluding them from certain types of transactions.\" Twitter has cited its third-party audits as evidence it has upheld its FTC commitments. But in general, the way the FTC's audit requirements often work in practice can let companies off the hook far too easily, Gray said. For example, many FTC orders are written broadly enough to allow a company to satisfy its obligations based on, among other things, \"attestations\" that they are compliant \u2014 a pinkie promise, Gray told CNN. In reports to the FTC, companies conducting third-party audits may simply say, or cite statements by the company under audit, that the company is in compliance. From 2011 until 2022, Twitter's consent order with the FTC allowed for audit reports based on attestations. Then, in its second settlement this year, the FTC made the audit requirements more specific, barring Twitter's third-party auditors from relying \"primarily\" on attestations by Twitter's management. Even with those types of restrictions, there are still reasons to be skeptical of FTC audit reports, Gray said. That's because third-party auditors are paid not by the FTC, but by the companies being audited, she said. \"So the incentives are completely out of whack for the auditing companies,\" Gray added. Twitter told CNN that audits are just one of the privacy and security programs Twitter has to meet its FTC obligations. Many current and former FTC officials, as well as US lawmakers and consumer advocates, have pushed to give the FTC more tools for holding businesses accountable, particularly after the Supreme Court last year the agency's ability to seek monetary relief under some circumstances. Some proponents of tougher oversight for example, letting the FTC issue fines to companies for first-time violations of the FTC Act. Currently, the FTC may generally only seek to impose civil penalties on a company In the case of Twitter, negotiating a consent order for a third time may seem like an odd look, another former FTC official said, speaking on condition of anonymity in order to speak more candidly. But in the event it finds a violation, and as with any case, the FTC will need to weigh what it believes it can obtain from Twitter through a settlement against what the agency may be able to win from a trial court. There are risks to long, drawn-out litigation, where a court may actually award the FTC less, the former official said. \"Some people do think these orders are kind of nothing,\" the former official said, \"but they're not. Maybe in some cases they are, and companies don't take them seriously. But in a lot of cases they do, and the FTC can exact a lot of pain. A lot of pain.\""},

From data about which cell towers your smartphone has been communicating with to your specific GPS coordinates, your smartphone constantly gives off a tremendous amount of information on your whereabouts, the letters from AT&T, Verizon and other carriers show. For example, T-Mobile retains granular latitude and longitude coordinates of devices on its network for up to 90 days, and less-granular cell-site location data for up to two years, the company told the FCC in a letter dated Aug. 3. Verizon said it holds cell-site data for up to one year, while AT&T said it may retain cell-site data for up to five years. The company letters highlight how telecom companies, and cooperate with government requests for personal information \u2014 an issue that's received intense scrutiny in recent months as new state laws restricting abortion have prompted critics to cellular location data being used to prosecute abortion-seekers. In addition to sending official data requests to companies, government agencies have also resorted to simply buying personal data from the open market themselves, a practice US lawmakers have this year. That sensitive data, privacy advocates have said, can reveal whether a person may have visited an abortion clinic or sought other reproductive care, even if the location data was merely collected for the purposes of facilitating an unrelated call or mobile web search at the time. \"Governments collect information for many reasons. But, all too often, data collected by the state is misused and weaponized for other purposes,\" the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group, wrote in this spring. FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel didn't explicitly mention potential risks related to reproductive care or abortion in to more than a dozen top US wireless carriers in July. But the inquiries came less than a month after the Supreme Court's decision to overturn federal abortion rights in June, and amid heightened scrutiny of the many companies that handle location information and to law enforcement requests for that data in connection with abortion prosecutions. \"Given the highly sensitive nature of this data \u2014 especially when location data is combined with other types of data, the ways in which this data is stored and shared with third parties is of utmost importance to consumer safety and privacy,\" Rosenworcel wrote at the time. Last week, Rosenworcel added she has called on the FCC's enforcement bureau to investigate whether wireless carriers are doing enough to tell customers how their information is handled. There are many reasons a wireless carrier collects location information from subscribers, the companies told the FCC. One main reason is simply to operate the network as consumers would expect. But there are other reasons, too. For example, FCC rules require that carriers provide detailed information to 911 dispatchers in an emergency, down to a device's likely elevation so that first responders can more easily locate someone in need if they are on the fifth floor of a building. Carriers also collect location data for purposes that don't directly relate to the provision of wireless services. Verizon, for example, told the FCC it may use location data as part of an offering to third-parties that can \"develop insights to help estimate traffic patterns during the morning rush hour or how many customers go to a retail store.\" AT&T told the FCC it may collect location information in order to serve subscribers targeted ads. While in some cases consumers may be able to opt out of this data collection \u2014 such as with AT&T's advertising program \u2014 they generally cannot opt out of having their location data shared with law enforcement, the carrier letters said. \"Like all companies, we are required by law to provide information to law enforcement and other government entities by complying with court orders, subpoenas, and lawful discovery requests,\" AT&T wrote to the FCC. \"In all cases, we review requests to determine whether they are valid.\""},

She is not the only one. India has seen a huge boom in cryptocurrency trading since the start of the pandemic, even though authorities in Asia's third largest economy have for years expressed concerns about digital currencies, and even Entrepreneurs in the industry told CNN Business that the country has the potential to become a crypto superpower, since it is one of the hottest internet markets in the world, with , and hundreds of millions more yet to come online for the first time. India ranked second behind only Vietnam last year in a list of countries seeing the fastest growth in cryptocurrency adoption, according to a report published in October by blockchain data platform Chainalysis. While the government does not keep estimates of how many people trade cryptocurrencies, industry experts have suggested that the country may now have more than . The growth is driven by younger investors \u2014 mostly under the age of 35 \u2014 and many of them are coming from smaller cities and towns, founders of two of India's biggest crypto exchanges told CNN Business. According to Sumit Gupta, CEO and co-founder of exchange CoinDCX, many Indian millennials have started \"their investing journey with crypto.\" While 20 years ago, their parents chose to invest in gold, these youngsters \"are more interested in having bitcoin as part of their portfolio,\" Gupta told CNN Business, referring to the fact that traditionally Indians chose to park their money in gold or savings accounts. is both an investment and a cultural habit in India, which is one of the largest markets for the precious metal, according to the . It also considered auspicious by Hindus and Jains, and plays a fundamental role in many religious ceremonies. Mumbai-based CoinDCX became India's first crypto unicorn last year, achieving a valuation of $1.1 billion after raising money from investors such as Coinbase Ventures and B Capital Group. The company says 70% of its 10 million users are between the age of 18 and 34. Data shared by rival firm WazirX tell a similar story. WazirX also has over 10 million users, and called 2021 a \" \" for crypto trading in India. The company was acquired by , one of the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchanges, in 2019. Over 65% of its users are under the age of 35, according to a recent company report, and it has seen a \"700% increase in the number of participants from smaller cities like Guwahati, Karnal, Bareilly, thereby signaling the growing interest from rural and semi-urban areas.\" Pritish Kumawat, a crypto trader from a small town in the western state of Rajasthan, said that he now finds conversations about cryptocurrencies in almost every tea shop in his area. Often, the most engaged participants are college students, he said, adding that bitcoin's massive spike last year has fueled the frenzy in India. In November, bitcoin was trading at a record high of , but it has since fallen to around $43,000. In addition to bitcoin, meme currencies such as dogecoin and shiba inu are also popular among Indians, the WazirX report added. Apart from investors from smaller towns, both companies saw an increase of more than 1000% in the number of women users on their platforms, albeit on a small base. Gupta said that participation of crypto by Indian women has seen \"a massive upside\" in the past 18 months and is \"fairly high, fairly healthy, relative to equity markets.\" The company's data shows that 15% of their overall users are women \u2014 which is the as well. The excitement over crypto is rising in India despite the country's on-again, off-again relationship with digital currencies. The central bank has long expressed concerns that cryptocurrencies can be used for money laundering and to finance terrorism. A cryptically worded proposal posted on the Indian parliament website last year even suggested the government was exploring plans to \"prohibit all private cryptocurrencies in India.\" This year, however, started on a more cheerful note for enthusiasts. , the Indian government announced it would impose a 30% tax on income from virtual digital assets, which many industry experts took as a sign that crypto trading won't be banned after all. The government also said it would launch a digital rupee in the coming months. \"Taxation of virtual digital assets or crypto is a step in the right direction. It gives much-needed clarity and confidence to the industry,\" Gupta said at the time of the announcement. Siddharth Menon, the co-founder of WazirX, told CNN Business that following the announcement, his platform saw daily sign-ups jump by over 50%. He also noticed rising interest among Indian developers and other professionals in joining the crypto industry. \"I'm getting LinkedIn messages\" from senior executives in India, who are now more optimistic about the business, he said. In the past, Indian exchanges have struggled to hire and retain experienced people due to the lack of clear regulations. But the Indian government soon put a damper on the mood, by clarifying that the cryptocurrencies are not yet legal in the country. \"I am not doing anything to legalize it or ban it or not legalize it,\" Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in parliament a few days after announcing the tax rate. \"Banning or not banning will come subsequently ... But I will tax because it is a sovereign right.\" \"I think the government is not entirely sure what it wants to do from a policy perspective,\" said Anirudh Rastogi, founder of tech law firm Ikigaw Law, which works with crypto exchanges in India. \"It knows where it wants to land broadly. It wants to find the right balance where it is not disconnected from the global progress in blockchain and other tech, but it wants to also address concerns regarding cryptocurrency.\" Rastogi added that the \"extraordinarily high\" tax on crypto is a short-term fix, which will also acts as a deterrent to many investors. \"This rate is typically used to tax activities that are not considered economically productive, such as lottery,\" he said. \"So this could be an indication that the government wants to make revenue, but it does not see crypto trading as economically productive.\" For equities, India applies a 15% short-term capital gains tax if shares are sold in less than a year, and 10% if sold after a year. Gupta hopes that the government makes up its mind soon. India, with its vast pool of developers and enthusiastic young population, could be a \"superpower in the next five to 10 years,\" in cryptocurrency and blockchain industry, he said. \"What is missing right now is a clear regulatory framework,\" he added."},

Now, Asia's third largest economy is ready for the next big frontier in tech: Coming up with a new generation of software companies like Zoom or Slack. The Covid-19 pandemic has forced business around the world to make huge investments in digital infrastructure, furthering the influence of companies providing software-as-a-service, or SaaS. Businesses spent an extra $15 billion per week last year on tech as they scrambled to create safe remote working environments, . SaaS companies provide web-based applications that take care of everything from how secure the software is to how well it performs. Some of the world's most well-known SaaS companies include  , SAP Concur and  , the American behemoth that owns . India's software-as-a-service industry could be worth $1 trillion in value by 2030 and create nearly half a million new jobs, according to a compiled by consulting firm McKinsey & Co. and SaaSBoomi, a community of industry leaders. There are nearly a thousand such companies in India, of which 10 are unicorns, or startups worth at least $1 billion, the report said. \"This can be as big an opportunity as the IT services industry was in the 90s,\" said Girish Mathrubootham, CEO of Freshworks, India's best-known SaaS company. It filed for an last month, joining a string of other unicorns that are going public this year. Freshworks was founded more than a decade ago in the southern Indian city of Chennai. Like Salesforce, it provides software to help companies manage relations with their customers. It's also India's oldest unicorn in the sector, having raised funds from investors such as Tiger Global and Accel, and has more than 50,000 customers. The company was last valued at $3.5 billion in a 2019 funding round, according to data firm Tracxn. Other Indian SaaS firms have found traction by focusing on niche businesses. , for example, is a unicorn that builds software for the spa and beauty salon industry. Of India's 10 SaaS unicorns, six reached that milestone in 2020, and investors around the world are paying attention. Last year, investors pumped $1.5 billion into Indian SaaS companies, four times more than in 2018 or 2019, according to the SaaSBoomi report. Investors are excited about SaaS because of the \"massive adoption\" of software over the last decade, according to Mohit Bhatnagar, managing director of Sequoia Capital India. While India is a in the global SaaS market, investors say the country could eventually dominate the sector because of two things: its vast pool of English-speaking developers, and the relatively low cost of hiring them. Thanks to the rise of India's IT industry, software engineering has become one of the most in the country. \"India actually has one of the largest developer communities in the world,\" Bhatnagar told CNN Business. Many of them have worked at some of the biggest global tech companies. Abhinav Asthana, the co-founder of Postman, pointed to his experience working as an intern at Yahoo in Bengaluru as instrumental in the decision to build his product. He came up with the idea to build a tool that would simplify the API (Application Programming Interface) testing process. An API is a programming code that defines how two applications communicate with each other, and Postman says it has made it easier for engineers to work together as they design and build their APIs. \"We saw how software was created at these global companies, and we saw API was a key problem,\" Asthana told CNN Business. Now, Postman is India's most valuable SaaS unicorn, with a valuation of $5.6 billion. The low cost of operating in India is a big plus. According to a report by  , the salary of entry-level developers in India is 85% less than their counterparts in the United States. \"If you are building a SaaS company in the US, it is better to have a million-dollar client rather than a $10,000-client because you need to pay for sales and marketing in that country,\" said Prasanna Krishnamoorthy, managing partner at SaaS accelerator Upekkha. \"When you are serving customers from India, you can have these small and mid-sized companies, as well as large ones.\" Most SaaS companies focus on global clients, similar to the strategy that was followed by India's IT giants such as TCS and  . Investors see this as a welcome change, since most of India's oldest unicorns \u2014 from Flipkart to Paytm \u2014 have focused primarily on the domestic market. Almost 98% of Fortune 500 companies use Postman's products, according to Asthana, while Freshworks' first client was based in Australia. SaaS firms are much better placed to go global than e-commerce companies like India's Flipkart, for example. They write software once, and then are able to use it multiple times. \"For a Flipkart you need billions of dollars [to grow internationally], but for a Freshwork you need much less capital to go global,\" said Mathrubootham, who is also an investor in Postman. This is because e-commerce firms require a ton of money to set up physical operations elsewhere \u2014 they have to hire delivery drivers, rent warehouses and buy inventory. Bhatnagar of Sequoia Capital said that Indian software entrepreneurs \"mastered\" the art of \"remote sales\" fairly early. \"Honestly, in this last two years, the whole world has had to understand how to do better remote sales,\" he added. Despite the euphoria, there are some hurdles Indian companies have to overcome before they can deliver on the $1 trillion promise. Indian engineers trained in the IT services industry may find it hard to develop the discipline required to build a product-focused company. In IT services, \"you are selling bodies and you say yes to everything the customer says,\" said Krishnamoorthy. SaaS companies, on the other hand, have to say no to 99% of [potential] customers, he added. And India's startup ecosytem is still relatively immature when compared to Silicon Valley. Despite the massive size of some homegrown unicorns, Mathrubootham said that the country does not have a \"global tech powerhouse product brand.\" But he hoped that future SaaS companies can change that. \"It is my personal dream to see India as a product nation,\" he added."},

The commercial caused a storm on social media, where critics including various celebrities blasted its innuendo as making light of rape. Many said the timing of the advert made it particularly insensitive, as it was broadcast just a week after a case in which a 17-year-old was allegedly raped by five men in the southern city of Hyderabad -- against women and minority groups across the country. \"This advertisement is clearly promoting sexual violence against women and girls and promoting a rapist mentality among men.

Within 24 hours, the ministry had taken the commercial off the air and asked Twitter and YouTube to remove it from their platforms. In an email to Twitter, the ministry said the videos were \"detrimental to the portrayal of women in the interest of decency and morality\" and violated the digital media ethics code. In a statement Monday, Layer'r Shot apologized for the television advertisement, saying it \"never intended to hurt anyone's sentiments or feelings or outrage any woman's modesty or promote any sort of culture, as wrongly perceived by some.\" The brand said it had voluntarily asked all its media partners to stop broadcasting variations of the advertisement from Saturday with immediate effect. Even after the commercial was taken down, it continued to cause a controversy. Actress Richa Chadha was among those registering her disgust, calling the makers of the commercial \"filth.\" \"Creatives, script, agency, client, casting... does everyone think rape is a joke?,\" Chadha tweeted. Responding to Chadha's Tweet, Quantico star called the ad \"shameful and disgusting\" and said she was glad that the ministry has taken it down.

His plans went awry", "paragraphs": " As Covid-19 wreaked havoc around the world last year, the 39-year-old son of an Indian billionaire was laying the groundwork for a plan he hoped would eventually end the pandemic. Adar Poonawalla \u2014 the CEO of Serum Institute of India (SII), the world's largest vaccine maker \u2014 pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into his Indian manufacturing facility and committed to make millions of doses of a then-unproven coronavirus vaccine. That vaccine, created by Oxford University and  , was still in clinical trials at the time. Nobody was sure how long a vaccine would take to develop, let alone whether it would even work. \"It was a calculated risk,\" Poonawalla told CNN Business. \"But I didn't see the choice at that time, to be honest. I just felt I'd regret not committing one way or another.\" To make his plan work, Poonawalla first had to raise nearly $1 billion. And the lives of hundreds of millions of the planet's most vulnerable people were at stake, since SII had pledged to provide poorer countries with jabs. If the gamble paid off, Poonawalla would save countless lives and be hailed as a hero during a period of historic turmoil. His fabulously rich family also would stand to grow even more wealthy by profiting from a significant deal. As the world gave its money \u2014 and trust \u2014 to Poonawalla, things seemed to be going according to plan. The AstraZeneca vaccine received approval from UK regulators in December 2020, and Poonawalla became a household name in India. But soon it became evident how badly Poonawalla had miscalculated the challenges that come with distributing millions of vaccines in the middle of a once-in-a-century pandemic. His company's ability to inoculate even his own countrymen was thrown into doubt earlier this year as a devastating wave of coronavirus hit India. He's also failed to keep up with his commitment to deliver shots to other nations \u2014 the consequences of which have dented his reputation and shed light on the perils of such heavy reliance on one manufacturer. It's easy to see why some of the biggest names in public health chose to rely on Poonawalla. Few manufacturers can come close to the scale at which SII is able to produce vaccines. The company \u2014 which was founded by Poonawalla's father, Cyrus, 55 years ago \u2014 produces 1.5 billion vaccines each year for measles, rubella, tetanus and many other diseases. The jabs are mainly distributed to low-income countries worldwide, including India. Poonawalla estimates that just over 50% of the world's babies depend on vaccines made at SII. The Poonawalla family charted an unusual path to becoming one of the world's preeminent vaccine makers. They have bred and raced thoroughbred horses since the 1940s, diversifying into pharmaceuticals, finance and real estate over the last half-century. Cyrus Poonawalla is now India's seventh-richest man, worth more than $16 billion, according to the His son Adar took over as CEO in 2011 and has focused on expanding in . To prepare for the AstraZeneca vaccine production, Poonawalla said he spent $800 million on buying chemicals, glass vials and other raw materials, as well as ramping up manufacturing capacity at his plant in the Western Indian city of Pune. More than $250 million came from the company's own funds. Another $300 million came from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which SII with to provide discounted or free doses to low-income countries. The rest was paid by other countries once SII started accepting orders for vaccines. In total, SII agreed to make up to 200 million vaccine doses for as many as 92 countries, as part of its deal with the Gates Foundation and Gavi, a vaccine alliance. All of that happened, though, before regulators signed off on the AstraZeneca vaccine. Had trials for that vaccine been unsuccessful, SII would \"just be making batches and then end up throwing them away,\" Poonawalla said. A business studies graduate of London's University of Westminster, Poonawalla said SII was able to make that decision more swiftly than many other companies, since it is a family-run business. \"The flexibility of being able to decide on the spot very quickly was really the main game-changer that enabled us to be able to do this,\" said Poonawalla, whose office in India is a refurbished . After the vaccine, Poonawalla began supplying doses to Indians and other other countries. By May, Gavi had received some 30 million jabs from SII. But Poonawalla's plans soon went awry when a second wave of Covid-19 hit India in the spring. At its peak the country was reporting over per day, though say the actual number was likely much higher. At that point, only percent of India's 1.3 billion population was fully vaccinated, and the country's national government had been slow in placing orders for more vaccines. Without a massive stockpile, states in India began to run out of the limited number of jabs they had. India then decided to the export of all vaccines, preventing SII from keeping up with its commitments elsewhere. \"I've always been a patriot for my country ... and if my country needs my facility first, I have to do what they say,\" Poonawalla said. \"There was no two ways about that.\" The inability to export vaccines hurt some of the poorest nations in the world. The director of Africa's disease control body, for example, warned India's hold on exports could be \" \" for the continent. People in several countries, from neighboring Nepal to , were left stranded after receiving the first dose of Covishield, the name of the India-manufactured vaccine. When asked why the global vaccine alliance chose to rely so heavily on one manufacturer, a Gavi spokesperson told CNN Business it had few options. At the start of 2021, \"very few vaccines were approved and available for deployment,\" the spokesperson said, adding that it was \"natural\" that SII would be contracted for early doses given its size. But public health expert Jeffrey Lazarus said there were flaws in the plan. \"Relying on one manufacturer was a mistake, which is easier to see in hindsight,\" said Lazarus, who heads the health systems research group at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health.

They point out Poonawalla hasn't delivered the number of jabs he initially promised, and they claim he hasn't been transparent about how he's been using all of the money he raised for the big vaccine push. \"There isn't much accountability for where the money he raised went,\" Malini Aisola, co-convenor of health sector watchdog All India Drug Action Network, told CNN Business. In June last year, it would make one billion doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine for low and middle income countries, with 400 million doses ready by the end of 2020. But by January 2021, the company had a stockpile of just . His critics weren't impressed, given the amount of capital he raised last year. The global media coverage also turned , with linking the global shortfall in vaccines to SII's problems, including the India export ban and a fire at the company's Pune facility. At the time Poonawalla said the fire had on Covishield production. But he has since saying that the incident has played a major role in hampering manufacturing. He also insists he was realistic about his goals. \"We always underpromise,\" Poonawalla told CNN Business, when asked whether the company pledged more than it could deliver. Still, he's been dogged by other controversies that have dented his reputation. As India's Covid-19 cases were skyrocketing in April, Poonawalla lowered the price of his vaccine and referred to the move as a \" \" \u2014 leading to heavy criticism, with activists pointing out that even a small profit is still a profit for SII. \"AstraZeneca has pledged that it won't from low income and middle income countries during the pandemic, but that does not seem to apply to SII,\" Aisola said. According to AstraZeneca, the companies the drugmaker has sublicensing agreements with, including SII, dictate their own prices. SII declined to comment on how much it has profited from the vaccine efforts so far, but Poonawalla said it is a \"very unreasonable and naive way of looking at the world\" for people to expect companies not to profit from the vaccine. While Poonawalla has yet to match his lofty goals, there is a chance that he and SII can get back on track, which is critical to ending vaccine inequality worldwide. India has decided to begin exporting vaccines once again as its own rate of inoculation increases. The nation had administered doses by October \u2014 about 90% of which came from SII, according to the company. SII also says that it has increased its production to 220 million doses a month as of October. SII is also expanding its partnerships, having signed a deal with American biotech firm Novavax to manufacture its Covid-19 vaccine, which is awaiting regulatory approvals. It's also partnering with the Russian Direct Investment Fund on production of the Sputnik vaccine."},

Apple has some famously loyal customers. Yet as broader economic forecasts get left and right, it might be a hard time to convince people to upgrade their iPhones. \"Apple faces a real conundrum of pricing,\" said Ben Wood, chief analyst at market research firm CCS Insight. On top of inflation and cost-of-living pressures wreaking havoc on consumers, he noted that Apple simultaneously faces rising costs associated with iPhone components and transportation. \"My expectation is that Apple will probably have to nudge prices up,\" Wood told CNN Business. But given the strain consumers are facing, he thinks Apple will also do \"everything they can to make that as minimal as possible.\" Beyond the broader signals of a worsening economy, Apple is also facing other headwinds as it prepares for the product launch next week. Supply chain hiccups stemming from China's zero-Covid policy were partly linked to the company's reported last month. Apple CEO Tim Cook said on the earnings call, however, that there was \"no obvious evidence of macroeconomic impact\" to iPhone sales. Cook added that the company even set a third-quarter record \"for both revenue and switchers to iPhone,\" adding that \"customers continue to find that iPhone remains the gold standard for smartphones.\" Steadfast iPhone sales are linked in part to other the predictions from some industry insiders that Apple will hike up the price of its newest iPhones -- though it is difficult to predict by just how much. Ming-Chi Kuo, an influential Apple analyst based in Asia, earlier this month that he expects Apple to raise the average selling price of the iPhone 14 lineup by some 15% compared to the iPhone 13 lineup. (Currently, the regular, non-mini, iPhone 13 starts at $799, the iPhone 13 Pro starts at $999 and the iPhone 13 Pro Max starts at $1,099.) In a research note Monday, analysts Dan Ives and John Katsingris of Wedbush Securities predicted that Apple would raise the price of its newest higher-end models by some $100. \"We believe a $100 price increase on the iPhone 14 Pro/Pro Max is likely in store given component price increases as well as added functionality on this new release,\" the note stated. The cameras on the upcoming iPhone Pro models are rumored to be upgraded to possibly justify the price increase, among other enhancements. The Wedbush analysts also predicted strong underlying demand for the next iPhone, estimating that some 240 million out of 1 billion iPhone users worldwide have not upgraded their phones in over three and a half years. Wood also noted that Apple's iPhones are in some ways insulated from macroeconomic pressures. Consumers are also increasingly looking at smartphones as \"almost essential,\" compared to some other tech gadgets. \"Whether you really need an iPhone or not, that's open to questions, but people who have an iPhone already are unbelievably loyal,\" Wood said. \"I think that Apple has some advantages over rivals,\" he added. \"There are people who are always waiting for a new iPhone.\" Apple, in its famously tight-lipped fashion during the the lead-up to its product launches, did not respond to CNN Business' request for comment Monday on the latest iPhone prices.

Customers around the world are feeling the pain of higher prices. In the United States, the has risen at some of the fastest rates seen since the 1980s. Historically, when such high bouts of inflation have occurred, recessions and widespread job losses have quickly followed. And, in the past, that has led to \"stagflation\" \u2014 an unpleasant mix of double-digit inflation, declining economic activity and high unemployment. As the odds of a recession in the US grow, what are the risks that history repeats? Our baseline expectation is for the US to enter a recession in 2023. But we don't expect to see the stagflation that we saw in the 1970s and early 1980s. Here's why: We now have two of the three ingredients for stagflation \u2014 high inflation and low or no economic growth \u2014 but we are missing the third: high unemployment. The US labor market is on a tear and shows little sign of contracting, which makes a 1970s-style stagflation scenario far less probable. Consider the following: Much of the labor demand reflects a deep need for certain skills across a range of industries, and the labor supply remains insufficient for the jobs at hand, even with lower growth. Even if firms cut their job openings by 20% and increase layoffs by 20%, the US labor market will still be relatively tight, according to our own analysis. And some firms may be reluctant to let go of workers in this coming recession, fearful that they may not be able to hire them back. A danger of high inflation is that it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, making inflation stubbornly \"sticky.\" When people expect prices to rise even further, they will understandably ask for higher pay. (And during labor shortages, they often get it.) To make up the difference in their profit margins, employers in turn charge higher prices for the goods and services they provide, which in turn leads to demand for higher pay, feeding the wage-price spiral. This is what we saw back in the '70s, with anecdotes of employees negotiating double-digit annual wage increases over three years in anticipation of persistent inflation. That said, although measures of for the next 12 months have risen, most consumers, business leaders and the financial markets don't expect such inflation rates to persist much longer after that, according to and of inflation expectations, which have been steadily falling over the past five months after rising the previous two years. We're in a vastly different world today compared to the '70s. Supply-side issues are improving, inflation seems to already be contracting, and jobs are plentiful. Most important, the Fed has more credibility as an inflation fighter than it did in the '70s. The is aware that its recent aggressive rate hikes are still not restrictive enough when it comes to taming inflation. A lot of energy is spent analyzing the Fed and forecasting its next moves. At , we're no exception. We believe that, although the Fed was late in raising rates last year, it is now intent on bringing down inflation to its 2% target, even if a recession occurs. That likely means raising short-term rates to at least 4% so long as inflation remains well above 2%. No soft landing, but no stagflation either. In 2023, we will likely see lower inflation and declining real gross domestic product for a time. More layoffs will likely occur, and the unemployment rate will rise from its very low 3.7% rate, but perhaps not by that much. My base case has it remaining well below 5%, a \"job-full\" recession compared to the recessions of the past. This certainly does not look like the stagflation of the 1970s. It's clear that the labor market will likely stay strong, even if we end up in a recession."},

More than 4,800 Chinese companies listed in Shanghai, Shenzhen and Beijing have now released their earnings for the first half of the year. It was a bloodbath. As many as 53% posted a decline in net profit, according to data from Wind and Choice, two major financial information services in the country. That was almost as bad as 2020, when companies posted their worst earnings season on record as the country came to a during the initial coronavirus outbreak. Back then, 54% of listed companies saw their profit drop in the first six months. By another measure, though, the start of this year was worse. The number of companies reporting a loss hit a record high of nearly 900 in the first half. In 2020, about 780 lost money. An earnings crash in the world's second largest economy can ripple around the world. That's because Chinese companies are big buyers of commodities, technology and other products on the global market. \"We've already seen the impact,\" said Alicia Garc\u00eda Herrero, chief economist for Asia Pacific at Natixis, a French investment bank. Prices of oil and other energy commodities have retreated and semiconductor factories have started to see decelerating orders, she added. Experts blamed China's strict Covid curbs and a deepening crisis in the property market for the dismal performance of companies. \"The key reasons are mobility restrictions and a huge drop in sentiment associated with the demise of the real estate market,\" said Garc\u00eda-Herrero. Larry Hu, chief China economist for Macquarie Group, said the poor earnings reflected China's slowing economy, which was being dragged back by the real estate slump, the worsening Covid situation, and the weakening global economy. China has so far stuck with its , which often leads to strict restrictions on people's movement and of cities over a few cases. Travel to and from China is also limited. Shanghai, the country's financial hub of 25 million people, was placed under earlier this year. Since then, many other key cities have also tightened curbs on residents and businesses. On Thursday, Chengdu, a city in southwestern Sichuan province, following a spike in Covid cases. China's GDP expanded by just 0.4% in the second quarter from a year ago, the weakest performance since the start of 2020. Last month, several major investment banks slashed their forecasts for China's annual economic growth to 3% or less. Analysts are also concerned about that has swept across southern China recently, which had caused some provinces to shut factories to save power. \"Whether Beijing decides to start easing [zero-Covid policy] from March 2023, we expect the economy and markets to experience a difficult period, as people will be either disappointed about no real opening or be overwhelmed by a surging Covid infection,\" said Nomura analysts in a research report on Friday. China's most prominent tech companies are among those suffering. The second quarter marked an end to years of explosive growth with   for the April-to-June period.   For some other sectors of the economy, this year has already been the worst on record. Three of China's biggest airlines \u2014  ,  , and  \u2014 posted record losses, with a combined loss of 50 billion yuan ($7.2 billion) for the first half. They all blamed travel disruptions because of Covid curbs and a depreciating yuan, which has plunged 9% against the US dollar this year. A weaker currency hurts China's airline industry because it has to pay for imported aircraft, parts and fuel in dollars. The costs of servicing dollar-denominated debt also increases. Property developers are also among the worst performers so far this year, as the country's housing market has spiraled downward. The sector, which accounts for as much as 30% of its GDP, has been crippled by a government campaign since 2020 to rein in reckless borrowing in the industry. Property prices have been falling, as have sales of new homes. The crisis escalated in recent months, as thousands of disgruntled homebuyers threatened to stop paying their mortgages on unfinished homes, jolting markets and prompting businesses and authorities to take action to defuse the crisis. Country Garden, China's No.1 developer by sales, reported a 96% plunge in net profit in the first half, the most since its 2007 listing in Hong Kong. The company said it has been weighed down by \"forces beyond our control such as resurgence of the pandemic in various parts of mainland China and extreme weather, coupled with the downturn in the property sector.\""},

Competition is fierce in the video conferencing business, which means that there aren't any obvious buyers. And analysts say Zoom is still pretty pricey, even after the big stock drop.

But what about other tech firms that still might want a bigger presence in video? Could Zoom be a fit for  ? The Facebook/Instagram/Messenger/WhatsApp owner could potentially get a further boost to its video aspirations by adding Zoom. How about  ? There's an argument to be made to combine Zoom with Slack, which Salesforce agreed to for nearly $28 billion, to create an uber-workplace productivity app that could compete even more effectively with Microsoft's Teams. The major obstacle to any deal could be Zoom's price. Joseph Bonner of Argus noted that although Zoom shares are well off their pandemic peaks, the company still would be tough to swallow \u2014 even for a megacap tech with tons of cash. \"A Zoom acquisition is unlikely due to a number of factors,\" Bonner said in an email. \"The thesis in favor of acquisition would be to pick up the asset on the cheap since it's lost so much value in the past year. Still at a $24 billion market cap, it's not that cheap and an acquisition premium would push that toward $30 billion or more.\" Bonner thinks that price tag would likely scare off any big tech buyers, as would the possibility of any potential deal getting a tough review from regulators in Washington. However, Bonner said there's a chance that Zoom could be bought by an investment firm so that it would no longer be subject to the quarterly earnings report whims of Wall Street. \"Think private equity. That could be a possibility,\" Bonner said. Others point out that Zoom is hardly the only tech/software company that is dealing with a post-Covid hangover. The Nasdaq has plummeted due to worries about rising interest rates and recession fears as well. \"I don't think it's accurate to say Zoom is uniquely struggling right now,\" said Morningstar analyst Dan Romanoff in an email. \"All of software has been battered over the last 10 months.\" Romanoff added that Zoom is \"an innovative company with a great product.\" The problem, he said, is that at the height of the pandemic, Zoom was \"generating an unsustainable revenue trajectory\" and the stock was \"sharply overvalued.\" That said, a deal could be possible. Romanoff noted that a Slack-Zoom combination could make sense. \"I thought a couple years ago that Slack and Zoom should merge because there is no need for standalone video, phone, and messaging products,\" Romanoff said. But he's not sure Salesforce would want to buy Zoom after already paying up for Slack, noting that Salesforce has \"maintained that [it is] not looking to do further large deals at this time.\" There is one other possible wild card though Business software company Oracle. \"Oracle doesn't have anything like this in their portfolio and they have been serial acquirers over the years,\" Romanoff said. But he still thinks an  deal for Zoom is highly unlikely because he's \"not sure that their balance sheet would allow them to do such a deal or that they are in the market at all.\" Romanoff added that if any tech company wanted to make a bigger bet on video, a cheaper way to do so would be with communications software firm  , which has a market value of just a little more than $4 billion. Zoom could also look to go back out and make a deal of its own if market conditions improve. That could help the company diversify. \"I am in the camp that Zoom is more likely to be an acquirer than an acquiree at this point,\" said James Fish, an analyst with Piper Sandler. Zoom had actually hoped to make a big purchase recently when it cloud call contact software firm  in July 2021. But Zoom called off the deal just two months later, and CEO Yuan said that \"financial discipline is foundational to our strategy.\""},

There are currently around two jobs available for every unemployed person, and as a result, employers have had to raise wages to attract suitable candidates. That sounds like a good thing \u2014 and it is for Americans who are facing higher prices on everything from groceries to rent. But the Federal Reserve isn't very happy about it. In order to fight inflation, it needs to cool the economy, and larger salaries do the opposite. Higher labor costs can also get passed on by companies to consumers, and that means higher prices. This inflationary cycle \u2014 pay more and then charge more \u2014 is exactly what the Fed wants to squash. That's why it's paying particularly close attention to wage growth, which . If growth had continued to accelerate, the central bank would have more reason to aggressively hike interest rates at its meeting later this month. But we're not out of the woods yet. Wage levels are still elevated for the year, up 5.2%. There are a number of factors that add to higher prices \u2014 including supply chain and commodity pressures \u2014 but wages are the dominant driver of inflation moving forward, Aneta Markowska, chief financial economist at Jefferies, told me. \"Rising wages are creating a significant amount of inflation. Supply chain issues are expected to ease in the next year, but we're still left with this labor problem.\" The only way to get to the Fed's goal of a 2% inflation rate is to see wage growth decelerate sharply, she said. A 0.3% increase isn't enough of a deceleration. The US unemployment rate grew to 3.7% in August, coming in hotter-than-expected. The economy added 315,000 jobs for the month, topping analyst estimates of 300,000 but marking the lowest monthly gain since April 2021. Wage growth also eased to 0.3% for the month. Wall Street had expected a 0.4% increase. The Federal Reserve is looking for red-hot jobs growth to start cooling in its fight to ease inflation. The report lowered market expectations for a more aggressive interest rate hike at the Fed's September meeting, sending stocks higher. The numbers provided some relief from last month's jobs report, which blew expectations out of the water. More than half a million jobs were created, the most in five months. Average hourly earnings grew by half a percent month-over-month. In the weeks following the July jobs release, Fed officials took a more hawkish stance, saying that rate hikes would continue until inflation comes down and warning of upcoming economic \"pain.\" Fed Chair Jerome Powell cited the strong labor market as a cause of inflationary concern at . \"The labor market is particularly strong, but it is clearly out of balance, with demand for workers substantially exceeding the supply of available workers,\" he said. After the last Fed meeting in July, where the central bank raised rates by a whopping 75 basis points, Powell told me that he was closely monitoring wage growth. His ultimate goal, he said, was to bring inflation down and achieve \"a landing that doesn't require a really significant increase in unemployment.\" That's only achieved by slowing wage growth. Wall Street is currently pricing in . That's down nearly 15 percentage points since Thursday, before the jobs report was released. But there's still a lot of ambiguity around the Fed's upcoming policy decision. There's a lot of economic data to digest in the first half of this month -- in particular, inflation numbers for August -- and this is just one piece of a larger puzzle. \"The Fed will require further proof of softening before adjusting policy materially,\" said David Page, head of macro research at AXA Investment Managers. \"But on balance these figures are consistent with a 50-basis point September Fed hike.\" The US and China have finally come to an agreement on one of the biggest problems in global business: How Chinese companies listed on American exchanges should be audited. Regulators from both countries announced a deal last week that would allow US officials to inspect the audit papers of those firms. The breakthrough means that for now, more than 160 Chinese companies may have dodged the immediate threat of being kicked off the world's biggest stock market, . The US is wasting no time in getting started on those audits. Reuters reported Wednesday that officials picked  ,  and other companies for a first round of inspections beginning next month. US regulations stipulate that all companies on American exchanges must comply with requests to fully open their books by 2024 or they will be barred from trading in the United States. That's a problem for China. The country has been hesitant to let overseas regulators inspect its accounting firms, citing security concerns. The tension has already led some Chinese companies to retreat from US markets. Alibaba, whose shares have traded on the NYSE since 2014, outlined plans this summer to upgrade its Hong Kong listing to primary status, which it expects to take place by the end of this year. The long list of companies at risk goes beyond Alibaba and includes some of China's top tech giants like  , and  . The impending audit deadline has already led to a slowdown in share issues. US IPOs by Chinese companies have slumped significantly, with eight so far this year compared to 37 in the same period last year. The value of those deals has also shrunk. So far in 2022, companies have raised just $332 million through IPOs on US markets, down from nearly $13 billion a year ago. This deal is just a first step in formalizing audit protocol between the US and China. It's still unclear if China will actually comply. Last week, SEC chief Gary Gensler warned that companies still faced ejection if their papers could not be accessed by US authorities. \"The proof will be in the pudding,\" he said in a statement. Analysts at Goldman Sachs said this week that there's still a 50% chance of Chinese shares getting delisted. Either way, this isn't likely to have a big impact on other contentious issues standing between the US and China. But it does mean that China needs Wall Street. \"The US-China relationship reminds me of conflict-ridden relationships where at the end of the day, they realize they can't afford to get divorced,\" said Drew Bernstein, co-chairman of Marcum Asia CPAs, an accounting firm for Asian companies looking to enter US markets. I don't need to tell you that the work-from-home boom is going bust. The dust collecting on your  already did. Now, the return-to-work era is cornering its next victim: Zoom.

Traders don't have a crystal ball to measure the level of risk when they make investment decisions. Instead they depend on the VIX, or the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index. Known as Wall Street's \"fear gauge,\" the index is supposed to reflect the market's estimate of future volatility \u2014 or how fast prices will change \u2014 30 days out. An elevated VIX means increased fear and risk while a low VIX means the market is entering a less stressful period. That's why the VIX tends to move in the opposite direction of the market. But as investors churn through increasingly choppy markets, some analysts are worried that this trusted measure of forecasting is broken. The gauge, they say, doesn't work in an atmosphere heavy with uncertainty, which is when traders most need it. The VIX is worthless in forecasting the direction of stocks, Aaron Anderson, senior vice president of research at Fisher Investments told me. \"There's just no correlation to future returns. We've never understood why so many people accredit so much to the VIX.\" Markets have tumbled over the last four days, bringing the recent late-summer comeback into doubt. The VIX is just now catching up to that, and only sort of. : Thirty is considered a high benchmark for the VIX. The index floated around 20 and below \u2014 which would indicate less volatility \u2014 for most of August. It hit 25 on Wednesday. In theory, if the index were to predict future market moves, it would have risen that high ahead of last week's selloff, Scott Bauer, CEO of Prosper Trading Academy who worked for 15 years as a market maker at the CBOE, told me. Cliff Asness of AQR Capital Management agrees that the index has limited utility: \"The VIX tells us almost nothing beyond how much markets have been bouncing around lately \" In an analysis dating back to the 1990s he found that the VIX was essentially in line with the S&P 500. By the time an investor looks back and determines a VIX peak or trough, said analysts at Fisher Investments, they've likely already missed the corresponding turn in the S&P 500. Sometimes there isn't any connection at all. Fisher analysts pointed to 1995 \u2014 a stellar year for markets that had no correlation to the VIX. The index wasn't designed to be as useful to retail investors as it is for institutions, said Bauer. There's a whole cottage industry of derivatives built off it. When the CBOE first created the VIX in 1992, it was intended to be a way for traders to make money by predicting market volatility. It wasn't supposed to become the major fear gauge it is today.

The retailer announced that it had also managed to secure more than $500 million in financing to shore up its long-term financial problems. The stock closed down more than 20% lower on the news. That's a big shift from recent weeks when the long-ailing company was adopted by so-called meme investors, who use social media platforms to organize large-scale stock purchases. The meme-induced hype lifted Bed Bath and Beyond's shares from less than $5 at the beginning of August to more than $30 during the middle of the month. It's been volatile since then.

The crash occurred after the Cruise robotaxi making a left turn stopped in the intersection, thinking that an oncoming vehicle would turn in front of it. But the oncoming vehicle instead drove straight, striking the Cruise vehicle. Both the San Francisco police department and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration launched investigations. Cruise has said that the oncoming vehicle drove in the right-turn lane and was traveling at \"approximately 40 mph\" in a 25-mph lane before it exited the lane and proceeded forward. Cruise acknowledged in its recall filing that its robotaxi was not \"sufficiently reactive.\" Cruise spokeswoman Hannah Lindow declined to say what the Cruise vehicle could have done differently, and declined to release video of the crash. Nevertheless, Cruise said in a statement that it made the recall \"in the interest of transparency to the public.\" Cruise said in a document detailing the recall that it has already issued a software update that it says improves the robotaxis' ability to predict what other vehicles will do, including in conditions similar to the crash. Tesla, arguably a Cruise competitor in the long-term, has been criticized in the past for making software updates to its vehicles while not always issuing a recall. NHTSA has been more proactive on recalls of late and in a 12-day span earlier this year. Software updates like what Cruise did, often called \"over-the-air-updates,\" are generally to companies in the way traditional recalls have been, because there aren't costs for physical parts and the labor to install them. \"Automated driving developers are constantly revising their software, including to address potential safety issues,\" Bryant Walker Smith, a professor at the University of South Carolina law school who researchers autonomous vehicles, told CNN Business. \"It's to the company's credit that they treated this particular safety-relevant update as a recall under federal law.\" Cruise continued to operate its robotaxi service in San Francisco following the crash. But at some point after the crash, which Cruise didn't disclose, it disabled its vehicles' ability to make unprotected left turns and reduced the area where its robotaxis operated. Cruise has gradually reintroduce unprotected left turns since making the software update on July 6. An unprotected left turn is a turn where there is not a left-turn signal that indicates when it's a vehicles' opportunity to go. Unprotected left turns are generally considered one of the more challenging things that a fully autonomous vehicle performs. Waymo's robotaxis in Arizona, for example, to help minimize risks. Cruise became the second company to offer a fully autonomous ridehail service when it launched in San Francisco in February, but only during The collision that led to the recall occurred at 11 pm, according to Cruise's report filed to the California Department of Motor Vehicles. Cruise's robotaxis   but also have had shortcoming, including technical glitches and flaws like blocking a firetruck responding to a multi-alarm fire this April, according to the San Francisco Fire Department. Photos have of a group of Cruise vehicles blocking lanes on a San Francisco street. Developing and operating robotaxis is extremely difficult and expensive. Cruise has added shareholders in addition to GM, including Honda, Microsoft and Walmart. Cruise lost $500 million in the second quarter of this year, according to GM financial filings. GM CEO Mary Barra that the market for robotaxis would probably be several billion dollars once robotaxis rides were available for $1 per mile, cheaper than human-driven Uber and Lyft's, which are often several dollars per mile and sometimes more. \"It's very much going to be a big part of how we move from point A to point B because it's safer,\" Barra told Fox Business. NHTSA has no performance standards for fully autonomous vehicles like Cruise's, but has said it will pursue recalls as needed."},

Air travel has been slow to adopt clean energy, but while the next generation of aviators waits for commercial airlines to move away from fossil fuels, it doesn't mean they can't train with lower carbon emissions. The Velis Electro, the world's only electric plane fully certified and , is taking off as a greener option for trainee pilots. Manufactured in Slovenia by Pipistrel, the Velis Electro is a two-seater light aircraft designed for flight schools. The single-engine aircraft can fly up to and has a maximum speed of (113 mph). It has a flight time of around 50 minutes (plus reserve) per charge, with two batteries that take to completely recharge. Tine Toma\u017ei\u010d, chief technology officer at Pipistrel Slovenia, says that while the Velis Electro offers a range of advantages over regular aircraft, a key attraction is that many of the fundamentals remain the same. \"You can literally take this airplane home and use it from day one for whatever you were using other non-electric powered airplanes for before,\" he tells CNN Business. As well as producing no carbon emissions in the air, the airplane is quiet \u2014 around says Pipistrel, which is . Toma\u017ei\u010d says that as a result, it can fly at much smaller airfields \u2014 which are often nearer to built-up areas and closer to prospective pilots \u2014 without annoying nearby residents. Since it was launched in 2020, Pipistrel says it has sold around 100 of the electric planes, priced at \u20ac175,000 ($175,500). With surging gasoline prices and increased scrutiny of the carbon footprint of air travel there is growing interest in the segment. in northern Sweden has three Velis Electros as part of its private and commercial pilot license training programs, which use sustainably powered planes where possible. Around 30% of the flying hours required for a commercial pilot's license take place in the electric aircraft, Johan Norberg, head of flight training at the academy, tells CNN. There is \"a huge difference\" in operational energy cost, he says, estimating a 40-minute flight in the Velis Electro uses $2 to $3 of renewable electricity, compared to roughly $45 of aviation gasoline for the same flight in a traditional single-engine training aircraft, like a Cessna 172, using a Lycoming O-360 engine. Pipistrel says batteries need to be replaced after around 2,000 flight hours (an indicator on the batteries says exactly when) and the price for a new pair is approximately $20,000. Even with the cost of replacing batteries, Norberg estimates the electric aircraft is cheaper to run than the academy's diesel counterpart, although he adds that \"the long-term operational costs are still to be verified.\" Training for a private pilot's license costs ($14,500) at Green Flight Academy, about the same as at flight schools that use conventional aircraft. \"When we can do a larger portion of training in electric airplanes there will be a significant cost cut to the whole training program,\" explains Norberg. In addition to shorter flights, qualifying for a private license requires pilots to undertake two-hour flights, says Norberg, which aren't currently possibly in the Velis Electro. But developing the next generation of electric aircraft with longer flight times could mean that within a few years, pilots might be able to train entirely without burning fossil fuel. Pipistrel was acquired this year by American conglomerate (owner of the Cessna and Lycoming brands), and is now part of . The global electric aircraft market is expected to quadruple , according to market research firm Precedence Research -- which estimates the value could reach nearly $40 billion by the end of the decade. The Velis Electro is currently awaiting approval for commercial use in the US by the Federal Aviation Administration, but it is already being flown privately. While trainee pilots are now getting the opportunity to fly green, large aircraft have yet to be weaned off fossil fuels, and zero-carbon long-haul and cargo flight is a way off. But Toma\u017ei\u010d is hopeful that won't always be the case. \"What (the) Velis Electro is already doing today is training the generation of pilots who will fly these large green aviation products of the future,\" he says. \"Not only is it representing a change in technology applied to training, but it is definitely changing the mindset of future pilots who inevitably will want to fly cleaner, electrified airplanes as part of their pilot careers.\""},

The nation's unemployment rate rose to 3.7% from 3.5%, as more people entered the labor market looking for work, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday. The labor force participation rate ticked up by 0.3 percentage points to 62.4% but still remains below the pre-pandemic level of 63.4%. The August jobs report is among the key economic data the Federal Reserve will review when it meets later this month to decide how much to ratchet up its benchmark interest rate in order to stifle stubbornly high inflation. Thus far, the Fed has been battling soaring inflation While the economy is slowing and certain industries such as housing are showing softening amid a series of hefty rate hikes, the labor market has remained strong \u2014 a little too strong for the Fed's liking. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell the labor market is \"clearly out of balance, with demand for workers substantially exceeding the supply of available workers.\" Earlier this week, as the number of job openings hit 11.2 million in July, an increase of 700,000 from June, according to a separate report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Jim McCoy, senior vice president at staffing firm Manpower Group, characterized the current labor market as the eye of an \"economic hurricane.\" \"We have a calm center and lots of conflicting factors swirling around,\" he said. \"But effectively what we're seeing is that in spite of rising rates and supply chain issues that continue to plague [businesses], the jobs market is robust. There's a lot of pent-up demand for employees.\" Some of the biggest monthly employment gains in August came from professional and business services as well as the health care sector, which saw employment increase by 68,000, and 48,000 positions, respectively. The US economy has added an average of 438,000 jobs per month so far this year, after factoring in revisions that lowered June and July's employment gains by 107,000 jobs. \"I think it's reasonable to expect that we will not keep that pace up between now and the end of the year,\" said Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate. \"I think that we may well have seen the low for unemployment during this cycle.\" The average monthly job gains are robust, compared to pre-pandemic times when the monthly average was around 200,000, BLS data shows. But even the slower pace of August's increase would be considered acceptable to the Fed, said Brian Bethune, an economics professor at Boston College. \"I don't think the Fed wants to see things suddenly decelerate, nor do they want to see things move at too rapid of a rate for the economy to adjust,\" he said. \"What the Fed wants is the Goldilocks economy. They want it to be moving along at a steady pace \u2014 but not too fast; not too hot, not too cold.\" The strong labor market and job gains shouldn't be viewed as a net negative, Bethune said, noting that adding workers helps to ease supply-side constraints in goods and services. \"If the Fed goes and drives through the stop sign [by overcorrecting and spurring a recession], and we get a reduction in employment as a result, then we're going to get a reduction in supply \u2014 really not the right path to go at all,\" he said. This is the second jobs report released since the end of July, when the Fed's rate hike committee last met. Powell said last week that the central bank's decision in September will depend on the \"totality of the data and the evolving outlook.\" Among the biggest reports to land in the weeks to come will be the Consumer Price Index and Producer Price Index, which could help show the direction of inflation. The Fed is also closely monitoring wage growth, with Powell previously expressing concerns that continued gains could keep inflation elevated. Wage gains continue to be outpaced by the rate of inflation, The August report showed that the pace of average hourly earnings increased at a slower pace of 0.3% from July. That's the lowest rate of increase since April, for an annual growth of 5.2%. \"This is, no doubt, a welcome development for the Fed, but we shouldn't see this as a sign of an imminent Fed pivot toward looser monetary policy,\" Gregory Daco, chief economist for EY, wrote in a note Friday. Daco said that \"barring a surprisingly strong CPI\" reading, he anticipates the Fed will institute a 50 basis point increase at its meeting later this month."},

On Friday, the government boosted its permanent migration numbers to 195,000 from this financial year -- a rise of 35,000 people. Employers are hopeful they'll help fill gaps in the workforce, but with almost half a million vacancies across the country and an unemployment rate of 3.4%, a near 50-year low, many more are needed. The problem isn't only related to the Covid-19 border closures -- experts say the visa system was struggling even before the pandemic. \"I think the biggest issue at the moment is actually getting people into the country regardless of what the cap is,\" said Blair Chapman, director of Deloitte Access Economics. \"We're really competing on a global scale now with shortages reported all across the world and there needs to be serious thought given to how we actually attract people to Australia.\" Part of the problem is that hundreds of thousands of people are waiting for their visa applications to be processed, creating a disincentive for new highly skilled applicants who may have offers elsewhere. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says his new Labor government inherited a backlog of one million visa applications that officials are working to clear. \"Many of those (are) employees or potential employees who had agreements with employers for jobs ... and they have been waiting,\" he told CNN affiliate Seven news. At a jobs summit in Canberra, he committed 36 million Australian dollars ($24 million) to clear the backlog, but experts say the government could find itself in the same position as employers -- having too few workers to do the job. When the first cases of coronavirus were detected in early 2020, Australia shut its borders, restricting access to international arrivals so numbers didn't exceed the availability of hotel quarantine. Now, almost all Covid-19 restrictions have disappeared and from this week, positive cases only need to isolate at home for five days rather than seven. Australians barred from leaving the country are now racing for the border, and while more international visitors are arriving, the The lack of migration has created headaches for businesses -- forcing some to reduce their hours or services. Farmers can't find enough workers to pick their crops, hospital staff are working overtime, and construction workers are stretched thin across multiple work sites. \"It's across the board,\" said Zahan Mistry, the director of Easymigrate, a company offering migration and visa services. \"We're looking for people in IT, people in hospitality, in professional services, childcare workers, aged care workers, construction.\" Natureworks director David Joffe wants at least 10 workers for his sculpting business on the outskirts of Brisbane. \"Right now we're about to sculpt a giant 12-meter high cockatoo,\" Joffe said. \"We would love to build some horses here because we need some for Melbourne Cup day. There's also the lifecycle of a frog -- a series of 15 molds out there that we should be casting.\" But there just aren't enough people around to do the work. \"There are a couple of German backpackers living at Mount Glorious,\" he said. \"(But) everybody is grabbing them to try to get them to work on their house,\" he said. \"I'd love to get them, too, but they're busy.\" On the surface, Australia seems to be a strong option for skilled workers eager to relocate. The country's economy has rebounded from the pandemic and though the cost of living is rising, at 6.1% inflation is still lower than in the United Kingdom and the United States. Experts say Australia should be able to compete with Canada and New Zealand when it comes to skilled workers, but it doesn't. Australia's immigration policies are notoriously tough, but Mistry from Easymigrate said even for people with highly sought-after skills, the visa system can be frustratingly slow. \"It could take sort of eight to 12 months to bring someone in, so it becomes a big disincentive to businesses who are kind of looking for someone to start immediately,\" he said. Partner visas can take up to two years, he added. Mistry said the problems predate the pandemic, going back five years or so to when Border Force, the agency tasked with border control, was absorbed into a larger Department of Home Affairs. \"It seems to have been a very big culture shift from being about facilitating visas to one of more border protection,\" Mistry said. Australia's former Deputy Immigration Minister Abul Rizvi said around that time it became much harder for Australian employers to recruit foreign workers. \"What we did was make employer sponsored visas much, much, much more bureaucratic and made the processing of them very slow,\" he said. Rizvi said Friday's lift in permanent migrant numbers is positive, but it'll take time for the benefit to flow into the market. He said a sharp rise in student visa numbers could help fill vacancies in the short-term -- students have full work rights -- but he said in the long-term the country is \"going down the wrong path.\" \"We need to be selecting students who are interested in studying seriously and are able to study seriously, to complete a course employers value, and we'll give them a skilled job and a pathway to permanent residence. That's how the system works best,\" he said. \"At the moment, we're being sold by education agents around the world as the cheap work visa -- if you want to seriously study you go somewhere else.\" He said international students on low quality courses could find themselves stuck without a permanent path to migration because their qualifications aren't attractive to employers. On top of that, he said the processing system needs to get much faster. \"If you've got the world's best quantum physicist, you don't want to mess them around for two years. You want to get them quickly before somebody else grabs them.\""},

Fed officials, in particular, will be watching closely, as it is one of the last major economic data releases they'll have before their mid-September policy meeting. Here's what you need to know: Hold up \u2014 the Fed wants job growth? Seems counterintuitive, but, yeah. The Fed has a dual mandate to ensure maximum employment (which we have) and price stability (which we definitely don't have). And as Chairman Jay Powell reminded the world so bluntly in Jackson Hole last week, the Fed is going to keep raising interest rates (which makes borrowing more expensive, slowing business activity) until inflation relents. It's a long road ahead: Price surges are hovering around a 40-year high of 8.5%. The Fed wants to get that down to 2%. In effect, the Fed is wagering that the resulting pain of unemployment is less broadly harmful than the pain of inflation. Key quote: \"Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone.\" Of course, not everyone agrees with the Fed's strategy. Much of the root cause of inflation \u2014 supply chain disruptions, the pandemic, geopolitical tensions \u2014 are well out of the central bank's jurisdiction. Raising interest rates tackles the demand side (consumers will buy less) rather than addressing the supply side. \"What [Powell] calls 'some pain,' means putting people out of work, shutting down small businesses because the cost of money goes up,\" Senator Elizabeth Warren told CNN's Dana Bash last weekend. She's not wrong. Powell often euphemistically calls it \"softening of labor market conditions.\" What he means is higher unemployment, which means less consumer spending, which brings prices down. The Fed's trying to trade one kind of pain (inflation) for another kind of pain (unemployment). But Powell has repeatedly said that the labor market's strength is evidence the economy can handle higher rates. Of course, that's little consolation to the people whose jobs end up on the chopping block. A third three-quarter-point hike isn't a foregone conclusion. The Fed will have to weigh tomorrow's jobs numbers along with the results of the consumer price index, due out a week before the central bank's Sept. 21 meeting, to get a clearer view of the inflation puzzle. At least are on strike, including rail workers, lawyers, journalists and postal service staff, demanding higher pay as inflation soars to its highest level in decades. It's one of the most significant waves of industrial unrest in the UK since the \"winter of discontent\" in the late 1970s, when rampant inflation pushed workers to stage mass walkouts. Now for some not-terrible and relatively Musk-free news from Twitter, as a treat. It only took 800 years of pleading and begging but the Twitter gods have finally granted the world's request for a freakin' edit button. \"This is happening and you'll be okay,\" the company tweeted. (Ahem, AP style on that would be \"OK,\" instead of \"okay,\" plus it saves two whole characters! See, Twitter, everyone needs an editor.) This isn't a huge surprise \u2014 Twitter teased at it back in April, on the same day it announced Elon Musk would join its board (lol). (ICYMI, Musk accepted the board seat, then bailed a few days later. And then he offered to buy Twitter outright. And now he's in court trying to bail on that. Are you sensing a pattern?) The lack of an edit button has been an issue for as long as Twitter's been around. Facebook and Instagram have had it for years. Why, oh why, Twitter, did you make me suffer the public shame of my own misspellings and general carelessness? Apparently, some people worried about how editing could be weaponized, Like, say a harmless tweet goes viral and then gets edited to include harassment or misinformation? (To which I say, if you've ever to make a tweet go viral, you know how unlikely this scenario is. But I digress...) To avoid that misinformation potential, Twitter said tweets will be able to be edited \"a few times\" for up to 30 minutes after they are first posted. Edited tweets will appear with an icon, label and timestamp to make it obvious they have been modified, and users can click through to a tweet's \"edit history\" to see past versions. Good idea.

Finance ministers from the G7 group of countries \u2014 the United States, Japan, Canada, Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom \u2014 said they would ban the provision of \"services which enable maritime transportation of Russian-origin crude oil and petroleum products globally\" above the price cap. That could block insurance cover or finance for oil shipments. The maximum price would be set by \"a broad coalition\" of countries, they said in a joint statement. It would take effect alongside the European Union's next batch of sanctions, which include a ban on seaborne imports of Russian oil starting in early December. Russia had already threatened to retaliate by banning oil exports to countries that implement a price cap. \"We will simply not supply oil and petroleum products to such companies or states that impose restrictions, as we will not work non-competitively,\" Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak told reporters Thursday, according to state news agency TASS. The Biden administration has been pushing for governments to introduce a price cap for months.

But if the cap forces Russia to strike cheaper deals with trading partners by putting a ceiling on the price at which they can sell their products, it will still achieve its goals, the official added. Novak has called the proposals to impose restrictions \"completely absurd\" and said they could destroy the global oil market, TASS reported. \"Such attempts will only destabilize the oil industry, the oil market,\" he said. Russia could offer alternative insurance for its oil shipments. But the US Treasury official noted they would be more expensive, raising incentives for buyers to opt in to the price cap system. Flows of crude oil and other oil products to the United States, United Kingdom, European Union, Japan and South Korea have dropped by nearly 2.2 million barrels per day since the start of the war in Ukraine, according to the International Energy Agency. But two-thirds of this decline has been rerouted to , helping pad Moscow's coffers. Export revenues in July were about $19 billion, the IEA said. Russia's control of large swaths of global energy supplies remains a major challenge six months since its invasion of Ukraine. This week, Russia temporarily natural gas deliveries to the region through a vital pipeline and cut off all supplies to a French utility, exacerbating problems that have sent European inflation to a record high of 9%. Russian state energy giant Gazprom said that the cut in deliveries through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline was due to a planned shutdown for a few days for maintenance work. It is supposed to reopen on Saturday."},

The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted 13 to 1 earlier in the day to recommend updated mRNA boosters for Americans this fall. Walensky's decision means the shots could be available by Friday, according to pharmaceutical manufacturers, which began shipping the new doses after the US Food and Drug Administration authorized them Wednesday. \"The updated COVID-19 boosters are formulated to better protect against the most recently circulating COVID-19 variant,\" Walensky said in a statement. \"They can help restore protection that has waned since previous vaccination and were designed to provide broader protection against newer variants. This recommendation followed a comprehensive scientific evaluation and robust scientific discussion. If you are eligible, there is no bad time to get your COVID-19 booster and I strongly encourage you to receive it.\" The updated boosters have instructions that tell our cells to make antibodies against two strains of the virus that causes Covid-19: the original strain and the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron subvariants, which share the same spike. Pfizer/BioNTech's updated vaccine is a 30-microgram dose authorized for people 12 and older. Moderna's updated vaccine is a 50-microgram dose authorized for people 18 and older. The CDC said in the statement that it \"also expects to recommend updated COVID-19 boosters for other pediatric groups\" in the coming weeks. People are eligible for the updated boosters as long as they have completed all primary doses in their vaccine series. The committee recommended that the new boosters be given at least two months after the last dose of any Covid-19 vaccine and up to three months after an infection. The new formulations do not replace shots for the primary series. The boosters were approved based on studies in mice bred to have human ACE-2 receptors -- the doors the coronavirus uses to get into our cells -- but clinical trial data showing how well they may work in humans won't be available for another month or two. This is similar to the way annual flu shots are studied and approved, but it's the first time for Covid-19 vaccines. In approving the vaccines, regulators also reviewed data behind different two-strain boosters. Those carry instructions to fight the original strain of the Omicron variant, BA.1, along with the original virus. Those boosters have been studied in about 1,400 people. They have been authorized for use in the UK and Canada but will not be available in the US. Several of the committee members said Thursday that they were uncomfortable recommending a vaccine with no human data to back it. \"We're been extrapolating the data that has been seen with the bivalent BA.1, and hopefully, we'll have similar data for BA.4 and BA.5,\" said Dr. Pablo Sanchez, a pediatrician at Ohio State University and a member of the committee. \"So I'm just concerned about that extrapolation. And because and ultimately, I really don't want to establish a precedent of recommending a vaccine that we don't have clinical data,\" said Sanchez, who voted against the recommendation. That prompted a quick rebuttal from government experts who work with the committee. \"I just would like to remind the committee that every year, we use influenza vaccines that are based on new strains without clinical studies being done,\" said Dr. Melinda Wharton, associate director for vaccine policy at the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. Dr. Doran Fink, deputy director of the FDA's Division of Vaccines and Related Products Applications, said, \"I do appreciate the amount of discomfort that I'm hearing from committee members who are being asked to take this leap with the Covid vaccines that they haven't been asked to make previously with the Covid vaccines. \"FDA felt very comfortable with the approach of extrapolating the safety and effectiveness or rather the known and potential benefits,\" Fink said. \"We recognize that we've taken a different path than the regulatory authorities have in Europe and Canada.\" Fink said the US chose to go this route based on feedback from its independent advisory group and projections for the viruses that may be circulating in this country over the fall and winter. On Thursday, the committee saw new modeling data that suggested there were substantial risks to waiting to roll out new boosters. According to the CDC's forecasts, boosters given to US adults in September could prevent 137,000 more hospitalizations and 9,700 deaths than if the boosters were held until November. New analyses on the cost-effectiveness of the boosters suggest that the US could save at least $63 billion in medical costs between August and March 31 if as many people get these boosters as got flu shots during the 2021-22 season. In the studies that looked at the shot targeting BA.1 along with the original, the boosters broadened immunity against many variants, and they were proven to be better than the older single-strain boosters because they made higher levels of antibodies. Moderna presented tantalizing data suggesting that the two-strain shots it developed against the Beta variant might extend the length of protection people get from their vaccines, which currently drops off significantly after about four months. It said a study on these results was being prepared for publication In mice bred to have human ACE-2 receptors, the two-strain vaccines against BA.4 and BA.5 protected better against infections in their lungs, compared with the original vaccine. About two-thirds of the total US population is vaccinated against Covid-19 with an initial series, according to data from the CDC. But less than half of those with their initial series -- and less than a third of the total population -- has also gotten a booster.

Now, a battery-powered glove could help workers by taking some of the strain. The \"Ironhand\" glove strengthens the wearer's grip, meaning they don't have to use as much force to perform repetitive manual tasks. Its developer, Bioservo, says it can increase the wearer's hand strength by 20%. The Swedish company describes the system as a \"soft exoskeleton.\" Exoskeletons are an external device that supports and protects the body, typically increasing strength and endurance. Most have a rigid structure, but the Ironhand is soft, like a regular glove. \"When you have the glove on, it provides strength and reduces the effort needed when lifting objects,\" says Mikael Wester, Bioservo's marketing director. \"It's all in order to reduce fatigue and prevent strain injuries in the long run.\" The system consists of a backpack, which houses the power pack, and artificial tendons that connect to the glove. There are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object. A remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip. Wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry, using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses. Each Ironhand system costs around \u20ac6,000 ($7,275). The device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer's risk of developing strain injuries. According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, work-related neck and upper limb disorders are the , costing national economies up to 2% of their gross national product. The glove was originally intended for workers in a very different setting to the factory floor. NASA developed an early version of the technology, called \"Robo-Glove,\" to help astronauts grasp objects and carry out work in space. Bioservo licensed the design in 2016 and then partnered with auto manufacturer General Motors (GM) to develop the glove for its workers. \"Ergonomics is really the field of trying to fit the jobs to the workers, instead of the workers having to conform and adapt to the job,\" says Stephen Krajcarski, a senior manager with GM's ergonomics team. \"By using tools such as the Ironhand we are really trying to mitigate any potential concerns or physical demands that may eventually cause a medical concern for that individual operator.\" Krajcarski says GM has helped Bioservo to test and improve the Ironhand by piloting it in a variety of jobs at its manufacturing plants. He says some workers have found it easy to use but adds that it's not suitable for all situations. The Ironhand is just one of the exoskeletons GM is looking into. According to market research firm ABI Research, the exoskeleton market will grow from . \"If you look at exoskeletons, this is just one of the tools that are out there,\" says Krajcarski. \"But this is an exciting technology.\" This story has been updated to correct the cost of the Ironhand system."},
{"url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2021/07/14/world/tusimple-autonomous-truck-spc-intl/index.html", "title": "There's a shortage of truckers, but TuSimple thinks it has a solution: no driver needed", "paragraphs": " Right now, there's a shortage of truck drivers in the and , exacerbated by the e-commerce boom brought on by the pandemic. One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks, and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one. Among them is San Diego-based TuSimple. Founded in 2015, TuSimple has completed about 2 million miles of road tests with its 70 prototype trucks across the US, China and Europe. Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology, TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world's largest truck manufacturers -- Navistar in the US and Traton, Volkswagen's trucking business, in Europe -- to design and build fully autonomous models, which it hopes to launch by 2024. TuSimple's latest road test involved hauling fresh produce 951 miles, from Nogales, Arizona to Oklahoma City. The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver, but for the bulk of the route -- from Tucson to Dallas -- the truck drove itself. \"Today, because the system is not fully ready, we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we're testing, but we drove in full autonomy: the driver wasn't touching the wheel,\" said Cheng Lu, TuSimple's president and CEO. The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver, mostly because a truck doesn't need to sleep. \"In the US, a driver can only work 11 hours a day. We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation,\" said Lu. That, of course, negates the advantage of an autonomous system, so the idea is that once TuSimple's trucks hit the market, there will be no need to have anyone onboard. Unlike self-driving cars, which are a still , TuSimple trucks won't be required to operate in bustling city traffic, but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company's own software.  \"We collect data from the roads, and we create this very detailed, high definition map of each route. That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles,\" said Lu. As a result, TuSimple's trucks will only be able to self-drive along these pre-mapped trade corridors, which Lu calls \"virtual railroads,\" and nowhere else. According to the company, in the US 80% of goods travel through just 10% of the nation's trade corridors, so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business. TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas, and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024. Its plans are dependent on state legislation, however, because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads.  The technology will add about $50,000 to the cost of a truck, making the final price roughly $200,000. According to Lu, that's still cheaper than paying for a human driver. \"If you take $50,000 and divide it by 1 million miles, the average lifespan of a truck, that means you're adding five cents per mile. But you're saving the cost of a human driver, which based on average US wages is about $80,000 to $120,000 per year -- or 80 cents to $1.20 per mile. Today, the direct labor cost is about 50% of the cost of operating a truck,\" he said. That doesn't mean driverless trucks will take away jobs, according to Lu. By focusing on the \"middle mile,\" rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods, TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers, while at the same time protecting existing jobs. \"A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day -- that's not what autonomy is meant for. We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver, even if they enter the workforce today,\" said Lu. Instead, TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers, which involve long stretches of monotonous driving. \"Take Phoenix to El Paso: that's a six-hour drive. A person cannot make the round trip, because it's more than 11 hours. But the truck can go back and forth all day, the most mundane job that drivers don't want to do. That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile (pickup and delivery).They get to work a full day, which is a more efficient use of their time, and they get to go home at night to their family,\" said Lu. Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased, TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests, without a human safety driver in the cabin at all, before the end of the year. The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024. Lu says that 7,000 have been reserved in the US alone.  TuSimple has prominent competitors, such as Google spinoff Waymo and Uber-backed Aurora, but those are working on a wider range of self-driving vehicles, including passenger cars. TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks, like US companies Plus and Embark.  Grayson Brulte, an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte & Co., believes TuSimple is on the right track. \"The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose-built for trucking. They're not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class-8 trucks. These are different skills and different systems altogether,\" he said.  Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits. The company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers, and can see farther down the road, even at night. \"In the US every year there are about 5,000 fatalities involving trucks, and most are due to human error,\" said Lu. \"The truck doesn't get tired, doesn't watch a movie or look at a phone. It doesn't get distracted.\""},

The sister of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was speaking at the Global Supertrends Conference 2022 on Wednesday. The Web3 is a hypothetical, future version of the internet based on blockchain technology \u2014 an \"ideal utopia,\" said Zuckerberg. \"But \u2026 that's not what's happening. What's happening in reality, is chaos.\" The founder and CEO of Zuckerberg Media, a production company and marketing consultancy, added, \"You're the only one watching your own back and your own assets, people are spending time protecting themselves by setting up so many different wallets and protecting their identity and that's not contributing to development in the area.\" Zuckerberg, who was an early employee at Meta \u2014 formerly known as Facebook \u2014 explained that various metaverses are now acting as \"their own walled garden,\" in which users are unable to use their assets across platforms. The metaverse can be loosely defined as a virtual world where people live, work and play. With cryptocurrency, users can buy and develop virtual land or dress their own avatars. \"Right now, I'm on Decentraland, my son is on Roblox, my other son is on Fortnite. That's great \u2014 we're all in the metaverse. [But] we have no interaction with one another,\" she said. \"In order to really unlock the potential [of Web3], we're going to need to figure out a system where there's interoperability. What you have goes with you wherever you are, [and] we're not there yet,\" Zuckerberg added. However, according to Zuckerberg, that's easier said than done because no company running a metaverse right now wants to give up control or \"share that ownership.\" \"That's why it's not we're not seeing that kind of consumer mainstream adoption yet because there needs to be a world where you leave the house with one wallet. And you need to see that same behavior online also.\" She added that Web3 needs experts who have been involved in the global banking system and Web2 \u2014 the internet that we know today \u2014 to lend a \"protective layer.\" The need for such experts is all the more important because it has been \"too easy\" for users to be scammed or lose all their assets in Web3, said Zuckerberg. \"There needs to be more protections for consumers \u2026 I think we will wind up [with] web 2.7, where there is some centralization, keeping people safe, but the ability to port your assets with you to any site.\" Another thing that needs to be improved in Web3 is user-friendliness, she added. \"It should not take 45 steps to set up a cryptocurrency wallet, buy a currency and enter the metaverse. It needs to [be] one-stop, beginner-friendly.\" The metaverse may still be in its infancy, but Zuckerberg pointed out that sectors like real estate will be \"extremely valuable.\" \"Wherever there's scarcity \u2026 there's value. I think the big question will just be, is there scarcity in the metaverse and if there is, there will be value in real estate there,\" she added. According to data from MetaMetrics Solutions, real estate sales in the metaverse surpassed $500 million in 2021 and could double in 2022. Zuckerberg said that education and training will be another \"huge area\" for opportunities and revenue. \"Especially in this new age where workers are remote, it is very difficult to upskill remote workers \u2026 I think training in the metaverse, education in an interactive way, is going to become crucial for every business that has a remote work,\" she added. \"We're really just scratching the surface of what we're going to see.\""},

All three countries saw an increase in job postings on LinkedIn for jobs in the accommodation sector, such as hotels, motels, casino hotels and bed-and-breakfast inns. According to data collected by LinkedIn, paid job postings for careers in Australia, India and Singapore increased in June compared to a year ago, with the following sectors seeing the most growth: 1.

Ang noted that the cutback of job postings for Singapore's construction sector was likely due to measures introduced by the government to cool the private and residential property market. Although there's an increase in hiring rates across the three countries, there was less competition among job seekers in June compared to one year ago, LinkedIn data showed. On average, there was a more than a 50% drop in applications for paid job postings on LinkedIn in Australia, India and Singapore \"Even as job postings rise, workers are being more selective in picking their next role, and so competition for jobs on average is down,\" said Ang. \"This means that workers are in a position to demand more out of work, and have higher expectations of what they want in a job \u2013 and that's a healthy sign,\" she added. In both Australia and Singapore, paid job postings that offered remote work options fell. Paid listings in Australia fell by 8% in June compared to a year ago, although sentiment for flexible working arrangements was still strong.

In a recent note, Charles Dumas, chief economist at U.K.-based investment research firm TS Lombard, said that action on climate change is often criticized as moving too slowly. However, with governments increasing spending to aid their post-Covid economies, they may start catching up. A key tenet of this is the ever-decreasing cost of electricity per megawatt hour, according to figures from TS Lombard, with costs of solar, offshore and onshore wind dropping over the last 10 years, while gas and coal have remained largely the same. \"Effectively by 2030 the cost of renewable electricity is going to be half that of coal and gas sourced electricity,\" Dumas told CNBC. These trends will bring many of the various pledges to reach net zero more closely in sight. The fatal floods in Germany in recent weeks have put the impacts of climate change firmly in the spotlight again but they are only the latest in a series of devastating extreme weather events of late, including the sprawling wildfires in Oregon. Amid this backdrop, the United Nations Climate Change Conference, better known as COP26, will meet in Glasgow in November. It will mark one of the most significant multilateral meetings on climate since the Paris agreement. Dumas said that as COP26 approaches, governments need to understand their key priorities, and among them should be infrastructure investments as numerous technological and engineering challenges continue to obstruct renewable energy. \"I think the intermittency problem is pretty serious and it's not just that the sun goes down at night,\" Dumas said. In the case of solar power, output can be mixed depending on the location of infrastructure like solar farms. \"There's huge variation with sunny days in winter and sunny days in the middle of summer so the intermittency takes on a very big seasonal aspect,\" Dumas said. \"You can have vicious weather for a long time in the middle of December or January and lo and behold you wouldn't want to be depending on solar power.\" Energy transmission could be another bottleneck, he said. While the developing world, including several African nations, has great potential in developing sites for generating solar power, that power needs to move easily. \"The issue of transmission technology is really major. If you want Chad to be the new Saudi Arabia, because of the Sahara Desert there's a lot of sun there, but you want the electricity to be used in Europe then you're talking about some expensive processes and processes needing a lot of research and a lot of further investment.\" Storage and carbon capture are all areas that require hefty investment, Dumas added, if governments are to reach their net-zero targets. \"What we need is a very clear public policy lead in order to get anywhere near these net zero promises and I suspect that actually what it's going to be about is a carbon tax, which the Americans may resist but will be necessary,\" he said. Paul Steele, chief economist at an independent policy research institute called the International Institute for Environment and Development, said that climate action and renewable energy investments will serve the dual purpose of tackling the climate crisis while creating jobs for the post-Covid economy. \"One of the priorities coming out of Covid is to create labor intensive employment. Both in developed and developing countries, you can provide labor intensive employment through renewable energy,\" Steele said. One example, he said, was the retrofitting of boilers in homes in the U.K., which would help push the country toward its climate targets and create new jobs while being relatively inexpensive in the grand scheme of things. Steele said that investments to drive a climate-friendly economy cannot be short term or have quick goals. He pointed to the various government support schemes for the airline industry, which has been battered by the pandemic. Just this week, the European courts gave the nod to a $2.9 billion bailout for Air France-KLM's Dutch business. Bailout funds like these should be tied to sustainability commitments by the airline industry, he said, but that can be a dicey proposition to get over the line. \"Governments aren't making the connections enough and traditionally treasuries and particularly the ministries of transport are still dominated by road building lobbies and people who like to build highways and increase transport rather than people who want to invest in sustainable alternatives.\"  "},

He was speaking at the 2022 Global Supertrends Conference. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced in May that the country will take firm steps to restart idled nuclear power plants to stabilize energy supply and prices. In 2011, the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant was hit by a massive earthquake and tsunami, which killed nearly 16,000 people and caused the world's worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986. Though there have been reservations among the Japanese public over the use of nuclear energy, particularly when it comes to the issue of safety, Tanaka said the future of nuclear power is now safer, and stressed the importance of minimizing risk and maintaining \"peaceful use.\" Tanaka attributed the increase in public support to the possibility of \"serious problems by the end of this year\" if Japan does not have nuclear power. He added that Russia supplies 9% of Japan's natural gas, and losing that supply could spell trouble for the country as it would have to turn to alternative sources, which would lead to a spike in energy prices. Japan has repeatedly criticized Russian aggression in Ukraine and has slapped Moscow with economic sanctions. In response, Russia sanctioned over 300 Japanese lawmakers in July. Russia recently cut gas supplies to Europe via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to just a fifth of its capacity. Moscow has repeatedly denied it is weaponizing fossil fuel supplies over the Russia-Ukraine war. Tanaka said that Japan wants to secure energy supplies but also work toward reaching carbon neutrality by 2050, and striking that balance could prove increasingly challenging. Nuclear power has been touted as an important option for decarbonization.\n\"Japan is trying to secure the supply of energy, especially electricity, while trying to maintain the targets of carbon neutral by 2050 intact. So this is really (a) challenge for Japan to do many things,\" he said."},

Here\u2019s what it costs \u2014 and how they pay for it", "tag": "CNBC Travel", "author": "Monica Buchanan Pitrelli", "datetime": "2022-08-22 05:22:04", "paragraphs": " Ernestas Tyminas felt \"stuck\" in his role as a marketing manager at a newspaper in Colorado Springs, Colorado. So he requested two months off to backpack through Asia, he said, landing in Beijing in January 2019. \"On the first day \u2026 I meet this one,\" he said, gesturing to Darina Karpitskaya, sitting by his side. The couple, speaking to CNBC via video from Dubai, said they met via the travel app Couchsurfing, which links solo travelers together. Karpitskaya, 31, and a flight attendant at the time, had been grounded in Beijing for two days because of mechanical problems with her return flight. Though more solo travelers agreed to meet that day, Tyminas and Karpitskaya were the only two who showed up. After one day together, they planned to meet again in Asia one month later. Karpitskaya returned to Asia, and the couple's second date was a \"crazy one-month adventure\" to Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines, said Tyminas, 29. It was in the Philippines, he said, that he decided he wasn't going back to his old life. \"We were \u2026 laying on the beach under the stars,\" he said. \"We were kind of starting to dream about this lifestyle.\" After returning to Colorado, Tyminas quit his job, sold his belongings and moved to Europe, he said. Karpitskaya wasn't quite there yet, saying, \"At first it sounded like: Oh my God, you're quitting your job. You're moving from America. Maybe it's too soon. But at the same time, when I came back from that trip I felt like I'm living a life that I'm not enjoying.\" Tyminas flew from Denver to Paris with his dog \u2014 an 82-pound Borzoi, once known as the \"Russian Wolfhound,\" named Cosmo, who is over 6 feet tall on his hind legs. \"They gave me three rows of seats, and the dog was just laying on the floor,\" he said. From there, the couple traveled often \u2014 to places like Italy and Iceland \u2014 but not yet full time, they said. Then Karpitskaya got what she called her \"dream job\" \u2014 a position with Emirates airline. She moved to Dubai, but the couple continued to meet and travel together. Then Covid hit, and Karpitskaya accepted four months of unpaid leave from her job. \"We said: We have four months \u2014 we can go explore whatever is open,\" said Tyminas. The trio \u2014 including Cosmo, who traveled in a huge bed in the back of their SUV \u2014 traveled first to Croatia, then slowly across much of Europe, including many former Soviet states, said Karpitskaya. She never returned to her job, and couple have been traveling ever since, she said. In the beginning, they spent between $1,000 and $2,000 a month \u2014 all from savings \u2014 by staying in cheap accommodations, cooking at home and seeking out free activities, said Tyminas. As money started to dry up, Tyminas took several online jobs, which netted between $2,000 and $3,000 a month, which wasn't far from his salary of $3,300 in Colorado, he said. But the work was cumbersome, and it \"felt like I still had a job,\" he said. So the couple decided to open a marketing and graphic design company, despite the fact that \"we didn't know a lot,\" said Tyminas. They reached out to thousands of people, they said, often working late into the night. Potential customers would ask, \"Can you design book covers?\" \"Can you promote music?\" Tyminas said his response was always the same, \"Of course I can.\" In reality, he was learning on the job, he said, relying on YouTube, Google and online research. But clients were very happy, he said. \"They paid me half of what they would pay other marketing agencies and the results, they said, were better than they had before,\" said Tyminas. In the first month, the couple made $6,000, he said. Now, sometimes they earn several thousand dollars in a day working with real estate companies and music labels, he added. \"We write blogs for people \u2014 we do everything,\" said Tyminas. Plus \"we don't have to report to anybody. We're our own bosses.\" In the past six months, the couple said they spent an average of $4,000 a month. More than half goes to accommodations, which vary by location \u2014 from $3,100 per month in Dubai to $1,500 in Lisbon, Portugal, they said. They limit stays in expensive locations, like Switzerland, to no more than a week, they said. One way to save money is booking monthlong stays on Airbnb, which cuts down average nightly rates and reduces service and cleaning fees, said Tyminas. But even when they bounced from place to place to visit Europe's Christmas markets last year, they still ended up paying about $2,500 that month, he said. Karpitskaya said she doesn't want these costs to scare people because they spent far less in the beginning. At the time, they spent about 80-100% of their income, but now Tyminas said \"we spend about 30% and \u2026 save the rest.\" The couple told CNBC they still travel modestly \u2014 no five-star hotels \u2014 and they still cook most meals at home. But they spend more on activities that they film for their YouTube channel Dream Team Travels \u2014 another \"completely self-taught\" venture, they said. A life of constant travel isn't all fun and games, they said. They encounter dirty Airbnbs and hosts who cancel reservations at the last minute. They've also had their camera equipment and clothing stolen twice \u2014 once in Mexico, and more recently in France \u2014 plus an attempted theft of their belongings from their car in Barcelona, while they were sitting in it. They have also thought about settling down when they find a place they really love, such as the beaches of Portugal or the French Riviera, said Tyminas. \"But then \u2026 we drive somewhere else and we're like this place is also just as good,\" he said. When Russia invaded Ukraine, quickly occupying the Kherson region where Karpitskaya's parents live, Tyminas emailed CNBC to say that they'd stopped traveling for the time being. \"The first few weeks we didn't even leave our apartment,\" he said. \"We spent a lot of time arranging transportation for civilians as well as many dogs from shelters to be taken out of dangerous regions for adoption in Europe.\" By the summer, they had resumed traveling, but were still helping to evacuate Karpitskaya's family. \"Just a week ago we were able to finally get Darina's parents out of Ukraine,\" said Tyminas, adding that they are currently in his family's home in Lithuania. \"We also did a trip to Romania to pick up Darina's sister and her five-month-old baby from the border and took her to live in Germany.\" The couple are now in Malaysia, they said, and plan to explore Southeast Asia for the next two months."},

The world's biggest long-haul carrier will be retrofitting over 120 aircraft with new interiors, as well as dishing up menus with new vegan options and cinema snacks like popcorn, Emirates said in a statement.\nOther new perks for the carrier's first-class travelers include unlimited portions of Persian caviar, paired with Dom Perignon vintage champagne. Those investments come just as Emirates posted a $1.1 billion loss for the year ended March 31. \"While others respond to industry pressures with cost cuts, Emirates is flying against the grain and investing to deliver ever better experiences to our customers,\" said the president of Emirates airline, Tim Clark. Emirates is not the only airline pulling out all the stops to ride the tailwinds of \"revenge travel\" \u2014 the idea that people are making up for time \"lost\" during the pandemic to travel again. Earlier this year, Finnair launched a new line of premium economy cabins, featuring seats that provide around 50% more space than their economy seats. Air France, likewise, announced new long-haul business seats in May, complete with sliding dividers for passengers who want their own private space.\nEmirates told CNBC that it has seen \"a lot of interest\" in these luxury upgrades, though it said it does not have the full numbers yet. The upgrades come on the heels of an industry report predicting that business travel spending will return to pre-pandemic levels in 2026 rather than 2024, as previously forecast. Though spending by business travelers has been on the upswing, the Global Business Travel Association (GBTA) annual report stated that the 2021 figure was still less than half of the over $1.4 trillion that was generated by in business travel in 2019. One travel analytics company, however, noted a shift in demand toward premium seats. \"During the pandemic, we saw that the numbers of people travelling by air collapsed. However, the proportion of travelers flying in premium cabins increased significantly,\" Olivier Ponti of ForwardKeys told CNBC in an email.\nPonti said that before the pandemic, the split between premium and economy seats was a ratio of 13:87, compared with 17:83 in 2022.\n\"While there's no guarantee that the shift towards premium seats will be maintained as air travel recovers, one can understand why the airlines would want to invest in keeping hold of premium passengers, who, this year have typically spent 575% more on a seat than those flying economy.\" Others are skeptical, however. Edward Russell, an editor at Skift, a travel industry news site, told CNBC it's unclear how much of an effect \"small\" product changes will have on sales. \"Most travelers either fly the airline, or alliance, where they have loyalty, or opt for the cheapest fare. It is only a small subset of travelers who will actually book a flight based on the addition of a sliding door or unlimited caviar.\""},

But booking airfare on a certain day of the week isn't one of them, according to data from Google Flights. Booking mid-week \u2014 and especially Tuesdays around midnight \u2014 is often cited as the best time to purchase flights. But in the past five years, U.S. airfares purchased on Tuesdays, Wednesday or Thursdays have been only 1.9% cheaper on average than airfares purchased during the weekend, according to Google Flights. \"If your trip is just a couple of weeks away, don't wait for Tuesday to roll around \u2014 book your flight now in case the price goes up,\" wrote James Byers, Google Flights' group product manager, on a blog post published yesterday. While the day of the week travelers book may not matter much, the day they fly does, according to Google Flights' research, which examined five years of historical flight data from Aug. 1, 2017 to Aug. 1, 2022. \"On average, flights that depart on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday have been 12% cheaper than weekend departures,\" wrote Byers. \"If you exclude international destinations, the potential savings jump even higher to 20%.\" Another common strategy \u2014 booking early \u2014 also works, according to the data. For U.S. domestic flights, airfares have been lowest between three and eight weeks before a departure date, with prices \"bottoming out\" 44 days out, according to the research. Non-stop flights cost on average about 20% more than connecting flights, according to Google Flights, but flights with stops also increase the risk of interruptions. An Instagram poll by the travel insurance company World Nomads indicated more than 1 in 3 respondents spent up to $250 on flights, meals or hotels because of flight delays or cancellations this summer, while 12% reported spending between $500 to $1,000. Travelers with flexible flying days can use Google Flights' \"date grid\" function to quickly ascertain the cheapest dates to depart and arrive in a given week. Those who want to travel for a specific duration \u2014 say, two weeks \u2014 but are flexible on when, can use the \"price graph\" function to see the cheapest times to fly too. Price tracking also eliminates the need to search again and again to price-check a desired route. Search the route once, hit the button to \"track prices\" and Google Flights will send notifications of airfare changes via email. Based on its historical data, Google Flights also suggests the \"best times\" to book flights for peak-period travel and popular routes. Travelers hoping to save money on airfare to Europe are advised to plan the earliest, while summer vacationers can consider making plans weeks, rather than months, in advance."},

The employees, who spoke with CNBC on the condition of anonymity, said since they have been asked to return to offices, infections notifications pop up in their email inboxes regularly. Employees are reacting with frustration and memes. The company began requiring most employees to return to physical offices at least three days a week in April. Since then, staffers have pushed back on the mandate after they worked efficiently for so long at home while the company enjoyed some of its fastest revenue growth in 15 years. Google has offered full-time employees the option to request permanent remote work, but it's unclear how many workers have been approved. Google\u2019s Covid-19 outbreak in Los Angeles is currently the largest of any employer in LA., according to the city\u2019s public health dashboard. Deadline.com first reported that the tech giant\u2019s trendy Silicon Beach campus in Venice, Calif., recorded 145 infections while 135 cases were recorded at the company\u2019s large Playa Vista campus. A spokesperson for Google told CNBC, \"There has not been a significant increase of onsite COVID-19 transmission on our campuses. The numbers that have been reported in Playa Vista and Venice reflect total cases over the last few months, not current or active cases.\" Staffers have been filling Memegen, an internal company image-sharing site, with memes about the increased number of exposure notifications they're receiving. One meme, which was upvoted 2,840 times, showed a photo of an inbox with the email subject from a San Francisco-based facilities manager stating \u201cWe\u2019re so excited to see you back in the office!\u201d and a subsequent email subject line stating \u201cNotification of Confirmed COVID-19 Case.\u201d Another meme with hundreds of upvotes said \u201cHow it started\u201d with an image of a rainbow arch followed by \u201cHow it\u2019s going\u201d and a wall of text saying \u201cNotification of confirmed Covid-19 case.\u201d Another featured an illustration of a happy Pokemon touring a Bay Area campus next to another photo of a worried Pokemon after getting a Covid-19 notification followed by an alarmed Pokemon with 29 exposure notifications. Another meme shows a picture of Star Wars character Rey, whose caption says \u201cI didn\u2019t know there was this much \u2018Notification of Confirmed COVID-19 Cases\u2019 in the whole galaxy.\u201d Some employees said they received a spike in notifications from the Mountain View, Calif. headquarters and in San Francisco offices after the company held a return-to-office celebration, where Grammy award-winning artist Lizzo performed for thousands of employees at the Shoreline Amphitheater, near Google's main campus. The spokesperson for Google also noted that the company follows methodology laid out by state and local laws in determining the definition of a Covid outbreak, and when to send exposure emails. Last December, Google told employees that they must comply with vaccine policies or they'd face losing pay and then losing their job. Then in February, ahead of asking employees to come back, it relaxed rules around vaccines being a requirement for employment, as well as other rules around testing, social distancing and masks. But it continued to require Covid-19 vaccination to enter physical offices. Now, some Google employees are asking the company to drop the vaccine mandate, arguing Covid-19 outbreaks keep happening anyway in the offices where employees are fully vaccinated. While it still provides a level of protection, the vaccines aren't as strong against the highly transmissible BA.5 variant, the fastest-spreading variant of Covid-19 to date, the group argues in a manifesto called \u201cNo Vaccine Mandate,\" which was posted this month and viewed by CNBC. (The vaccines are still providing good protection against severe disease and death, including with the BA.5 variant, but are not providing substantial protection against infection or mild illness.) The anonymous manifesto says the group, which calls itself Googlers for No Vaccine Mandate, is frustrated that non-vaccinated employees and those who decline to declare their vaccination status are still banned from offices and other gatherings including off-sites, summits and team events. It also claims that some Google employees still haven't met their teams since March 2020 and some were never notified of the vaccination policy during their hiring process. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen waves of Covid-particularly since December 2021 with Omicron and its sub variants spread through Google offices with little regard for vaccination status. We\u2019ve seen many fully vaccinated and boosted colleagues call out sick for multiple days with Covid. We\u2019ve seen both panics and good natured responses to the flood of exposure notifications received by officegoers.\" Other companies that once mandated Covid vaccination requirements have since dropped them, including Boeing, Intel, and United Airlines, citing a federal court\u2019s decision to prohibit enforcement of the federal contractor executive order that required vaccination of large employers that are also government contractors. The group's manifesto says it is hoping Google leadership does the same thing. The group is largely anonymous, although some members' identities are known to CNBC. It claims to include hundreds of employees with tenures of up to 10 years, in roles such as engineering, program management, UX design, education, sales, marketing and finance. It also includes Googlers who are fully vaccinated and \u201cbelieve the company\u2019s vaccine policy is an invasion of privacy and is insensitive to individual circumstances and risk factors.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re writing to ask for your help for a group of Googlers who still aren\u2019t allowed back to our offices,\" the memo states. \u201cWe are reaching out to you as colleagues and peers because our direct appeals to Google leadership have been ignored. When planning an in-person meeting, summit or offsite, think about how Googlers who are barred from full participation by the vaccine policy can be acknowledged and included.\""},

But a new study suggests it may not be worth the time \u2014 at least in some places. The travel insurance comparison site InsureMyTrip compared rates for 950 hotels in 19 global cities on three popular booking websites as well as each hotel's site. According to the results published last week, Hotels.com had the best overall rates \u2014 but just barely. Hotels.com had the best rates in 620 instances, which was slightly higher than Expedia, which had the cheapest rates in 579 instances. Booking directly with a hotel was more expensive, but by only about $6 more on average, according to the study. \"There have been conflicting views on hotel rates, and people ... believe that booking through online travel platforms ensured a better rate than the hotel website,\" said Shalabh Arora, director of marketing at India's Four Seasons Hotel Bengaluru. \"However, it's not so at Four Seasons where rate parity is taken very seriously.\" He said the hotels' website has a pop-up function which compares rates offered by the hotel with those on other booking platforms. Finally, the website Booking.com had the cheapest rates in 72 instances \u2014 or about 7% of the time \u2014 according to the study. \"Not only was [Booking.com] rarely the most affordable, but it was also the most expensive option the majority of the time,\" according to the published results. The company's Managing Director for Asia Pacific Laura Houldsworth responded to the study by email, stating that the company aims \"to always be transparent with our customers\" and that \"our property partners are free to set their own prices on Booking.com.\" She added that \"our promise to price match also means that if a customer should ever find a lower price on another website, Booking.com will refund the difference.\" The report found average hotel rates on Hotels.com and Expedia were the same in seven of 19 cities, with overall averages varying by just 27 cents. \"Expedia and Hotels.com often had the same price, especially with the international hotels,\" said Sarah Webber, director of marketing for InsureMyTrip. Both brands are owned by Expedia Group, which also operates other travel booking websites, including Travelocity, Hotwire, Orbitz and CheapTickets. \"Hotels working with Expedia Group distribute their rates across all of our brands,\" said Anna Brown, a company public relations manager. \"The rate is similar across brands, however various offers ... approved by our hotel partners, sometimes create rate differences.\" Brown said rates can also vary through brands' app-only pricing, while Hotwire's \"Hot Rates\" mask hotels' names prior to purchase in exchange for deep discounts on last-minute bookings. Booking.com is part of Booking Holdings, which operates Priceline, Agoda and Kayak. Booking Holdings had the highest revenue among all online travel agencies from 2019 to 2021, according to the research company Statista. The InsureMyTrip report showed significant rate differences in certain cities. For instance, travelers could save as much as $88 per night in Honolulu, if they found the lowest price. In New York, the report found average hotel rates varied from $293 on Hotels.com to $367 on Booking.com. The study also found: But rate fluctuations were less pronounced outside of the United States. Posted rates varied less than $10 per night on average in Hong Kong, Bangkok, Macau, Kuala Lumpur and Istanbul, according to the research. InsureMyTrip's study represents a snapshot in time, with the research analyzing rates for a double room for two people booked for the night of Aug. 27, 2022, the firm said. All searches were conducted on the same day to avoid price fluctuations, since \"prices can change quickly and without warning,\" said Webber. However, the study did not consider whether rates were refundable or included taxes, said Webber. \"To keep the study as simple as possible, we took the price seen on the sites as the final cost,\" she said. \"So, it's definitely something to consider as not all hotels or booking sites include the same extras in the final price.\" Other factors, such as prepayment requirements and breakfast inclusions, can affect rates too, which further complicates the hotel price comparison process \u2014 for researchers and travelers alike."},

Here are their stories. Job: Emmy-award winning TV host of \" Samantha Brown's Places to Love\"\nStarted in: Comedy \" I went to Syracuse University for musical theater because I so desperately wanted to move to New York City and become a thespian. I wanted to do Shakespeare and be on Broadway. That didn't pan out. I waited on tables for a good eight years. But I loved improv, and I was a part of an improv comedy troupe. So I just kept auditioning for jobs. A writer recommended me to a production company that was \u2026 looking for a host. But my audition for it had to be totally improvised. That's how I got the job. When you are a travel host, there's no script. Yet it is still up to you to define the scene, to understand the trajectory of a story and how to end it. Also in improv, the golden rule is to never say no, it's always yes \u2014 to keep things going. Waiting on tables in New York City for eight years, you start to be really humbled, [but] those were the tools that I had that got me a job that I never in my wildest dreams thought I would ever have.\" Job: Creator of \" Strictly Dumpling\" and other YouTube channels (total: about 8 million subscribers)\nStarted in: Accounting and wedding videography \"I moved to the U.S. from China when I was 8 years old. My parents started working in restaurants, and eventually started their own very Americanized Chinese restaurant. So I grew up on a steady diet of General Tso's chicken and crab rangoon. There wasn't a lot of diversity where I'm from, but it helped that my parents sent me back to China when I was 13. Most people get grounded and sent to their room as a punishment \u2014 I got sent to China for two years. That's when I was like: Wow, it's so amazing \u2014 the people, the history \u2014 I want to know more. After college, I went to New York and worked on Wall Street for a year. Then I became a wedding videographer because I wanted to be flexible. I was living in a small basement apartment in Brooklyn with no air conditioning, making about $400 \u2014 on a good week. But this was the first time I was eating something that wasn't Red Lobster and Olive Garden. I got a taste of diverse ethnic food in Chinatown, and I started to discover a lot of my heritage that I never really saw as important before. I started recording food videos on YouTube as a food diary for myself. I remember having a conversation with a friend that food content will never amount to anything. There wasn't anybody online doing it. I had like 10 subscribers. Somehow it grew to this, which was never expected. I never really had much money growing up \u2014 or throughout most of my adulthood. So I was always looking for things that were inexpensive but also really filling and delicious. And that's pretty much what I do around the world now.\" Job: Television host of \" Family Travel with Colleen Kelly\"\nStarted in: Sales \"I tried out for the broadcast school at the University of Texas. The school gave you one chance to be accepted into the program. I had never sat at an anchor desk with a camera pointed at me. I failed miserably. Several years later, I graduated and got my first job in sales, eventually moving to Chicago and working in the pharmaceutical industry. The money was amazing, and I had a company car. But I wasn't living my dream, and this started to really bother me. In my early 30s, I got married and eventually quit my job to be a stay-at-home mom. One day, when my two little girls were in school, I went to our town hall's cable TV station and asked if, in exchange for teaching me how to edit, I could host the local entertainment show about our village \u2014 something like \"Access Hollywood\" for our 50,000-resident town. Because they had no other offers, they said yes. I acted confident, but I was as green as they come. I was shaking in my boots every time I did an interview and read voice-over, but I was gaining experience and knowledge. I confided in another mom that my dream was to host a national travel show, and, surprisingly, she agreed to produce it with me. We wrote a script, found a local camera guy for a few dollars and made a pilot. I took meetings with two major companies \u2014 both said no. I was told by one network that women don't watch travel shows, so the concept of family travel didn't appeal to them. I then sent thousands of emails to television stations. Nothing worked. Finally, my mother suggested I call the local PBS station. I googled the head of programming, called him (no emails) and got a meeting. After more meetings, we learned PBS was picking two shows to go national, and \"Family Travel with Colleen Kelly\" was one of them. We scraped by for a year, producing 13 episodes that first season. Now, the show has been on for more than 10 years. And, the best part is that I can bring my family with me.

It is the first time the FDA has authorized an updated vaccine formula since the original shots rolled out in December 2020. Pharmacies are expected to start administering the new boosters after Labor Day weekend. The U.S. has secured 171 million doses of Pfizer's and Moderna's updated shots so far, according to the Health and Human Services Department. Pfizer's new booster dose is authorized for people ages 12 and older, while Moderna's new shots are authorized for adults ages 18 and older. The eligible age groups can receive the boosters two months after completing their primary series or their most recent booster with the old shots. The U.S. will no longer use the original vaccines as booster doses for individuals ages 12 and older now that the the updated shots have been authorized, according to the FDA. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has to sign off on the boosters before pharmacies can give them to patients. The CDC's independent advisory committee is scheduled to meet Thursday and Friday to review the data and issue its recommendations for health-care providers. Public health officials believe the redesigned boosters will provide longer-lasting protection against the virus and reduce hospitalizations this fall and winter. The new boosters target both the original strain that emerged in China more than two years ago, which scientists refer to as the \"wild type,\" and omicron BA.4 and BA.5, which are now the dominant variants in the U.S. Shots that target two different strains are called bivalent vaccines. The vaccine makers developed the original shots against the strain of Covid that first emerged in Wuhan, China, in 2019. But the virus has mutated dramatically since then. Omicron and its subvariants have drifted so much from the original Covid strain that the virus is able to slip past the protective antibodies induced by the vaccines. As a consequence, the shots' effectiveness at preventing infection and mild illness has declined substantially as the virus has evolved. Though the vaccines are still generally preventing severe disease, the protection they provide against hospitalization has slipped over time as well. \"There is declining effectiveness against hospitalization and severe illness. The problem has been persuading the American people to get boosted on a regular basis,\" said Dr. Peter Hotez, an infectious disease expert at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas. Hotez led a team that developed a Covid vaccine based on protein technology that is authorized in India. About 76% of people ages 12 and older have received their first two vaccine doses in the U.S., according to CDC data. About 50% of those individuals have received their first booster dose. For adults ages 18 and older, three doses of Pfizer's or Moderna's original vaccines were 55% effective at preventing hospitalization from the omicron BA.2 subvariant four months after the third shot, according to CDC data. Three shots were 19% effective at preventing infection from omicron five months after the third shot, according to CDC data from August 2021 through May 2022. The rapidly spreading BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants have since driven omicron BA.2 out of circulation. Dr. Peter Marks, head of the FDA office responsible for reviewing vaccines, said the hope is that the updated boosters will restore the high level of protection against disease that vaccines demonstrated when they were first authorized in December 2020. \"We don't know for a fact yet whether we will get to that same level, but that is the goal here. And that is what we believe the evidence that we've seen helps point to,\" Marks told reporters during a news conference after the authorization Wednesday. The Biden administration moved rapidly over the summer to get updated shots ready for the fall. Public health officials are worried the U.S. is on the verge of another wave of infection as more transmissible omicron variants spread, immunity from the original vaccines wears off, and people head indoors to escape colder weather. Pfizer and Moderna were originally developing boosters to target omicron BA.1, the variant that caused the massive wave of infection last winter. But the FDA told the vaccine makers in late June to switch gears and target BA.4 and BA.5 instead as those variants quickly gained ground. The sudden change in plans left little time for clinical trials in humans before a fall rollout. As a consequence, the authorization is based on human clinical trials from the BA.1 shots, which produced a better immune response than the original doses, according to the FDA. But it's unclear how the BA.5 boosters will perform in humans since the data is based on BA.1. Marks said it will likely be at least another two months before human clinical data on the BA.5 shots is made available to the public. The most common side effects from the human trials of the BA.1 shots was pain, redness, swelling at the injection site, fatigue, headaches, muscle pain, joint pain, chills, nausea, vomiting and fever, according to the FDA. The Covid vaccines also have a well-established safety profile after administration to millions of people over the course of the pandemic, the FDA said. In addition to human data from the BA.1 shots, the authorization was also based on animal studies from the BA.5 boosters, Marks said. In June, Pfizer also presented data to the FDA's independent vaccine advisory committee that showed the bivalent omicron BA.5 shots increased antibodies in mice that protect against infection by about 2.6-fold compared with the original vaccine. Marks said the FDA used the same process for the authorization that it relied on in the past for switching the strains in flu vaccines. \"We're pretty confident that or what we have is very similar to the situation that we've done in the past with influenza changes where we don't do clinical studies for them in the United States,\" Marks said. \"We know from the way the vaccine works, and from the data that we have, that we can predict how well the vaccine will be working.\" But some infectious disease and vaccine experts say the FDA should have waited for human data from the BA.5 shots before authorizing them. Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the FDA's advisory committee, said data based on mice studies is not sufficient to justify authorizing the new boosters. \"You have to show some evidence in people that the immune response that you're getting with the bivalent vaccine is clearly better, and those data haven't been presented,\" said Offit, an infectious disease and vaccine expert at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. \"You can't ask millions of people to get this booster dose without showing some human data that you have a dramatic increase in neutralizing antibodies to the BA.4/BA.5 strains as compared to boosting with the ancestral type,\" Offit said, referring to the currently authorized shots based on the version of Covid that emerged in China, more than two years ago. Michael Osterholm, a leading epidemiologist and director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, also said more data needs to be presented on how the BA.5 shots perform in humans. \"It's not that I don't think it could work,\" Osterholm said. \"But I think we need the data first to show that the immune response to this vaccine is equivalent to or better than what we have already.\" But CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky, in a radio interview, said waiting longer for human data from the BA.5 shots could mean the boosters become outdated if a new variant emerges. Walensky said the change in the vaccine formula is small and should not affect safety. \"There's always a question here of being too slow versus too fast,\" Walensky told \"Conversations on Health Care\" in a radio interview. \"One of the challenges is if we wait for those data to emerge in human data [...] we will be using what I would consider to be a potentially outdated vaccine.\""},

Although monkeypox cases are still increasing nationally, the speed of the outbreak appears to be slowing, Walensky said. The U.S. has reported nearly 17,000 monkeypox cases since May, more than any other country in the world, according to CDC data. In New York City, which has reported more infections than any other jurisdiction, new monkeypox cases have dropped from more than 70 per day on average to nine as of Thursday, according to data from the city health department. Dr. Aswhin Vasan, the city health commissioner, said earlier this week the outbreak has slowed due to increased vaccination and community outreach efforts. New York City has reported a total of 2,888 monkeypox cases. In Chicago, another major epicenter of the outbreak, new cases have dropped from 141 during the week ended July 30 to 74 for the week ended Aug. 20, according to that city's health department. Chicago has reported a total of 807 cases. \"We're not seeing the potentially exponential growth that we were seeing early on so that is reassuring,\" said Dr. Allison Arwady, Chicago's public health commissioner, during a Facebook live event earlier this week. \"Too early to say things look really good, but definitely some signs of slowing of cases.\" The U.S. is nearing the point where the entire community of gay and bisexual men who currently face the greatest health risk from monkeypox rwill have access to two doses of the monkeypox vaccine, according to Dawn O'Connell, head of the office responsible for the national stockpile at the Health and Human Services Department. The CDC previously estimated that up to 1.7 million gay and bisexual men who are HIV-positive or are eligible for medicine to reduce their chance of contracting HIV face the greatest health risk from monkeypox. The U.S. has distributed 1.5 million doses of the monkeypox vaccine so far and more than 3 million doses should be available by when the latest distribution round is complete, according to O'Connell. To date, the outbreak is disproportionately affecting Black and Hispanic men. About 30% of monkeypox patients are white, 32% are Hispanic and 33% are Black, according to CDC data. Whites make up about 59% of the U.S. population while Hispanics and Blacks account for 19% and 13%, respectively. The monkeypox vaccine, called Jynneos in the U.S., is administered in two doses 28 days apart. The patients will not have full protection from the vaccine until two weeks after the second dose is administered, according to the CDC. Data from 19 jurisdictions show that nearly 97% of the shots administered so far were first doses, according to Walensky. About 94% of monkeypox cases are associated with sexual contact and nearly all of the people who have contracted the virus are men who have sex with men, according to Demetre Daskalakis, the deputy head of the White House monkeypox response team. A CDC survey of 824 gay and bisexual men found that 48% respondents have reduced their number of sexual partners and 50% have reduced one-time sexual encounters during the current outbreak. A separate CDC study found that a 40% decrease in one-time sexual encounters would reduce the final percentage of gay and bisexual men infected with monkeypox by up to 31%. \"We're actually seeing vaccine get out, behaviors change, harm-reduction messages being heard and implemented,\" Walensky said. \"And all of that working together to bend the curve.\" Correction: 33% of confirmed monkeypox cases are among Black Americans. A previous version of this story misstated the figure."},

The agency's independent committee on vaccines voted 13 to 1 earlier Thursday in favor of the shots after reviewing the available safety and effectiveness data over an almost seven-hour-long meeting. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky signed off on the shots a few hours later, clearing the way for pharmacies to soon start administering the shots. Pfizer 's omicron boosters were OKed for people ages 12 and older, while Moderna 's updated shots were authorized for people ages 18 and older. The eligible age groups can receive the boosters at least two months after completing their primary series or their most recent booster with the old shots. Walensky said her decision followed \"a comprehensive scientific evaluation and robust scientific discussion.\" \"If you are eligible, there is no bad time to get your Covid-19 booster and I strongly encourage you to receive it,\" she said in a statement. Pfizer plans to ask the Food and Drug Administration to also authorize the new boosters for children ages 5 to 11 years old in early October, company executives told the committee Thursday. The original vaccines will no longer be used as a booster in people ages 12 and older now that the reformulated shots are coming online. Public health officials are expecting another wave of Covd infection this fall as immunity from the old vaccines wanes off, more contagious omicron subvariants spread, and people spend more time indoors as the weather turns colder and families gather for the holidays. The CDC and the FDA hope the new boosters will provide more durable protection against infection, mild illness and severe disease. The reformulated shots target omicron BA.5, the dominant variant of Covid as well as the strain that emerged in China more than two years ago. The U.S so far has secured 171 million doses of Pfizer's and Moderna's new boosters. More than 200 million people are eligible for the shots, according to the CDC. Dr. Sara Oliver, a CDC official, told the committee Thursday that there should be enough supply of the vaccine to meet demand this fall. There is no data from human trials on the new BA.5 boosters, so it's unclear how they will perform in the real world. The CDC and FDA used human data from clinical trials for shots targeting the original version of omicron, BA.1, which triggered a stronger immune response than the old vaccines. Pfizer and Moderna were originally developing omicron boosters to target BA.1, but the FDA asked the companies to switch gears in June and develop BA.5 shots instead after the subvariant became dominant. The decision to focus on BA.5 did not leave enough time to wait for data from human trials ahead of a fall vaccine rollout. The lack of human data for the BA.5 shots has caused some controversy, but Dr. Peter Marks, a senior FDA official, said the agency followed the same process used for years with strain changes for flu vaccines. Marks said on Wednesday that flu vaccine strains are also changed without human clinical data. Dr. Pablo Sanchez, the only committee member who voted against the shots, called the recommendation premature and said the U.S. should have waited for human data before proceeding with the boosters. \"There's a lot of vaccine hesitancy already \u2014 we need the human data,\" said Sanchez, a professor of pediatrics at Ohio State University. But Sanchez said he believes the new boosters are safe and he will likely receive one himself. Panel member Dr. Oliver Brooks, chief medical officer at Watts HealthCare Corporation in Los Angeles, questioned why the FDA decided to go with a BA.5 vaccine when clinical data is available for the BA.1 shots that the vaccine makers were originally developing. Brooks ended up voting in favor the shots. But Dr. Sarah Long, also a committee member, said there's no reason to expect the BA.5 boosters will be inferior to the old shots since they also include the original Covid strain, and they have potential to reduce hospitalizations and deaths heading into the fall and winter. Long also voted in favor. Officials at the FDA and CDC have said the omicron BA.1 and omicron BA.5 boosters are similar enough that the immune response data from the BA.1 shot should give a good indication of how the BA.5 shots will perform. Omicron BA.1 and BA.5 are closely related with a four-mutation difference, according to Dr. Jacqueline Miller, who works on vaccine development at Moderna. Moderna completed enrollment in clinical trials on the BA.5 shots last week and should have results by the end of the year, Miller told the CDC committee on Thursday. Pfizer's clinical trial is also ongoing, though company hasn't said when it expects results. The health agencies also reviewed data on the BA.5 shots from mouse studies. Moderna presented data showing that the BA.5 shots increased antibodies in mice more than fourfold compared with the old shots. The mice express the same cell protein as humans that the virus latches onto. Pfizer's BA.5 booster increased antibodies 2.6 fold in mice compared with the original vaccine. The most common side effects from the human trials of the BA.1 shots was pain, redness, swelling at the injection site, fatigue, headaches, muscle pain, joint pain, chills, nausea, vomiting and fever, according to the FDA. Oliver, the CDC official, told the committee that health officials do not expect any difference in the safety profile of the BA.1 and BA.5 shots given that subvariants differ only by a few mutations. But Oliver noted that the risk of myocarditis following a BA.5 booster shot is unknown. There is an elevated risk of myocarditis among young men and adolescent boys following the second dose of Pfizer's and Moderna's shots but the risk of myocarditis from Covid infection is higher, according to the CDC. \"We know that the myocarditis risk is unknown but anticipate a similar risk to that seen after the monovalent vaccines,\" Oliver said. The monovalent vaccines are the old shots that have been administered to millions of people in the U.S. over the past two years. The original vaccines, which were first authorized in December 2020, are no longer providing meaningful protection against infection because the virus has mutated so much over the past two years. The shots were developed against the first strain that emerged in China, so they are no longer matched to target the omicron subvariants that are spreading. Infections, hospitalizations and deaths have declined dramatically since the massive wave of omicron infection last winter, but have plateaued this summer at a stubbornly high level. Omicron BA.5 is the most contagious and immune evasive variant yet, and breakthrough infections have become increasingly common as a consequence. The old vaccines effectiveness against hospitalization also declined after omicron BA.5 became dominant. A third dose was 77% effective at prevention hospitalization four months after receiving the shot, but protection declined after 120 day to as low as 34%, according to CDC data. A fourth dose in people ages 50 and older was 56% effective at preventing hospitalization after four months. Deaths and hospitalizations from Covid among people ages 65 and older have increased since April, according to Heather Scobie, a CDC epidemiologist who presented data during Thursday's meeting. Deaths have risen in particular among people ages 75 and older, Scobie said. The CDC has shifted to a more targeted public health response with an emphasis on protecting the most vulnerable \u2014 the elderly, people with serious medical conditions and those who have weak immune systems. Although there's no data on the real-world effectiveness of the new boosters, the U.S. is moving rapidly to roll them out in the hope that they will protect people this fall."},

Over the past two years, fall and winter have brought devastating Covid surges that took hundreds of thousands of lives and pushed hospitals to the breaking point. But U.S. health officials say the nation is in a much different place today due to the arsenal of tools doctors now have to fight the virus. \"We are in a much, much better place. We are in a better place because people have gotten vaccinated and boosted. We've got treatments that are widely available,\" Dr. Ashish Jha, White House Covid response coordinator, said in an August interview with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in a report published in early August, said high levels of immunity in the U.S. population from vaccination and infection have substantially reduced the threat of hospitalization and death from Covid. The CDC ended its quarantine recommendations for people exposed to the virus last month. Public health officials are calling on people to stay up to date on their vaccines, but are largely leaving it up to individuals to decide what other precautions they should take based on their health history, risk tolerance and how much Covid is spreading in their communities. The CDC is taking a more targeted approach that focuses on making sure those at the highest risk of severe illness have access to vaccines, antiviral treatments and other therapeutics to protect their health. Many people haven't had a vaccine dose in months, which means their immune protection against the virus is waning off with some studies showing three shots of the original vaccines were just 19% effective at preventing Covid infection after five months. At the same time, more transmissible omicron subvariants are spreading. It's creating a perfect storm ahead of the cold weather months and holidays that force people indoors in close proximity to each other and a highly contagious airborne pathogen. Even with all the tools the U.S. has available, Covid infections, hospitalizations and deaths have plateaued at stubbornly high levels over the summer. The U.S. is gearing up for a booster campaign after Labor Day with reformulated vaccines that target both the original strain of the virus that emerged in Wuhan, China, in 2019 and omicron BA.5, the dominant variant in circulation. Public health officials believe the reformulated boosters will provide more durable protection against infection and help avert a major surge that taxes hospitals. \"It's going to be really, really important for people to get this updated, new, very specific Covid vaccine because I think it's going to help a lot in preventing infections, and I think it is going to help a lot in keeping people out of the hospital,\" Jha said. The U.S. has so far secured 171 million doses of Pfizer's and Moderna's new boosters shots that target omicron. The reformulated boosters could reduce infections by 2.4 million, hospitalizations by 137,000 and deaths by 9,700 from August through May of 2023 if a new variant doesn't emerge, according to a projection by a team of scientists who forecast the trajectory of the pandemic, called the Covid-19 Scenario Modeling Hub. But the projection is based on optimistic assumptions about booster coverage and efficacy, according to the scientists. The model assumes that the shots will prove 80% effective at preventing illness, the vaccination campaign will ramp up quickly and the public will broadly embrace the new boosters. But many people in the U.S. still haven't gotten their first booster with the old vaccine yet, and it's not clear that these individuals will be more willing to take the new shots. About 76% of people ages 12 and older have received their first two vaccine doses, according to CDC data. Out of those people, about half have gotten their third shot. It's also not clear how effective the new omicron boosters will be in the real world yet. The Food and Drug Administration authorized the shots on Wednesday without results from human trials on the BA.5 shots. But Dr. Peter Marks, head of the FDA office responsible for reviewing vaccines, said the available data suggests the shots will provide substantially better protection. Public health officials are working under the assumption that the U.S. will face some version of omicron in the fall, which is why the new vaccines target BA.5. But there is always the risk that a new variant outside the omicron lineage will emerge that can evade the new shots. If Covid mutates in a way that gives life to a new, dominant variant and boosters are slow to get out to the public, the U.S. could suffer 1.3 million hospitalizations and 181,000 deaths over the next nine months, according to the scientists' most pessimistic scenario. But Michael Osterholm, director of Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said the reality is that nobody really knows what will happen in the fall. \"We don't know,\" he said. Ali Mokdad, an epidemiologist at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, said his group is predicting a rise in Covid cases, deaths and hospitalizations this fall. \"But the rise in mortality and hospitalization will not be similar to what we have seen before, simply because most people have some kind of immunity against illness,\" Mokdad said. About 95% of people ages 16 and older in the U.S., in fact, have Covid antibodies of some sort \u2014 either from vaccination or prior infection, according to a CDC survey of blood donor data. This means more people in the U.S. have at least some protection against severe disease and death from Covid than at any other point in the pandemic. Previous infection, vaccination alone and vaccination plus infection didn't necessarily keep people from getting sick, but they all showed more than 70% effectiveness against developing a really severe case or dying from omicron BA.2 , according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine by Weill Cornell Medicine in Qatar. The study examined the medical records of 100,000 individuals in Qatar from December 2021 through February 2022. But the Qatar study may not translate well to the U.S. population, which has a large elderly population and many people with preexisting medical conditions, like obesity or diabetes. Qatar on the other hand has a very young population \u2014 only 9% of its residents are age 50 or older compared with more than a third of all Americans. Omicron has also continued to evolve into more transmissible and immune-evasive subvariants. The BA.5 subvariant became dominant this summer, pushing out BA.2. Though BA.5 has not been associated with more severe disease, it is more effective at evading immunity and infecting people who are vaccinated or who have recovered from Covid. \"BA.5 is the most contagious, certainly the most immune evasive variant we've seen,\" Jha told NBC News in July. \"That means if you were infected earlier this you're still at very high risk of reinfection. It means if you've not been vaccinated recently you have a very high risk of having a breakthrough.\" While the CDC previously thought that infection provided about 90 days of protection, Jha told reporters in July that breakthrough infections have become more common and are happening earlier with BA.5. He said it's unclear how long immunity lasts after recovering from a BA.5 infection. Osterholm said the pandemic has entered another unprecedented period. Previously, infections have surged to high peaks and then steeply declined before the next wave. But for the past three months, infections, hospitalizations and deaths have plateaued at a high level with no sign of another variant displacing BA.5, he said. \"We're seeing now more and more people are on their second and third episodes of this,\" Osterholm said. \"What is the interaction between increasing vaccination, natural infection and immunity related to infection? We just don't know,\" he said. It's unclear whether the current pattern of transmission will continue or if the U.S. will face another wave, Osterholm said. Right now, the U.S. is averaging more than 88,000 new infections daily, which is likely a vast undercount because people testing positive at home isn't picked up by the official data. More than 32,000 people total are hospitalized across the U.S. with Covid right now, and an average of nearly 400 people are still dying every day from the virus, according to data from the CDC and the Health and Human Services Department. That's a significant improvement from the peak of the outbreak in the winter of 2021 when more than 3,000 people died a day on average. Though milder today than those early days of the pandemic, Covid is still killing at four or five times the fatality rate of the flu, Jha told the Chamber. \"If everybody was up to date on their vaccines and people got treated with Paxlovid as they're supposed to deaths would go to close to zero across America,\" Jha said. Hospitalizations are down 75% and deaths are down 85% from the peak of last winter's omicron surge. But if deaths remain at their current level through next year, more than 140,000 people would succumb to the virus, which would still make Covid one of the 10 leading causes of death in the U.S. \"Will we continue to see this kind of activity maintained for some time? People will say it can't go on endlessly because people will be infected and develop immunity. But what happens with waning immunity?\" Osterholm said. Many elderly people and individuals with weak immune systems remain vulnerable to the virus. The rate of hospitalization and death from Covid has increased among those ages 65 and older since April despite high levels of vaccination in this age group, according to CDC data. Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at the Brown University School of Public Health, said she is worried about the elderly and those with weak immune systems who are not up to date on their vaccines heading into the fall. Nuzzo said the public health response this fall should be laser focused on making sure these people are protected. \"I have some worry that unless we put that at the top of our list, our efforts are just going to be diluted, spread out over a number of different areas,\" Nuzzo said. \"If we fail to make sure the highest-risk people are fully protected, that's when we're going to see the deaths and that's the most important thing we could try to prevent.\" Although 92% of those ages 65 and older received the first two doses of the vaccine, many of them have not stayed up to date with their boosters. About 70% received their third dose and only 40% have gotten their fourth shot since the FDA authorized it in February. People ages 50 and older who received a second booster dose were 14 times less likely to die from Covid than the unvaccinated, and three times less likely to die than people who had one booster dose, according to CDC data. Dr. Paul Offit, an infectious disease expert at Children's Hospital Philadelphia, said people ages 75 and older, people with serious medical conditions and those with compromised immune systems would benefit the most from getting a booster right now. Deaths from Covid have risen in particular among people ages 75 and older, according to the CDC. The CDC has also emphasized the importance of using therapeutics to protect people who simply cannot mount a strong immune response to the virus even with vaccination. Nearly 3% of U.S. adults have compromised immune systems, or about 7 million people ages 18 or older, according a survey published in 2016 in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The CDC has emphasized the importance of administering an investigational antibody therapy called Evusheld for people ages 12 and older with moderate and severely compromised immune systems. Evusheld is administered as two injections, before Covid infection, every six months to prevent severe illness, according to the FDA. But only 450,000 courses of the medicine have been administered so far, according to the Health and Human Services Department. \"The goal moving forward here for this year, next year, five years and 10 years down the road is protecting the vulnerable,\" Offit said."},

Explaining its decision, the company \u2014 one of several in England and Wales to have announced water usage limits in recent weeks \u2014 said extreme temperatures and this summer's heatwave had resulted in the highest demand for water in more than 25 years. \"The driest July since 1885, the hottest temperatures on record, and the River Thames reaching its lowest level since 2005 have led to a drop in reservoir levels in the Thames Valley and London,\" it said. The TUB does not apply to businesses, although Thames Water said it was asking those within its area \"to be mindful of the drought and to use water wisely.\" This could involve companies switching off water features on their premises and not washing their vehicles, it suggested. \"Implementing a Temporary Use Ban for our customers has been a very difficult decision to make and one which we have not taken lightly,\" Sarah Bentley, the Thames Water CEO, said. \"After months of below average rainfall and the recent extreme temperatures in July and August, water resources in our region are depleted,\" Bentley added. The announcement of the ban comes at a time when many water companies are facing criticism related to leaks from their pipes. For its part, Thames Water said it had teams focused on locating and fixing more than 1,100 leaks per week. When it comes to enforcement of the ban, the firm said it hoped and expected customers to continue using water wisely. \"If we become aware of customers ignoring the restrictions, we'll contact them to make sure they're aware of the rules and how to use water responsibly and wisely,\" it added. \"There are criminal offences for those that repeatedly ignore requests to comply with the ban.\" Last month saw temperatures in the U.K. surge, with highs of over 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) recorded for the first time ever. On Aug. 12, the U.K.'s Environment Agency announced that parts of England had moved into drought status. \"In drought affected areas the public and businesses should be very mindful of the pressures on water resources and should use water wisely,\" authorities said. They added that government expected water firms \"to act to reduce leakage and fix leaking pipes as quickly as possible and take wider action alongside government policy.\" The U.K. is not alone when it comes to drought-related issues. On July 18, the European Commission's Joint Research Centre published a report looking at drought in Europe. \"The severe drought affecting several regions of Europe since the beginning of the year continues expanding and worsening,\" it said. \"Dry conditions are related to a wide and persistent lack of precipitation combined with early heatwaves in May and June.\" In an interview with CNBC earlier this week, Bill Hare, CEO and senior scientist at research non-profit Climate Analytics, explained how the current conditions were having wide-ranging effects. \"On the water supply, it's clear that in the U.K. and other parts of Europe, we're seeing already very significant water stress that's beginning to affect \u2026 ordinary urban residents, not just farmers,\" he said. \"We're seeing the lack of availability for cooling water for thermal, nuclear or coal power stations, which is causing curtailment of power,\" Hare, who was speaking to CNBC's Joumanna Bercetche, said. \"This is a problem we're seeing all over the world,\" he added. \"We're seeing, also, issues for example in Germany, now in the Danube region, with low water flow, meaning you can't carry cargo anymore.\" This was in turn, \"having big implications not just for the transport of energy, but for agriculture, all manner of industrial commodities and so on.\""},

The economy saw growth in all the key sectors and subsectors in August, led by a gain of 68,000 jobs in professional and business services. \"The market will like the broad-based gains in jobs as both goods-producing and services jobs rose in August,\" said Jeffrey Roach, the chief economist for LPL Financial. The strongest areas within professional and business services include computer systems design, management and technical consulting, and architectural and engineering. The sector has now added 1.1 million jobs over the past 12 months, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Health care came in second for the month, with 48,200 jobs added. If health-care jobs were added to education and social services, as some economists do, that broad sector would have matched the 68,000 gain by professional and business services. Retail trade was another bright spot, growing by 44,000 jobs. That was an acceleration from the 29,100 jobs added in July. Even though job growth was positive across the board, it was significantly slower in some areas. Leisure and hospitality, for example, added 31,000 jobs in August after growing by 95,000 in July. The sector is still 1.2 million short of its pre-pandemic level. Transportation and warehousing added just 4,800 jobs after growing by more than 24,000 in July. Roach also pointed to a rise in part-time workers by 225,000, with 69,000 saying they could not find full-time employment, as a potential area of concern going forward."},

Toyota Battery Manufacturing North Carolina is set to start operations in 2025, with the firm stating that total investment in the plant will now amount to $3.8 billion. Norm Bafunno, who is senior vice president, unit manufacturing and engineering at Toyota Motor North America, said the announcement marked \"another significant milestone\" for the business. The additional investment in the U.S. is part of a wider investment of up to $5.6 billion in battery production, with Toyota noting that demand for battery electric vehicles was growing. To this end, the business said it would aim to ramp up \"combined battery production capacity\" in the U.S. and Japan by as much as 40 gigawatt hours. As well as diesel and gasoline vehicles, Toyota is known for its hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell offerings. It is also attempting to make headway in the increasingly competitive battery-electric market, where firms like Tesla and Volkswagen are jostling for position. This has not been without its challenges. In June 2022, Toyota issued a safety recall for more than 2,000 of its all-electric SUV, the bZ4X. Toyota may be looking to invest billions in EV battery production, but on Wednesday the business stressed it would also \"continue to make every effort to flexibly meet the needs\" of customers \"in all countries and regions by offering multiple powertrains and providing as many options as possible.\" Indeed, the website of Toyota Europe states that the \"internal combustion engine continues to be the most popular means of powering vehicles and it will continue to play a role for the next 20 to 30 years.\" All the above comes at a time when major economies are laying out plans to reduce the environmental footprint of road-based transportation. Just this month, the California Air Resources Board approved a rule that will require all new car sales in the state to be zero emission by the year 2035. Elsewhere, the U.K. wants to stop the sale of new diesel and gasoline cars and vans by 2030. It will require, from 2035, all new cars and vans to have zero-tailpipe emissions. The European Union \u2014 which the U.K. left on Jan. 31, 2020 \u2014 is pursuing similar targets. According to the International Energy Agency, electric vehicle sales hit 6.6 million in 2021. In the first quarter of 2022, EV sales came to 2 million, a 75% increase compared to the first three months of 2021."},

Situated roughly 89 kilometers (approximately 55 miles) off the coast of Yorkshire, England, the scale of Hornsea 2 is considerable. According to Orsted, it has a capacity of more than 1.3 gigawatts and stretches across an area of 462 square kilometers \u2014 more than half the size of New York City. Hornsea 2, it added, uses Siemens Gamesa turbines with blades measuring 81 meters, or more than 265 feet. \"One revolution of the wind turbine blades can power an average UK home for 24 hours,\" the company says. It is the latest step forward for the Hornsea 2 project, which generated its first power in Dec. 2021. The development comes as European countries attempt to wean themselves off Russian fossil fuels, including gas, following the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine in February. \"Current global events highlight more than ever the importance of landmark renewable energy projects like Hornsea 2, helping the UK increase the security and resilience of its energy supply and drive down costs for consumers by reducing dependence on expensive fossil fuels,\" said Duncan Clark, head of the U.K. region at Orsted. The U.K. is home to a mature offshore wind sector that looks set to expand in the coming years, with authorities aiming for up to 50 GW of capacity by 2030. The European Union, which the U.K. left in January 2020, has previously laid out a 300 GW target for offshore wind by the middle of this century. Across the Atlantic, the U.S. has a long way to go to catch up with Europe. America's first offshore wind facility, the 30 megawatt Block Island Wind Farm, only started commercial operations in late 2016.

Meanwhile, Black workers marked the only demographic to see their labor force participation fall. The unemployment rate rose 0.2 percentage point to 3.7% in August, according to data released Friday by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Nonfarm payrolls came in at 315,000 and fell in line with estimates of 318,000. While all demographic groups saw the unemployment rate tick up slightly, it rose at a sharper pace for both Hispanic and Black workers to 4.5% and 6.4%, respectively, from 3.9% and 6% in July. However, Black workers marked the only group that saw labor force participation decline, while the group's employment-population ratio, which measures what percentage of the population holds a job, also fell. \"There is some volatility in these numbers but seeing a downward trend in employment and participation is worrisome,\" said Elise Gould, senior economist with the Economic Policy Institute. For August, Black labor force participation fell to 61.8% from 62% in July, while the employment to population ratio dipped to 57.9% from 58.3% William Spriggs, chief economist to the AFL-CIO, said that looking at Black workers is one way to gauge and understand what's really happening among employers. Black workers across the board face more discrimination than many other groups, which could be one explanation, he said. A potential slowdown in hiring \u2014 as evident through this week's ADP private payrolls data \u2014 could also be a contributor to these results. \"When firms slow their hiring rate, that hit Black workers immediately because they're already in line the longest to try and find a job,\" Spriggs said. \"What's happened is the queue's just gotten longer so the discouraged worker effect is much more acute for Black workers. While it's too early to assign a specific cause to the declining labor force participation among Black workers, Gould said the continued downward trend in recent months may signal something other than \"a statistical anomaly.\" That said, the Federal Reserve's campaign to quickly raise rates to tame surging prices may be causing more damage to the labor market, which tends to appear among historically disadvantaged groups like Black workers. \"Black workers are beginning to feel the brunt of it in a disparate fashion,\" said Michelle Holder, a distinguished senior fellow at Washington Center for Equitable Growth. \"Now, this is one report, but I pretty much believe that this is going to be the pattern over the next few months, particularly if the Fed continues to aggressively implement its approach.\" Like others, Holder agrees that it's too early to attribute a cause to the decline in Black labor force participation, but called attention to rising unemployment among Black female workers. The group saw its unemployment rate rise from 5.3% in July to 5.9%. In comparison, white female workers saw their unemployment rate tick up to 2.8% from 2.6%. Hispanic female workers also experienced a sharp increase in their unemployment rate, rising to 4.3% from 3.2% in July. While the unemployment rate did rise at a faster clip among Hispanic workers compared to white workers and the overall jobs market, the group's labor force participation rate and employment trend seem to mimic the broader market, Gould said. \"We're seeing this rise in unemployment as accompanied by a significant increase in participation and then uptake as well in employment,\" she said. \"I think that's a hopeful sign. The fact that the unemployment rate moves up is not a troubling thing on its own.\" \u2014 CNBC's Gabriel Cortes contributed to this report."},

The defendants, Aimee Harris, 40, and Robert Kurlander, 58, conspired to steal items from Florida and transport them over state lines in September 2020, when Ashley's father was the Democratic nominee for the White House, according to a charging document. Kurlander as part of his plea in U.S. District Court in Manhattan agreed to cooperate with federal prosecutors, who are continuing to investigate how the diary was obtained by Project Veritas, the right-wing group that specializes in provocative videos and investigations designed to embarrass media outlets and other targets. Neither Biden was identified by name in the charging document released Thursday. But the details of the case match with what has been previously reported about an investigation by federal prosecutors in New York into the theft of Ashley's diary, which occurred weeks before the 2020 presidential election. The charging document says the father of the theft's victim was a \"then-former government official who was a candidate for national office.\" President Biden is a former U.S. senator and vice president. Ashley's diary, which she had left in a Delray Beach, Florida, home she was renting, and other items were ultimately sold for $40,000 to Project Veritas, which has offices in Mamaroneck, New York. Harris, who is a resident of Palm Beach, later temporarily stayed at the same residence where Ashley had lived, and discovered items that included a journal with \"highly personal entries\" and a digital storage card that the victim left behind, according to the charging document. The charging document says Project Veritas purchased the stolen property from Harris and the Jupiter resident Kurlander paid each of them $20,000. The charging document says that Harris asked Kurlander for his assistance in selling certain items of the victim's property. The document said that Harris and Kurlander in September 2020 attended a campaign fundraiser in Florida for a person, identified as Candidate-2, who was running against the victim's father. That fundraiser is understood to be one held for then-President Donald Trump. Four days later, a representative from Trump's campaign told Harris and Kurlander that the campaign was not interested in buying the stolen property, the charging document says. Kurlander then texted Harris, saying, \"[Candidate-2] campaign can't use it. They want it to go to the FBI. There is NO WAY [Candidate-2] can use this. It has to be done a different way.\" Manhattan U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in a statement Thursday, \"Harris and Kurlander stole personal property from an immediate family member of a candidate for national political office.\" \"They sold the property to an organization in New York for $40,000 and even returned to take more of the victim's property when asked to do so,\" Williams said. \"Harris and Kurlander sought to profit from their theft of another person's personal property, and they now stand convicted of a federal felony as a result,\" he said. Both defendants face a possible maximum sentence of five years in prison on the charge of conspiracy to commit interstate transportation of stolen property. They each agreed to forfeit $20,000 as part of their guilty pleas. FBI agents last November searched several locations that belonged to current and former members of Project Veritas as part of the probe of the Biden diary theft. Project Veritas CEO James O'Keefe, in a statement issued at that time, said that the organization had been approached by people offering it the Biden diary. But O'Keefe said the group decided not to publish the contents of the diary, and later turned it over to law enforcement when Ashley's lawyer refused to accept it. \"At the end of the day, we made the ethical decision that because, in part, we could not determine if the diary was real, if the diary in fact belonged to Ashley Biden, or if the contents of the diary occurred, we could not publish the diary and any part thereof,\" O'Keefe said at the time."},

Biden made one of the most influential policy decisions of his presidency Wednesday when he announced the cancellation of up to $10,000 in federal student loan debt for borrowers earning under $125,000 a year or $250,000 for married couples or heads of households. Pell Grant recipients can have up to $20,000 of debt canceled. The debt relief is capped at the amount of the borrower's outstanding debt, according to the Education Department. Some congressional Republicans immediately sought to undermine Biden's debt forgiveness plan. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., called it a \"radical agenda.\" \"Biden's debt transfer scam will make inflation even worse and does nothing to stop the runaway cost of college for most families,\" McCarthy posted on Twitter Wednesday. \"Americans cannot afford Democrats' radical agenda.\" Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene called the loan forgiveness policy \"unfair\" in an interview on conservative news network Newsmax TV. \"Taxpayers all over the country ... they shouldn't have to pay off the great, big student loan debt for some college student that piled up massive debt going to some Ivy League school,\" Greene said. The Georgia Republican added that Biden's debt forgiveness policy is a scheme to bring in Democratic votes during the November midterm elections. But public records show that Greene was the beneficiary of loan forgiveness in the early months of the pandemic. A Paycheck Protection Program loan of $182,200 given to Greene's company, Taylor Commercial Inc., in April 2020 was forgiven with accrued interest, according to records maintained by ProPublica. And wealthy Americans benefited from a nearly $2 trillion tax loophole after former President Donald Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act \u2014 passed by a Republican-controlled Congress \u2014 into law in 2017. Three-quarters of the benefit from the tax cuts outlined in the act would go to the top 1% of earners, per an analysis by the Tax Foundation. Biden's debt forgiveness policy is projected to cost the federal government around $244 billion, according to higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. Forgiveness for Pell Grant recipients will cost an additional $120 billion. The debt forgiveness plan also extends the pause on student loan debt repayments to Dec. 31, 2022. Over 40 million Americans owe $1.7 trillion in student loan debt."},

The order Thursday came hours after the Department of Justice submitted a proposal in U.S District Court for the Southern District of Florida detailing how it wanted portions of that affidavit kept secret if the document were to be made public. That proposal itself is sealed, making it impossible to know what the DOJ wants to be kept hidden in the search warrant affidavit. But Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart in his order wrote that he agreed the DOJ \"has met its burden\" in showing there was a compelling reason to keep portions of the affidavit out of the public eye. Reinhart said the redactions were warranted because disclosure would reveal the identities of law enforcement agents, witnesses, and uncharged parties, as well as \"the investigation's strategy\" and direction, and \"grand jury information.\" FBI agents, carrying the warrant issued on the basis of the affidavit, on Aug. 8 raided Trump's residence at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach. They seized a dozen or so boxes of documents as part of a criminal investigation of the removal of presidential records from the White House when he left office in January 2021. Many of those documents were highly classified. The DOJ probe is eyeing possible obstruction of justice and violations of the U.S. espionage act and the law prohibiting the removal of official records. By law, presidential records must be given to the National Archives and Records Administration when a president leaves office. A group of media organizations had asked Reinhart to unseal the entire affidavit. That document, like other such affidavits submitted with search warrant applications, would detail why authorities believed there was probable cause that a crime had been committed. The affidavit also would describe what evidence authorities believed might be at the target location. But Reinhart, in his order Thursday, wrote, \"I further find that the Government has met its burden of showing that its proposed redactions are narrowly tailored to serve the Government's legitimate interest in the integrity of the ongoing investigation and are the least onerous alternative to sealing the entire Affidavit.\""},

From 1991 to 2000, global insured losses from floods was about $30 billion. In the next decade, global insured losses from floods was $40 billion, and from 2011 to 2020, global insured losses from floods was $80 billion, according to Swiss Re. In the first year of the next decade alone, 2021, insured losses were $20 billion, Swiss Re said. That's only a fraction of the total losses from flooding. In the decade from 2011 to 2020, 82 percent of global economic losses from floods was uninsured, according to Swiss Re. Population growth, the growth of cities, and the increasing intensity of flooding events due to climate change are to blame for the surge in the damage done by floods. \"Climate change is increasing likelihood of high-intensity, heavy rain and short-duration floods events associated with tropical cyclones,\" the report from Swiss Re said. Currently, Pakistan is struggling to recover from deadly floods that have killed more than 1,000 people and injured many more, according to Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the Secretary-General of the United Nations. \"Pakistan is awash in suffering. The Pakistani people are facing a monsoon on steroids \u2014 the relentless impact of epochal levels of rain and flooding,\" Guterres said on Monday. \"As we continue to see more and more extreme weather events around the world, it is outrageous that climate action is being put on the back burner as global emissions of greenhouse gases are still rising, putting all of us \u2013 everywhere \u2013 in growing danger,\" Guterres said. In the United States, almost 40% of the population lives in coastal counties and another 10% in floodplains. \"Despite the private flood insurance market gaining traction over the last few years, too many people are still not covered for flooding and the majority of those impacted by these events are uninsured, leaving them to pick up the pieces at their own expense,\" Keith Wolfe, president of property and casualty for Swiss Re in the US, said in a written statement. Extreme rainfall can cause flooding anywhere, said Swiss Re. \"Flood risk is in a lot more places than your mortgage company tells you,\" Wolfe said. For the insurance industry, the ability to properly insure properties for flooding risk is improving due to better date and more granular risk mapping, Swiss Re said. It's still not perfect, though. The accuracy for measuring flood risk has improved but it still \"remains limited,\" the report said. ."},

Although the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration hasn't issued a formal decision, a determination may arrive in the coming days, a spokesperson told CNBC. However, the state doesn't conform to the federal code \"in any significant way,\" according to the Tax Foundation, making forgiven student debt likely to be taxable without state action. While the Massachusetts Department of Revenue hasn't made a final determination, state Rep. Steve Owens, a Democrat, on Wednesday said in a tweet that student loan forgiveness won't be taxable. What's more, the state has already issued guidance on conforming to the American Rescue Plan's exclusion, Owens said in a separate tweet. A state provision to conform with the American Rescue Plan Act's exemption was not approved during the last session of the state legislature, a spokesperson for the Minnesota Department of Revenue told CNBC. \"If the state does not conform to this federal law, then Minnesota taxpayers who have their student debt discharged will have to add back this amount for Minnesota income tax purposes,\" the spokesperson said. The Mississippi Department of Revenue has confirmed with CNBC that student loan forgiveness will be taxable at the state level. Student loan forgiveness is \"currently considered taxable income,\" according to a press release on Wednesday from the North Carolina Department of Revenue. However, the department is monitoring legislation changes from the state's General Assembly. With the state tax law conforming before the American Rescue Plan Act, it's possible Wisconsin may tax student loan forgiveness, according to the Tax Foundation.

Here are the August delivery numbers for the three companies: Nio was the only company to grow on a monthly basis in August but U.S.-listed shares of the EV start-up closed over 5% lower. Li Auto shares fell 3% while Xpeng was slumped more than 6%. In Friday morning trade, Hong Kong-listed shares of Nio and Li Auto slipped 0.6% and 0.3%, respectively. Xpeng shares in the city fell 2%. The Chinese economy is facing a number of challenges including a resurgence of Covid-19 that has seen major cities like Shanghai locked down. In the last few days Shenzhen, China's tech hub has enacted Covid restrictions and on Thursday, the mega city of Chengdu went into lockdown. While some cities may have opened up again, consumer sentiment remains fragile and uncertainty prevails as a result of China's \"zero-Covid\" policy. The world's second-largest economy is also facing a power crunch which is impacting electric vehicle charging stations. Last month, Tesla and Nio suspended some of their charging services. These issues are filtering through to EV sales. Bill Russo, CEO at Shanghai-based Automobility, told CNBC, the numbers are \"reflective of lingering supply chain issues as well as the fact that they're on the premium end of the price range and with the weakening economy, people are looking toward affordability and that's squeezing some of the higher priced models.\" Last month, Xpeng said it expects to deliver between 29,000 and 31,000 electric vehicles in the third quarter of the year. This guidance disappointed investors. Xpeng President Brian Gu said the guidance reflects the fact that the industry is entering a \"relatively slow season\" and that traffic in stores is less due to the Covid situation. Yanan Shen, president of Li Auto, said in an earnings call last month that the Covid outbreak \"severely affected\" the company's supply chains and that there are remaining \"disruptions and difficulties.\" Shen also said there had been a slowdown in order intake for its flagship Li One sports utility vehicle. Li Auto began to deliver its new L9 car to customers at the end of August. And the company said it is planning to launch and deliver a large SUV called the Li L8 in early November. That could be affecting sales of its Li One, according to Russo. \"Li has major new product launches with the L9 and L8 which is also impacting consumer demand for Li One. When new products come out, demand for the older model often suffers,\" Russo said.

Here's what to expect for both new and used car prices", "tag": "Personal Finance", "author": "Sarah O'Brien", "datetime": "2022-09-01 17:03:26", "paragraphs": " In pre-pandemic years, Labor Day sales events offered generous discounts on new cars as dealerships aimed to clear out current-year models and start selling the next year's versions. These days? Not so much. The average new-car discount offered by manufacturers is down an estimated 47.1% from a year ago to $969, according to a recent forecast from J.D. Power and LMC Automotive. August marked the fourth consecutive month of incentives trending below $1,000. More from Personal Finance:\nHere's how to combat inflation with Labor Day deals\n50% of employers expect job cuts, survey finds\nAmericans spend $314 a month on impulse purchases At the same time, the average price for a new car reached an estimated $46,259 in August \u2014 11.5% higher than a year ago and the highest on record, according to the J.D. Power/LMC forecast. \"Shoppers waiting for Labor Day sales events with substantial discounts on outgoing model-year vehicles will be frustrated by the lack of markdowns and choice of vehicles,\" said Thomas King, president of the data and analytics division at J.D. Power, in the report. However, even as the average sales price for a new car continues pushing higher, Labor Day deal shoppers may find a general easing in prices for used vehicles. \"Car shoppers can't expect to find anything close to the doorbuster bargains of pre-pandemic Labor Day sales, but they can at least look forward to used car prices softening across the board heading into the holiday weekend,\" said Jessica Caldwell, executive director of insights at Edmunds. \"Although these price drops are not earth-shattering, they should be a welcome reprieve for consumers compared to the continued higher cost of new car purchases or leases,\" Caldwell said. As the calendar gets closer to 2023, used vehicles are getting older and racking up more mileage, so they generally are selling for less than they did earlier in the year, according to Edmunds. Additionally, an uptick in the number of near-new cars (no more than 2 years old) making their way to the used market via trade-ins is pushing down the price of 3-year-old vehicles. The average sales price for 3-year-old vehicles was $31,302 in July, down 4.6% from their peak of $32,828 in January. Across more than 200 models in that age group, 92.8% have experienced a price decline this year. For instance, a 2019 Ford Fusion Energi, a plug-in hybrid electric car, sold for an average $17,514 in July. That's a $3,776 drop \u2014 17.7% \u2014 from its $21,290 peak in March. For a 2019 GMC Yukon, a full-size SUV, the average price in July was $50,478, which is $6,602 lower, or 11.6%, than its high of $57,080 in January. There's also good news for those trading in a used car for one of those pricey new ones. The average trade-in in August was worth an estimated $10,011, a 32.7% jump from a year ago and the third consecutive month above $10,000, according to the J.D. Power/LMC report. The auto industry continues to operate in a challenging environment due to supply chain issues, including a persistent shortage of computer chips. That shortage has led to elevated prices in both the new and used markets as consumer demand remains strong. In August, an estimated 55% of vehicles were sold within 10 days of arriving at a dealership, according to the J.D. Power/LMC Automotive. The average number of days that new cars are on a dealer's lot before being sold is about 20 days, down from 25 days during the year-earlier period."},

The crash on June 3 i nvolved a Cruise vehicle, which does not require a human driver, braking harshly while making an unprotected left turn as an oncoming vehicle traveling about 40 mph \u2014 15 mph above the speed limit \u2014 switched from a right-turn lane to travel through the intersection. In public filings, federal regulators said the recalled software may \"incorrectly predict another vehicle's path or be insufficiently reactive to the sudden path change of a road user.\" Cruise said a software update in July was conducted to address the problem. Following the crash, Cruise said its robotaxi fleet continued to operate but that it temporarily prevented the vehicles from making unprotected left turns. It said it gradually reintroduced unprotected left turns after the software update. The crash was especially notable because it occurred a day after California regulators granted Cruise permission to commercialize its robotaxi fleet. It also happened amid increased scrutiny by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, part of the Department of Transportation, involving such vehicles and advanced driver-assist systems. Commercializing autonomous vehicles has been far more challenging than many predicted even a few years ago. The challenges have led to a consolidation in the autonomous vehicle sector after years of enthusiasm touting the technology as the next multitrillion-dollar market for transportation companies. In June, Cruise became the first company to offer unmanned fared rides to the public in a major city. The company for several years had been testing the vehicles, which are modified Chevrolet Bolt EVs, and was offering limited, non-fared rides to the public before then. The June crash was the only such incident in more than 123,560 driverless unprotected left turns prior to the software update, according to Cruise. The report also noted that law enforcement found the \"party at most fault\" for the collision was the other vehicle, according to the filings. When the crash occurred, the Cruise vehicle \"had to decide between two different risk scenarios and chose the one with the least potential for a serious collision at the time, before the oncoming vehicle's sudden change of direction,\" according to Cruise. In July, NHTSA said it was investigating the incident, with the assistance of Cruise, a majority-owned subsidiary of GM."},

The move sees the former NASA chief throw his experience and reputation behind a startup with a unique propellant technology. Bridenstine has joined up with larger, established organizations since leaving the space agency. Bridenstine served at NASA during former President Donald Trump's administration, and now holds a variety of roles within the space industry \u2013 including as senior advisor to private equity group Acorn Growth, and on the boards of Viasat and The Aerospace Corp. El Segundo, California-based Phase Four builds next-generation electric thrusters for small satellites, with six operating in orbit so far. The company has raised about $30 million in funding since its founding in 2015. Bridenstine told CNBC that Phase Four's approach of using radio frequency to utilize a wide variety of propellant types \u2013 including xenon, krypton, iodine and water \u2013 is \"going to be an absolute game changer for these proliferated [low Earth orbit satellite] constellations.\" Phase Four's propellant flexibility gives the company stability in the face of a geopolitical threat, Bridenstine said. Noble gases xenon and krypton \u2014 often used as spacecraft propellants \u2014 are \"not widely available\" and largely produced in Russia, Ukraine and China. \"The idea that we can get away from those traditional fuels and get into things like iodine and water, I think [should] significantly drop costs and create an environment where you don't have as many opportunities for disruption,\" Bridenstine said. That supply chain threat is also a focus of the Pentagon's work in space. \"I think the Space Force is very interested in making sure that that we do have consistent supply chains that are not at risk, and we don't have to be spending money with countries that aren't friendly with us,\" Bridenstine added. Phase Four has contracts to develop and produce thrusters from the Air Force and DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, as well as commercial orders from companies like Capella Space. The company has 32 employees and is expanding into a 23,000-square-foot facility in Hawthorne, California. It plans to raise another funding round in 2023 and to grow to about 50 people over the next 12 months. CEO Beau Jarvis told CNBC that his relationship with Bridenstine dates back to when Jarvis was a vice president at satellite imagery company Planet and the latter was a congressman. At the time, Bridenstine was \"trying to make it easier for small space companies to be able to work with the Department of Defense, or more broadly, the U.S. government,\" Jarvis said. \"Seeing some of what Jim has talked about more recently, in terms of having more sustainable space operations, and the potential for debris issues in space ... there's a lot of overlap [between] Jim's vision and our vision,\" Jarvis said."},

And a lot of people still don't get it,\" Cramer said. While market sentiment improved from mid-June to mid-August, Cramer said Okta 's nearly 40% decline Thursday is evidence that money-losing companies are still out of style in the Wall Street fashion show. \"Okta's now a pariah, along with hundreds of other companies \u2014 especially the ubiquitous and, in some cases, ruinous software companies \u2014 that embraced the same strategy: pursuing revenue growth at the cost of profitability,\" Cramer said.

The majority wrote, \"when an employer interferes in any way with its employees' right to display union insignia, the employer must prove special circumstances that justify its interference.\" Tesla did not demonstrate special circumstances that justified its policy, the NLRB decided. Tesla had previously argued before the NLRB that its dress code was meant to prevent workers' clothing from \"causing mutilations\" to the cars or car seats they were building, and to help managers \"easily determine that employees are in their assigned work areas,\" of the company's factory.

The Japanese gaming giant launched PlayStation Studios Mobile Division on Monday and said it will run independently of the console business. Sony also said on Monday it acquired Helsinki- and Berlin-based mobile game developer Savage Game Studios. The move comes after a tough second quarter for Sony's gaming division, and the company's downgrading of its full-year profit forecast for the business as the Covid-induced boom \u2014 during which people were stuck at home playing video games \u2014 begins to fade. Sony also continues to face supply chain issues and cannot meet the demand for its flagship PlayStation 5 console. Sony has dominated the console market for several years, thanks to the PlayStation. But the company is now looking to diversify. This year, the Japanese gaming giant said it plans to release around 50% of games on PC and mobile by 2025, up from about a quarter currently. \"For that to happen, Sony needs to make big bets on mobile gaming,\" Serkan Toto, CEO of Tokyo-based game industry consultancy Kantan Games, told CNBC. And the opportunity is big. Consoles account for about 27% of the $196.8 billion games market, whereas mobile makes up more than half of revenues, according to Newzoo. The purchase of Savage Game Studios continues Sony's recent acquisition drive as it looks to boost the development of titles across platforms. \"PlayStation Studios must continue to expand and diversify our offering beyond console, bringing incredible new games to more people than ever before,\" said Hermen Hulst, head of PlayStation studios. \"Acquiring the talented team at Savage Game Studios is another strategic step towards that goal.\" Sony said that Savage Game Studios is working on an \"unannounced new AAA mobile live service action game.\" A \"triple A\" game is an informal industry classification usually for a blockbuster type of title. A live service game is usually a title where developers continually update and add content to extend its lifetime and generate revenue over a longer period of time. The success of Call of Duty Mobile and Diablo Immortal on mobile, both of which were originally designed for console and PC, show there is demand for well-known titles on smaller screens \"if executed well,\" according to Daniel Ahmad, senior analyst at Niko Partners. Sony's mobile strategy is likely to lean on its massive library of intellectual property (IP) but also with a focus on developing specific games for smaller devices, Kantan Games' Toto said. \"Sony is very likely to not only bring existing PlayStation IPs to mobile but also encourage studios to develop new franchises for smart devices from scratch,\" Toto said. Sony is the latest console maker to make a big step into mobile gaming. Microsoft's Xbox gaming unit has also begun making early moves into mobile. Nintendo has, for the last three years, also been focusing a lot of effort on the smaller screen gaming format. Globally, Sony will compete with companies it hadn't really before, particularly Chinese giants Tencent and NetEase \u2014 two of the world's largest mobile gaming players. But Toto said Sony's chances of success are still high. \"The mobile gaming market is overcrowded. There are over 1 million games in app stores nowadays. But players such as Sony, even if they are new entrants, can still make it just because of their fire power,\" Toto told CNBC. \"There are not many companies like Sony out there, with such strong branding, a whole range of high-performing studios and a treasure trove of valuable IPs.\""},

Axios first reported the Google statement. The restriction means that Android users, who make up 44% of smartphone users in the U.S., can't download the app. Google will not let the app go live until the content issues are addressed. Truth Social acknowledged Google's concerns and said it would work on addressing these issues, according to Axios. Trump Media and Technology Group CEO Devin Nunes told a different story. The former lawmaker, who was one of former President Donald Trump's staunchest allies in Congress, said the decision is up to Google and not dependent on Truth Social's policies. \"When are we going to be available on Android? Well, look, that's up to the Google Play store. We're waiting on them to approve us, I don't know what's taking so long,\" Nunes said on the \"Just the News Not Noise\" podcast. \"It sure would be nice if they would approve us.\" Google said that Nunes' statements misrepresent the ongoing dialogue between Trump Media and the Play store. Google reiterated that Truth Social's violations, and the steps to redress them, have been clearly communicated with the company. Trump Media pushed back, saying Truth Social was creating a \"vibrant, family-friendly environment.\" \"TMTG has no desire to litigate its business matters in the public sphere, but for the record, has promptly responded to all inquiries from Google,\" the company said in a press release Tuesday. \"It is our belief that all Americans should have access to Truth Social no matter what devices they use. We look forward to Google approving Truth Social at their earliest convenience.\" Trump Media and Technology Group made the app available for preorder on Android in early August. It is available on Apple's App Store. Google's YouTube has suspended Trump's channel. Android users can still access Truth Social through the platform's website. The restriction is one of several obstacles faced by the former president's app. Truth Social was created as a \"free-speech\" alternative to Twitter, after Trump was banned from the platform for his tweets relating to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Hundreds of the president's supporters stormed the building that day to try to block Congress from confirming Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election. Trump, who had about 88 million followers on Twitter, has about 4 million followers on Truth Social, where he continues to push false claims about the election. He is facing a criminal investigation over secret government records he took with him to his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida and is considering another run for the White House. Trump Media was set to go public through a merger with Digital World Acquisition Corporation, a special-purpose acquisition company. The deadline is Sept. 8, although DWAC is pushing for a delay of up to a year. DWAC warned shareholders that a decline in the former president's popularity could hurt the app and that, without a delay, the acquisition company may have to liquidate. DWAC scheduled a shareholder meeting for Sept. 6, two days before the current merger deadline. Shares of the company were down more than 2% Tuesday at $24.65, far from their peak of about $97 in March."},

In a conversation, Laszlo Bock, Google's HR chief at the time, said he \"suggested Page could more easily clear the way for his chosen successor by moving Wojcicki to YouTube.\u201d The announcement of Wojcicki's appointment came as a shock to many Googlers, the book says. Wojcicki had one of the earliest connections to Google -- in 1998, she famously let Page and Brin, who still hold majority shareholder voting power of Google parent company Alphabet, work from her garage when they were starting the company. Her sister, 23andMe founder Anne Wojcicki was married and had kids with Brin. In the book, Bock compared Google to a family enterprise, and the book says Wojcicki often was able to get Page's attention. \u201cWhen people couldn\u2019t get him to see reason, she always could,\u201d said former Google director and early Silicon Valley workplace influencer Kim Scott, who referred to her in the book as \u201ca Larry whisperer.\u201d One example is how Google used search data. \"Wojcicki wanted to use search queries to inform ads people saw on all those banner ads Google ran across the web; if advertisers could target consumers based on searches and on websites, they might spend gobs more with Google,\" the book says. Page had long wanted to keep search data from everything else but Wojcicki \"felt this wasn\u2019t keeping up with trends in the ad industry, which sought ever more data.\u201d \u201cThe founders trust Susan maybe more than anybody on the planet,\" Patrick Keane, an early Google sales director, said in the book. \u201cYou could never get Susan rattled, no matter how challenging the moment was.\u201d YouTube was also discussed as a potential spinout, the book reports. The year after Wojcicki\u2019s appointment, in 2015, Larry Page, announced the creation of Alphabet, a new holding company, that would separate several businesses, including self-driving car Waymo and health sciences unit Verily, from Google. \u201cYouTube seemed like a natural splinter; it already operated with a different name and office,\" the book states. \"Leaders there considered plans to become a separate Alphabet unit, detached from Google. Wojcicki wanted to keep reporting to Page, who had appointed himself Alphabet CEO, rather than his successor at Google, Sundar Pichai. But ultimately it was decided YouTube was too intertwined with Google\u2019s business and machinery to leave. So it stayed at Google.\" Under Wojcicki's watch, YouTube grew to reach more than 81% of U.S. adults and generate nearly $29 billion in revenue in 2021."},

The company will invest up to $1 billion in the new factory, which it plans to build in the Southeast of the U.S. The newly announced plant will be the panel maker's fourth fully integrated U.S. factory. First Solar also said Tuesday that it will spend $185 million upgrading and expanding its existing facilities in Ohio. CEO Mark Widmar pointed to the IRA as the key catalyst that made the company decide to build another factory in the U.S. rather than looking elsewhere. The funding packages create, for the first time, a \"long-term view and understanding of the industry, and policies aligned to that industry,\" he told CNBC. \"With that level of clarity, we stepped back and evaluated the alternatives or the options of where we could go with our next factory and when we looked at it comprehensively the U.S. was a very attractive option,\" he said. Widmar added that this is the first time the entire supply chain has been incentivized, from the manufacturer to the generating asset and finally to the end customer. \"With that type of alignment, you can create partnerships and opportunities to grow together collectively and more of a win-win type of structure than maybe we had before the implementation of the IRA,\" he said. First Solar said the new factory will manufacture 3.5 gigawatts of solar modules annually by 2025, with the company's Ohio facilities posting cumulative annual production capacity of over 7 GW by 2025. By comparison, the U.S. added 3.9 GW of solar capacity during the first quarter of 2022, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. The country's total solar industry now stands at 126.1 GW, which is enough to power 22 million homes, according to SEIA. Shares of First Solar have surged 65% since the end of July when Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V. announced their surprise agreement on the climate, health care and tax bill. The legislation, which swiftly passed the House and Senate and was signed into law by President Joe Biden, benefits First Solar in several ways, including through the production tax credit for domestic manufacturers. First Solar is the largest U.S.-based developer of solar panels, with a focus on utility-scale panels. The factory announcement comes as First Solar struggles to keep pace with booming demand. During its second quarter earnings call, First Solar said it's sold out through 2025, with a backlog of 44 GW. Widmar said First Solar wants to move quickly when building out its new factory. One of the company's considerations is a site that's as close to shovel-ready as possible. Other factors include the type and availability of workers in the area. First Solar is aiming to have identified the site by the end of the current quarter. \"I think the industry is in the best position it ever has been\u2026for growth beyond any expectations that anyone would have envisioned,\" Widmar said."},

Twitter shares were down more than 1% in premarket trade. The latest filings come after Twitter's former head of security, Peiter \"Mudge\" Zatko, earlier this month alleged\"extreme, egregious deficiencies\" by the social media company related to privacy, security and content moderation. On July 8, Musk 's legal team initially filed a notice with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to terminate the Twitter acquisition. Musk's team alleged that \"Twitter has not complied with its contractual obligations.\" The follow-up notice, disclosed to the SEC, cites allegations made by Zatko as additional reasons to terminate the deal. \"Allegations regarding certain facts, known to Twitter prior to and as of July 8, 2022, but undisclosed to the Musk Parties prior to and at that time, have since come to light that provide additional and distinct bases to terminate the Merger Agreement,\" Mike Ringler, Musk's legal representative from Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, wrote in a letter to Twitter's legal chief, Vijaya Gadde. Ringler said in the letter that the latest termination notice is \"not legally necessary\" to end the merger deal, but is being delivered in case the July 8 filing is \"determined to be invalid for any reason.\" The letter on behalf of Musk said the Zatko complaint \"alleges far-reaching misconduct at Twitter\u2014all of which was disclosed to Twitter's directors and senior executives, including (CEO) Parag Agrawal\u2014that is likely to have severe consequences for Twitter's business.\" Musk's lawyer said Zatko alleges that Twitter is in \"material noncompliance\" with its obligations under its 2011 agreement with the Federal Trade Commission. The letter laid out some of Zatko's other allegations including claims that Twitter is \"uniquely vulnerable to systemic disruption resulting from data center failures or malicious actors,\" something senior management knew about but \"ignored and sought to obfuscate.\" \"These allegations, if true, demonstrate that Twitter has breached the following provisions of the Merger Agreement, thereby giving the Musk Parties the right to terminate the Merger Agreement pursuant to its terms,\" the letter said. Twitter's legal team responded on Tuesday by sending a letter to Musk's legal representatives. Twitter said Musk's termination case is \"invalid and wrongful under\" the acquisition agreement. \"It is based solely on statements made by a third party that, as Twitter has previously stated, are riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies and lack important context,\" the letter written by William Savitt of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz law firm said. \"Contrary to the assertions in your letter, Twitter has breached none of its representations or obligations under the Agreement, and Twitter has not suffered and is not likely to suffer a Company Material Adverse Effect.\" Twitter said it intends to enforce the acquisition agreement and \"close the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon\" with Musk. Twitter's legal team said Musk's latest notice to terminate the deal is \"invalid for the independent reason that Mr. Musk and the other Musk Parties continue to knowingly, intentionally, willfully, and materially breach\" the acquisition agreement. The social media giant has previously responded to Zatko. In a memo to staff posted to Twitter on Aug. 23 by CNN correspondent Donie O'Sullivan, Agrawal described Zatko as \"a former Twitter executive who was terminated in January 2022 for ineffective leadership and poor performance.\" Zatko's attorneys issued a statement on Monday in response to that characterization, saying he \"put his career on the line because of his concerns about Twitter users, the public, and the company's shareholders.\" Twitter and Musk will go on trial on Oct. 17 in Delaware to resolve Musk's attempt to cancel his acquisition of the company unless they reach a settlement first. Since proposing the Twitter takeover, Musk has complained that the number of fake or spam accounts on the social media platform is higher than is being disclosed. In the July 8 letter, Musk's legal team claimed the company had \"failed or refused to provide\" information on these accounts to the Tesla CEO. Ahead of the October trial, Musk's legal team has subpoenaed Zatko, seeking information on the company's spam accounts and its alleged security vulnerabilities. \u2014 CNBC's Lora Kolodny contributed to this report."},

In a series of letters sent Tuesday morning, the committee asked four agencies, including the Department of the Treasury, the Federal Trade Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as five digital asset exchanges \u2014 Coinbase, FTX, Binance.US, Kraken, and KuCoin \u2014 for information and documents about what they are doing, if anything, to safeguard consumers against scams and combat cryptocurrency-related fraud. More than $1 billion in crypto has been lost to fraud since the start of 2021, according to research from the FTC. \"As stories of skyrocketing prices and overnight riches have attracted both professional and amateur investors to cryptocurrencies, scammers have cashed in,\" wrote Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D.-Ill., Chair of the Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy. \"The lack of a central authority to flag suspicious transactions in many situations, the irreversibility of transactions, and the limited understanding many consumers and investors have of the underlying technology make cryptocurrency a preferred transaction method for scammers.\" The letters ask that the federal agencies and crypto exchanges respond by Sept. 12 with information about what they are doing to protect consumers. The committee says that these responses could be used to craft legislative solutions. In particular, the letters ask that the exchanges produce documents dating back through Jan. 1, 2009, which display efforts to combat crypto scams and fraud, as well as show attempts made to \"identify, investigate, and remove or flag potentially fraudulent digital assets or accounts,\" as well as highlight discussions around \"whether to adopt more stringent policies.\" In one letter, addressed to Sam Bankman-Fried, the CEO and founder of FTX, the committee notes that \"while some exchanges review cryptocurrencies before listing them, others allow digital assets to be listed with little or no vetting.\" Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis found that 37% of crypto scam revenue last year went to \"rug pulls,\" a type of scheme that involves developers listing a token on an exchange, pumping it up, and then vanishing with the funds. Binance.US, which also received an inquiry from the committee on Tuesday, has been accused in a class action lawsuit of misleading consumers about the safety of investing in the U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin known as terraUSD (or UST, for short) and its sister token, luna. At their height, luna and UST had a combined market value of almost $60 billion. Now, they're essentially worthless. Concern over the safety of crypto funds parked on centralized platforms has also been gaining traction following the recent collapse of Voyager Digital and Celsius, both popular apps among retail traders because of the double-digit annual percentage yield once offered by the two companies. The subsequent bankruptcies of these two platforms have highlighted the question of who owns cryptocurrency assets when a custodial business goes belly up. In the bankruptcy proceedings of both Voyager and Celsius, customers are considered unsecured creditors, rather than federally-insured bank depositors, meaning there is no guarantee they will get any of their money back. As for the relationship between investor and crypto exchange, the terms and conditions vary. In a financial filing released in May, Coinbase said its users would be treated as \"general unsecured creditors\" in the event of bankruptcy. Krishnamoorthi also noted that the agencies often seem to be acting at cross-purposes and giving inconsistent guidance to private-sector players. \"Without clear definitions and guidance, agencies will continue their infighting and will be unable effectively to implement consumer and investor protections related to cryptocurrencies and the exchanges on which they are traded.\""},

The Hangzhou, China-headquartered firm bought Quantic Dream, marking the establishment of its first fully owned gaming studio in Europe. NetEase and its rival Tencent have been upping their efforts overseas as the Chinese domestic games market slows down amid tighter regulation. Over the years, Tencent has been prolific in acquisitions and investments in overseas gaming companies. NetEase is now catching up. This year alone, NetEase has set up gaming studios in Japan and the U.S. NetEase has typically been focused on PC and mobile gaming, extremely popular formats in China. Mobile gaming makes up more than half of its global games revenues. But more recently, the tech giant has been expanding into console games. Quantic Dream, a 25-year-old studio, will focus \"on creating and publishing its video games on all platforms, as well as supporting and publishing third-party developed titles,\" according to a press release. That highlights NetEase's intention to grow across mobile, PC and consoles. The acquisition of Quantic Dream is in line with NetEase's strategy of acquiring well-known international characters and franchises. Quantic Dream is currently developing a game called Star Wars Eclipse, based on Disney's space adventure movies. NetEase has already released mobile games based on the Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter. NetEase's international push comes as regulators in China continue to scrutinize the games market, though there are signs of some easing. Last year, authorities restricted the amount of time those under 18 years old could play online games and froze the approval of new titles. In China, games need the green light from regulators to be released and monetized. Those approvals restarted in April. In an interview with CNBC last year, Hu Zhipeng, vice president at NetEase and one of the top bosses of the technology giant's video games business, said that he aims to eventually have 50% of the company's gaming revenue come from overseas, up from around 10% now. Competition in the global games market is heating up. Sony, a leader in console gaming and producer of the PlayStation, announced on Tuesday that it is setting up a dedicated mobile division, which will put it in competition with the likes of Chinese giants Tencent and NetEase."},

It's also working with dairy farmers to help them reduce emissions produced on their farms. While electricity and transportation tend to get most of the attention when it comes to global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, agriculture is a massive contributor. Breakthrough Energy Ventures has segmented global emissions into five categories, and agriculture is the third worst offender, responsible for 19% of total greenhouse gas emissions, behind manufacturing (31%) and electricity (27%), but ahead of transportation (16%) and buildings (7%). Neutral Foods milk is in about 2,000 grocery stores and has already received funding from a diverse roster of celebrity investors, including Mark Cuban, NBA stars LeBron James and Kevin Love, Tobias Harris, and musicians John Legend and Questlove. The company is planning to expand into butter, and eventually meat. \"It's clear that consumers are hungry for sustainable, climate-forward options and they're reflecting that in their purchasing decisions, especially when it comes to buying food and beverages,\" Carmichael Roberts, one half of the investing committee at Bill Gates' investment fund, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, told CNBC. Neutral Foods measures the carbon emissions of the entire lifecycle of its products and purchases carbon offsets for the measured emissions, Ann Radil, the Head of Carbon Reduction at Neutral Foods, told CNBC. Carbon credits are permits that businesses buy to certify greenhouse gasses have been removed from the atmosphere. While not all carbon credits are reliably policed, Neutral Foods says it uses only offsets verified by Climate Action Reserve (CAR), which it says are quite strict. CAR offsets are \"real, additional, permanent, verifiable, and enforceable,\" said Lauren Brown, senior manager of carbon reduction data and analytics for Neutral Foods. Long-term, the company's plan is to work with farms to reduce their greenhouse emissions directly. Currently, Neutral Foods has eight distinct projects underway at farms it works with and 30 projects in some phase of development, Radil told CNBC. Those projects include changing what cows eat and changing how cow manure is managed. Separating and composting manure \"alone can reduce manure-related GHG emissions like methane and nitrous oxide by 19 to 50 percent,\" Radil told CNBC. Also, Neutral Foods is working with farms to change the way they plant things on the farm to improve the amount of carbon that gets absorbed by the soil. The start-up both guides farmers to help them make changes in the operations on their farms to reduce emissions and then also provides the financing to make those changes, explains CEO Marcus Lovell Smith. Helping farmers lower the emissions on their farms requires approaching farmers with respect. \"You don't go onto a farm and tell a farmer what to do,\" said Smith, who runs his own dairy farm in New Hampshire. \"Farmers are one of the most independent minded groups of people in the country. So I learned that pretty quickly.\" One partner is Groeneveld Farms, a dairy farm with 240 cows, located in Snohomish County, Washington. The farm grows 90% of its feed, and Neutral Foods has helped it figure out how to plant two different crops -- corn and grass -- at the same time.This process, sometimes known as \"co-cropping\" or \"relay cropping\" means the farm only has to till the ground once, which decreases the amount of fossil fuels used on the farm. \"We can do this in a way that works really well for where we are located here in Washington,\" Groeneveld told CNBC. \"Neutral found this appealing and it's something that works within both of our collective budgets to try out.\" Neutral Foods started its product line with milk, which it currently sells at Amazon -owned Whole Foods, Target stores on the West Coast, Sprouts, and various other grocers. The price of Neutral Foods is \"pretty much in the middle of the pack for organic milk,\" CEO Smith said. Results so far are positive. \"We are pleased with how customers are reacting and purchasing the Neutral Foods products. Based on that, we are looking at other opportunities to expand with them into other items,\" said Sprouts spokesperson Steve Nieto. Starting in August, Neutral Foods will start selling carbon neutral pasture-raised butter, and it's planning to expand its product repertoire to include beef as well. Carman Ranch, located in the Wallowa Valley in northeast Oregon, raises cows and hogs. Owner Cory Carman, reached out to Neutral Foods to see they were working on any carbon emissions tracking programs for beef. \"We know that there are so many innovations in agriculture that can make a huge difference in greenhouse gas emissions or carbon sequestration, but discovering how those innovations play out in specific regions, or testing new ones is incredibly hard for individual ranchers,\" Carman told CNBC. Carman Ranch is what is called a \"century farm\" because the same family has worked the farm for over a hundred years. Cory herself grew up on the ranch and has worked at the ranch for the last two decades. \"Neutral has helped bring us technology, resources, and information that I would never had access to and that I am now sharing across my network.\" Carman Ranch has learned about feed supplements for cattle that lower the methane that cows belch out when they digest their food, Carman told CNBC. Currently, Carman Ranch is running trials with Neutral Foods to plant feed for their cows to graze on that contain condensed tannins. \"They are nutritious to our animals, promote soil health and can lower methane emissions,\" Carman told CNBC. Carman Ranch is also running a trial with Neutral Foods to put a seaweed supplement into the feed for 50 cattle. For this pilot program, Neutral Foods and the company making the seaweed supplement, Symbrosia, \"will bring leading researchers, partners, equipment, and procedures to measure methane emissions and weight gain, conduct a full life cycle analysis, and generate verified carbon credits,\" Carman said. It will take time for the projects Neutral Foods is doing with farms to be fully implemented and measurably reduce the emissions of their products, Radil told CNBC. But for now, Gates' investment fund is encouraged by the steps Neutral Foods is making. \"It sends a critical price signal to farmers that climate-forward practices have value. As they continue to improve upon those decarbonization techniques, there's an opportunity for scale at the farm level that can mirror the brand's growth and retail expansion,\" Roberts told CNBC. Fellow investor Marc Cuban, who put money into the company last October, agrees. \"I think consumers are becoming increasingly concerned about the impact of the products they consume on the environment,\" Cuban told CNBC. \"I think Neutral is well positioned to meet that demand.\""},

The Swedish payments firm generated revenues of 9.1 billion Swedish krona ($950 million) in the period spanning January to the end of June 2022. That was up 24% from a year ago. But the company also racked up hefty losses. Klarna's pre-tax loss soared more than threefold year-on-year to nearly 6.2 billion krona. In the first half of 2021, Klarna lost around 1.8 billion Swedish krona. The company, which allows users to spread the cost of purchases over interest-free installments, saw a jump in operating expenses and defaults. Operating expenses before credit losses came in at 10.8 billion Swedish krona, up from 6.3 billion krona year-over-year, driven by administrative costs related to its rapid international expansion in countries like the U.S. Credit losses, meanwhile, rose more than 50% to 2.9 billion Swedish krona. Klarna had previously been profitable for most of its existence \u2014 that is up until 2019, when the firm dipped into the red for the first time after a hike in investments aimed at growing the business globally. The company's ballooning losses highlight the price of its rapid expansion after the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. Klarna has entered 11 new markets since the start of 2020, and took a number of costly gambits to extend its foothold in the U.S. and Britain. In the U.S., Klarna has spent heavily on marketing and user acquisition in an effort to chip away at Affirm, its main rival stateside. In the U.K., meanwhile, the firm acquired PriceRunner, a price comparison site, in April. It has also engaged in a charm offensive with British politicians and regulators ahead of incoming regulations. More recently, Klarna has been forced to cut back. In May, the company slashed about 10% of its global workforce in a swift round of job cuts. The company subsequently raised raised funds at a $6.7 billion valuation \u2014 an 85% drop from its previous valuation \u2014 in an $800 million investment deal that defined the capitulation from high-growth tech firms as investors grew wary of a possible recession. The sharp discount reflected grim sentiment among investors in fintech in both the public and private markets, with publicly-listed fintech Affirm having lost about three quarters of its market value since the start of 2022. \"We've had to make some tough decisions, ensuring we have the right people, in the right place, focused on business priorities that will accelerate us back to profitability while supporting consumers and retailers through a more difficult economic period,\" said Sebastian Siemiatkowski, CEO and co-founder of Klarna. \"We needed to take immediate and pre-emptive action, which I think was misunderstood at the time, but now sadly we have seen many other companies follow suit.\" Klarna said it plans to tighten its approach to lending, particularly with new customers, to factor in the worsening cost-of-living situation. However, Siemiatkowski said, \"You won't see the impact of this on our financials in this report yet.\" \"We have a very agile balance sheet, especially in comparison to traditional banks due to the short-term nature of our products, but even for Klarna it takes a little while for the impact of decisions to flow through.\" Fintech companies are cutting expenses and delaying listing plans amid a worsening macroeconomic backdrop. Meanwhile, consumer-oriented services are losing their appeal among investors while so-called \"business-to-business\" fintechs attract the limelight. Klarna says it is now used by over 150 million people, while the company counts 450,000 merchants on its network. Klarna mainly generates income from retailers, not users, taking a small slice of each transaction processed through its platform. \"Ultimately they've proven there can be a profitable business there but have doubled down on growing in the U.S. market which is expensive,\" Simon Taylor, head of strategy at fintech startup Sardine.ai, told CNBC. \"Market share there will be meaningful for long-term revenue. But it takes time and the funding taps aren't what they used to be.\" But the company faces stiff competition, with titans in the realms of both tech and finance seeking to capitalize on growth in the buy now, pay later industry. Apple is set to launch its own BNPL product, Apple Pay Later, this fall, which will allow users to split the cost of their purchases over four equal monthly payments. Meanwhile, proposals are afoot to bring the BNPL market under regulatory supervision. In the U.K., the government has announced plans to enforce tighter affordability checks and a crackdown on misleading advertisements. Stateside, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau opened a market-monitoring probe into BNPL companies."},

Speaking to CNBC's \" Street Signs Asia\" on Wednesday, Sanjay Kapoor, who is now an independent analyst, said Indian mobile operator Reliance Jio's $25 billion plan to launch 5G network across the country indicates that India is \"very serious\" about 5G. 5G refers to the fifth generation of high-speed mobile internet which offers super-fast download speeds and more bandwidth that's capable of supporting technologies like driverless cars and virtual reality applications, including the metaverse. According to Reuters, Reliance is making a push to roll out its network within two months. It is also developing an affordable 5G smartphone with Google, according to the report. \"But when you look at what's happening \u2026 [in] China, for example, a single operator puts in more than $15 [billion], $16 billion every year, and they've been doing it for the last couple of years,\" said Kapoor. \"From an international perspective, [$25 billion] seems pretty okay. But in India, it looks really colossal.\" In July, India kicked off its 5G auction ahead of a planned 2023 rollout. Bidders include three of the country's major mobile operators in India \u2014 Reliance Jio, the market leader, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea \u2014 as well as Indian billionaire Gautam Adani's Adani Enterprises. Kapoor said the battle for the 72 gigahertz of 5G spectrum will be a \"two-horse race\" between Reliance and Bharti Airtel. \"They will be neck-to-neck [and] the strategies might differ,\" he added. Reliance Industries' Jio deposited 140 billion rupees of earnest money with the Indian government in July \u2014 it was the largest sum among the contenders. The amount of earnest money deposited is an indication of the amount of spectrum a company wishes to buy. Bharti Airtel deposited 55 billion rupees, while Vodafone Idea put in an earnest money deposit of 22 billion rupees. Reliance may have had a first-mover's advantage with its recent announcement, but Bharti Airtel's postpaid customer base could give it an edge over its rival, Kapoor said. However, what customers really value is their experience with a service provider, he pointed out. \"Therefore, each one of them will have to strive for supremacy in the market to make sure that they have a positive customer experience and are able to be competitive and world-class.\" But India's 5G infrastructure still has some way to go before that can happen, according to Kapoor. \"To give a sizable rollout in a country as large as India, it's not going to be very easy,\" he said. \"Do we have completely fiberized sites? China, for example, has a million sites already \u2026 and we [have] roughly, to each operator, about 250,000 sites.\" He added that India is going to need \"a lot more\" fiberized sites before it can give coverage to every nook and corner. Fibre infrastructure is the backbone of ultra-fast 5G networks, where a large availability of fiber-optic cables are required. \"To the time when we really can boast about giving a great customer experience, I think we are two, three years away,\" Kapoor said."},

CEO Evan Spiegel announced the moves in a memo Tuesday, and told employees the company needs to restructure its business to deal with its financial challenges. He said the company's current year-over-year revenue growth rate for the quarter of 8% \"is well below what we were expecting earlier this year.\" \"While we have built substantial capital reserves, and have made extensive efforts to avoid reductions in the size of our team by reducing spend in other areas, we must now face the consequences of our lower revenue growth and adapt to the market environment,\" Spiegel said. \"We are restructuring our business to increase focus on our three strategic priorities: community growth, revenue growth, and augmented reality.\" Other projects the company nuked include its Snap Minis third-party apps and Snap Games. Spiegel said Snap is also starting the \"process of winding down\" its Zenly map product and Voisey music feature, which were both inherited through acquisitions. Snap has also promoted Jerry Hunter from senior vice president of engineering to chief operating officer. Hunter will continue leading Snap's engineering unit, Spiegel said. The company said it hired Ronan Harris, Google's vice president and managing director of U.K. and Ireland, to be its president of the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, a new position. Harris will join Snap's executive team. Spiegel said Snap is currently searching for presidents of the company's Asia-Pacific and Americas regions, also two new roles. \"Changes of this magnitude are never easy, and we must act decisively to meet this moment as a team,\" Spiegel said. \"I am proud of the strength and resilience of our team as we have navigated the myriad challenges of growing our business in a highly competitive industry during uncertain and unprecedented times.\" In July, Snap shares cratered more than 25% after the company reported second-quarter results that missed on both the top and bottom lines and said it would not provide guidance for its current quarter. The company said at the time that it planned to \"substantially\" slow its hiring rate and operating expense growth rate. Like other social media companies, including Facebook parent Meta, Pinterest and Twitter, Snap said a confluence of factors has simultaneously hurt the company's business. They include a weakening macroeconomic environment and Apple 's 2021 iOS update, which made it more difficult for social media companies to track users on behalf of third-party advertisers. The rise of TikTok's short-video service has also posed a significant challenge for Snap and its competitors. Snap said it was scrapping development of its Pixy drone after reports surfaced that the company was pausing its work on the device. The drone was supposed to be a fun way for users to take photos of themselves from multiple angles. Snap has been trying to build a consumer hardware business and announced the $230 drone in April."},
{"url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/01/for-industrial-cobot-its-been-a-decade-in-search-of-a-permanent-job-.html", "title": "A robot named Baxter wanted to change the world of work, but his career ended early", "tag": "CNBC Disruptor 50", "author": "Eric Rosenbaum", "datetime": "2022-09-01 14:00:01", "paragraphs": " In this weekly series, CNBC takes a look at companies that made the inaugural Disruptor 50 list, 10 years later. One of the enduring lessons of the iPhone era is that Steve Jobs led with what the consumer didn't know they wanted until he showed it to them. Robotics pioneer Rodney Brooks has operated from a similar idea \u2014 with varying degrees of success. His robot vacuum cleaner Roomba, and its parent company iRobot, which more or less made the category of robotic vacuums an inexpensive, must-have for many consumers, was recently sold to Amazon for $1.7 billion. \"iRobot found a product-market fit. It had a feature set and a cost that lots and lots of people were willing to pay for, that puck-shaped thing that cleans the floor pretty well,\" said Matt Beane, an assistant professor in the technology management program at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and a robotics expert. But another of Brooks' big, early ideas, hasn't worked out the way he or the world imagined. Rethink Robotics was founded in 2008 with the idea that a cobot \u2014 a robot working alongside humans in ways that traditional automation couldn't (i.e. with much less danger to the human), and without the fencing that most industrial robots remained inside \u2014 was a market waiting to be made among industrial customers. But for all the novel ideas that Brooks and his Rethink colleagues brought to the table, its first cobot never caught on. It caught on in the press, for sure, and if you were following tech news at the beginning of the last decade you likely saw Baxter and \"his eyes\" staring out from the screen between his arms at some point in a photo or video footage. At CNBC, we learned firsthand the limitations of working with novel industrial robots when we invited Baxter on-air for a live segment as part of Rethink being named to the inaugural Disruptor 50 list in 2013. For technical reasons, it would have been a lot more difficult than we imagined to get Baxter onto the television studio set. While he may not be a part of the robotic future anymore, there is no history of the cobot that can be written without Baxter. \"There is no such thing as the cobot without Rod Brooks,\" Beane said. \"Rethink started the industry.\" After a lot of early fanfare, reality set in for Rethink. By 2018, it was struggling to scale its operations and find enough buyers for Baxter, with its two-armed design proving to be a novel idea, but a mistake. \"No one needs a two-armed robot,\" Beane said, describing that design decision as \"humans projecting onto a robot their own physical form.\" Rethink pivoted, in what turned out to be a move made too late, to a one-armed robot named Sawyer. But the technology had other problems. Rethink bet on an approach that used elastic actuators \u2014 a technology one of Brooks co-founders was an expert on \u2014 which allowed the robot to perform \"force sensing,\" an approach the company backed because it would make the robots safer around human coworkers. Rethink's design would also make the robots low cost, getting rid of standard industry reliance on motors and related parts. Paul Maeder, a mechanical engineer who invested early in Rethink through his VC firm, told the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in a post-mortem on Rethink that goes deep into the technical shortcomings, that cheaper parts plus force sensing seemed like the way to bring down pricing in the robotics market and appeal to customers. And it did bring down pricing. \"The reality is that they had a very low price point, shockingly low,\" Beane said. \"They had done an amazingly good job at materials sourcing and design, and they were headed to one-third or one-quarter of the price for other robots.\" But Rethink never achieved the market penetration or scale it needed to maintain its operations. As the financials worsened, Rethink became the acquisition target of a Chinese firm, a deal Beane says would have had a good shot at getting the firm to scale. But that deal was scuttled \"at the last moment,\" according to the company, and a 2018 bankruptcy followed. Rethink was bought out of bankruptcy by German automation company Hahn Group, which is still trying to make the technology a success today. In a statement provided to TechCrunch at the time of its demise, Rethink said, \"We were early to market with a very innovative product that was ahead of its time, and unfortunately, we did not achieve the commercial success we had expected.\" It's true Rethink had no shortage of interesting, innovative ideas, even if they weren't the right ones for the market. According to Beane, one of the most intriguing was the ability for the cobot to be programmed by the worker. \"People don't make much of this feature anymore, but that was a graphic user interface system which didn't require code and you could teach it, train it to do a job as the worker,\" Beane said. \"But no manager would turn those features on,\" he added. That's an idea that Brooks is still working on today, through his latest robotics startup Robust.ai, co-founded with cognitive scientist Gary Marcus, which is making a warehouse cobot, Carter, that is like a mobile shopping cart providing transport within fulfillment centers. \"It can drive in any direction and is worker programmable and can physically collaborate,\" Beane said. \"A lot of the same DNA is there.\" Once Sawyer became the lead cobot, Rethink invested in a technology that integrated the cobot with preexisting industrial automation, an interesting approach, but ultimately, another bottleneck that was costly in engineering time to connect and to get to communicate with machinery like conveyors. \"Just to alter the speed of a conveyor is extremely expensive,\" Beane said. The DNA that has become standard in the cobot market that Baxter, and later Sawyer, hoped to dominate, is from Rethink rival and Denmark-based Universal Robots. While its cobots may be \"very boring looking\" in Beane's view, they were what the market ultimately wanted. \"In the end, the series elastic actuators were probably not the best idea in the world,\" Maeder told ASME. \"What customers really want is a low-cost, simple, fast, repeatable robot. They want to put something in this exact location again, and again and again. In the end, that was a lot more complicated for us to achieve than for some of our competitors because they weren't trying to do force sensing.\" Even the two arms that Baxter had could always be purchased by a buyer if they really wanted that approach, by purchasing two single-arm robots, and that's what Universal Robots \u2014 which was acquired by industrial automation company Teradyne in 2015 \u2014 excels at, with its UR3, UR5 and UR7 cobots leading to increased sales, and successive generations of its cobot line continuing to hit the market. The opportunity for robotics technology remains significant, though it is still trailing other automation approaches in market penetration. Robot sales in the North American market have been growing, and the Teradyne unit led by Universal Robots is seeing steady, if not explosive, sales growth, too. Revenue was $300 million in 2019, and then increased to $376 million last year after a Covid dip. According to Wall Street estimates, sales could reach $440 million this year, or about 18% growth. That growth rate is higher than the percentage of overall revenue it represents, which is still under 15%. \"A lot more will occur,\" Beane said. \"Progress often looks slow up close ... but the utility of a robotic system that can accomplish general tasks at a reasonable cost is extraordinary, billions, maybe trillions worth of value,\" he added. And costs keep going down, from batteries to sensors and software, meaning the price performance for robots keeps going up steadily. But where the cobot finds its greatest utility remains an open question. While the industrial world use has been in the first decades often as much a marketing ploy or, at best, an experiment rather than proof of widespread adoption, there is reason to forecast multiple roles for cobots based on an aging demographic. \"Anyone who says not in my lifetime, you better hope it is in your lifetime, because you will need help,\" Beane said. He anticipates that jobs outside of the manufacturing sector with which cobots have been associated \u2014 from warehousing to retail, medical (think cobots bringing supplies to nurses) and retirement communities \u2014 are areas poised for growing use. \"Manufacturing is about high throughput and high consistency and you can automate the heck out of it without a cobot,\" Beane said. \"We're only just getting started on this capability being useful and used at scale.\" Rodney Brooks is among the robotics experts who has spoken about a world that is getting older and a working population that is not as strong. He wrote in a blog post covering his annual predictions that \"soon the houses of the elderly will be cluttered with too many robots.\" Wall Street analysts are focused on the opportunity presented by a chronic labor shortage, and related changes taking place in a global outsourcing paradigm which economies including the U.S. have been relying on for decades. With \"near shoring\" and onshoring of more manufacturing activity, there is increasing demand for labor in a tight labor market. One answer is automation, and technology like Universal Robots is relatively easy to program and implement. But one big issue the cobots have not yet solved is the same one that started Brooks down the Rethink path: figuring out what everyone wants from this technology, the \"killer app,\" so to speak, for the cobot. Universal Robots has many different applications for its technology, but not a single one that drives strong demand within one very high volume market. That's a solvable problem, but still a work in progress. Robots running popcorn stations in a movie theatre or robot cafe baristas aren't the career opportunity that takes the cobots to center stage in the economy. But there is a shortage of people and automation has to be one of the solutions, even if it doesn't happen by tomorrow. We have not reached a world of genuine physical collaboration between human worker and cobot, Beane says, \"the kind of stuff where humans reach over to grab the next thing and the robot sees I am reaching and hands it to me and we might even brush up against each other,\" but, \"We are getting there,\" he added. The automated systems that are most widely deployed remain the ones that are more dangerous and kept at a distance. But Beane thinks that Rethink came closer to solving the problem than it is given credit for, and has yet to prove in its new life under Hahn. Hahn did not respond to a request for comment by press time. \"Another eight months and maybe they might have gotten product-market fit. It was inexpensive and reliable. I really do believe we could have seen an iPhone moment,\" Beane said. In his personal blog, Brooks summed up the Rethink story this way: \"Baxter and Sawyer were the first safe robots that did not require a cage to keep humans away from them for the humans' protection. And Sawyer was the first modern industrial robot which finally got away from having a computer-like language to control it, as all robots had since the idea was first developed at the Stanford AI Lab back in the very early seventies. There is still a lot remaining to be done.\""},

Thursday's announcement follows the largest climate funding package in U.S. history, which President Joe Biden signed into law in August. The package includes incentives to jump-start domestic supply chains for electric vehicle batteries, although Piedmont said plans for the plant were in development prior to the Inflation Reduction Act. Now that the company has selected the site in McMinn County, it will begin the process of securing the necessary permits, which can be lengthy. Still, the company is targeting construction beginning in 2023, with production starting in 2025. When fully operational, the plant will produce 30,000 metric tons of lithium per year, making it the largest lithium refining facility in the U.S, according to the company. Piedmont said it will churn out enough material to supply roughly 500,000 electric vehicles annually. Piedmont currently has no active mines in the U.S., so once the facility is up and running it will process spodumene concentrate from Piedmont's international operations in Quebec and Ghana. Eventually, the company hopes to use lithium that's mined domestically. The company has plans for a mine as well as another plant in North Carolina, although CEO Keith Phillips said it's challenging from a permitting perspective, since both the mine and the plant are on the same site. Albemarle runs the only meaningful lithium mine in the U.S., which is in Silver Peak, Nevada. Additionally, only 2.1% of lithium is refined in the U.S., according to data from Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. China dominates the industry, refining more than half of global lithium supply. Should Piedmont's North Carolina mine and plant secure the required permits, however, the company forecasts its lithium output doubling, with the company supplying 1 million electric vehicles per year. Piedmont Lithium's announcement also comes as automakers are rushing toward vast electric vehicle fleets. By some forecasts, there simply won't be enough lithium to meet demand in the foreseeable future. The International Energy Agency estimates that in order to meet the goals set forth in the Paris Agreement, lithium demand will grow by over 40 times by 2040. Building new mines takes years. They're capital intensive and can face permitting challenges. There are also those opposed to new mines, who argue that the world should instead focus on existing production. Piedmont's Phillips noted that in just the last year $33 billion has been announced for electric vehicle battery manufacturing plants in the U.S., which would require 500,000 metric tons of lithium annually. \"That is more than all the lithium hydroxide produced in the world currently, so clearly the industry is facing a critical resource shortage,\" he told CNBC. \"Anyone who can produce material to supply this market \u2014 especially domestically in the United States \u2014 will be in a favored position.\" Piedmont plans to invest around $600 million developing the Tennessee facility."},

The e-commerce platform is warning merchants who try to install Amazon's \"Buy With Prime\" button on their storefront that it violates Shopify's terms of service, and is also raising the specter of security risks, according to research firm Marketplace Pulse. Amazon introduced Buy With Prime in April, pitching it as a way for merchants to grow traffic on their own websites. The service lets merchants add the Prime logo and offer Amazon's speedy delivery options on their sites. Members of the retail giant's Prime loyalty club can check out using their Amazon account. Shopify will not protect merchants who try to use Buy With Prime against fraudulent orders, according to a screenshot of a notice Shopify sent to merchants. The notice also warns that Amazon's service could steal customer data, and charge customers incorrectly. Shopify's terms of service require merchants to use Shopify Checkout \"for any sales associated with your online store.\" Merchants can use checkout integrations that are part of Shopify's payments platform. In order to be part of the payments platform, providers have to agree to Shopify's Partnership Program Agreement and API terms. Buy With Prime competes directly with Shopify's instant checkout and payment service, Shop Pay. Shopify has sought to expand the feature beyond its own platform, striking deals with Facebook and Google last year to let customers use the system to make purchases. Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke welcomed the launch of Buy With Prime at the time of Amazon's announcement, saying the company was \"happy\" to integrate the feature into its platform. \"This fits perfectly into our world view,\" Lutke told investors on the company's first-quarter earnings call. \"And it's not nearly as zero-sum as some people make it out to be.\" Privately, Shopify may not have been as pleased about Buy With Prime. The Information reported in May that the launch sparked internal debate about whether Shopify should integrate the feature on its site. Additionally, a Shopify spokesperson told the publication that Lutke's comments only represented his opinion, adding that the company needed to gather more details before ruling on the issue. A Shopify spokesperson told CNBC in a statement: \"Shopify believes it's a good thing when a company like Amazon opens their infrastructure to more independent businesses to succeed in commerce.\" Shopify has become a popular alternative for sellers who are looking to sell products online, or diversify beyond Amazon. The Canadian company got its start providing businesses with software to help them build a presence online. Shopify in May acquired third-party fulfillment service Deliverr, putting it more directly in competition with Amazon's logistics arm. In response to Shopify's claims that Buy With Prime is insecure, an Amazon spokesperson said: \"We protect information collected via Buy with Prime, including shopper data, in accordance with Amazon's high security standards. We use this information to provide and improve Buy with Prime for merchants and shoppers.\" \"We use Amazon Pay to process payments for Buy with Prime orders. Amazon Pay is backed by the fraud protection technology used on Amazon.com,\" they added. \"Merchants have complete control over the prices customers are charged.\" Shopify said its terms of service are intended to protect merchants, and violations may trigger a warning.

Now, the cryptocurrency trading platform is going after Melbourne-based Thevamanogari Manivel and her sister, Thilagavathy Gangadory, to retrieve its money \u2014 along with 10% interest and legal fees. Court documents show that in May 2021 an employee for the Singapore-based trading platform mistakenly entered an account number into the payment amount field. Crypto.com realized it had accidentally sent Manivel millions of dollars in December 2021 when it was conducting a routine audit. Manivel spent about AU$1.35 million of the accidental windfall on a property, according to the filing. While cryptocurrency transactions are not reversible, centralized platforms can theoretically reverse payments in cases of fraud or error. But in this instance, the company did not discover the error until seven months later, after some of the money had allegedly been moved or spent. The company convinced authorities to freeze Manivel's bank account in February, but she had already transferred the money to other defendants named in the case, according to the filing. The judge ruled in Crypto.com's favor, and the case returns to court in October where a judge will determine next steps in the case. The suit comes at a difficult time for the platform. In June, the company laid off 260 employees, or 5% of its workforce, and has reportedly gone through a second round of aggressive cuts, as crypto firms across the board look for ways to cut costs with investors rotating out of the riskiest assets, pulling down trading volumes. Bitcoin and ether are both down by more than 58% this year, while the wider crypto market has fallen below $1 trillion, down from $3 trillion at its peak in Nov. 2021.

The lawsuit, filed on Wednesday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, comes at a critical time for Arm as its owner Softbank hopes to soon list the firm on public markets after a deal to sell it to Nvidia fell through because of regulatory scrutiny. But the suit also threatens Qualcomm's expansion plans, as it was hoping to use Nuvia processor designs at the heart of the dispute to compete more directly with Apple's chips for iPhones and Macs, and possibly use them to crack the server chip market, a lucrative space dominated by Intel and AMD. Nuvia was founded by ex-Apple chip designers and Qualcomm spent $1.4 billion to acquire it in 2021. Qualcomm's current Snapdragon chips for smartphones are also based on Arm technology. Arm is seeking damages and to force Qualcomm to destroy information and hardware from the Nuvia acquisition including chips, dies, packaging and promotional materials. The dispute centers around the rights to develop a chip using Arm's instruction set architecture (ISA), a core piece of intellectual property with origins dating back to 1985 that outlines how a chip performs basic functions like accessing memory or basic arithmetic. Arm-based chips have been ascendant in recent years because they're more power-efficient than the x86-based chips made by Intel and AMD. Over 29 billion chips based on Arm technology were shipped in 2021, including the chips at the heart of Apple's iPhones, Macs and iPads. Some companies, like Apple, license the ISA from Arm, then design their own physical processor circuits to implement the ISA instructions. Other companies, like Qualcomm historically, also buy the rights to full core designs from Arm, marketed as Cortex. Arm reported $2.7 billion in sales from licensing and royalties in 2021. The suit highlights the tension between Arm's business licensing the underlying intellectual property to make processors that could compete with the company's own designs. Arm said last year that it considered Qualcomm to be a competitor and that architectural licenses pose a threat to its implementation business. Lawsuits over intellectual property and contracts in the semiconductor industry are common. But the Arm-Qualcomm lawsuit is a significant conflict over the ability to design the kind of chip at the heart of nearly every smartphone in the world. It could have significant ramifications for chip startups and could open up a path to adoption for open-source alternatives to Arm. Qualcomm general counsel Ann Chaplin said in a statement that the dispute was a departure from a \"longstanding, successful relationship.\" \"Arm has no right, contractual or otherwise, to attempt to interfere with Qualcomm's or NUVIA's innovations,\" Chaplin said. \"Arm's complaint ignores the fact that Qualcomm has broad, well-established license rights covering its custom-designed CPUs, and we are confident those rights will be affirmed.\" Meanwhile, Arm said in a statement that the company was \"left with no choice other than to bring this claim against Qualcomm and Nuvia to protect our IP, our business, and to ensure customers are able to access valid Arm-based products.\" Qualcomm bought Nuvia because it wanted its chips to have better performance than what it could do with an off-the-shelf Arm processor design, especially to compete with Apple's high-efficiency custom Arm cores. Nuvia, a startup founded by former Apple and Google engineers, was developing a server chip with custom cores under an architecture license. It also had access to Arm's core designs. After the acquisition, Qualcomm placed Nuvia at the heart of its smartphone and PC strategy, using the startup's cores to make its laptop processors more competitive with Apple's M-series chips in products launching as soon as 2023. Qualcomm was also pitching Nuvia-based cloud processors to cloud providers such as Amazon, according to Bloomberg News. Arm says in its lawsuit that Nuvia's architectural license didn't transfer to Qualcomm when it bought it. Qualcomm has an architectural license, Arm says, but needed Arm's consent to purchase and use Nuvia's custom core designs. Arm terminated its Nuvia licenses in March, it said. If that holds in court, Qualcomm's entire chip strategy could be in flux. There may be an alternative route, however. Karl Freund, founder and analyst at Cambrian AI Research, speculated that Qualcomm could try to use RISC-V, an open source alternative to Arm's instruction set. Arm told regulators in December that \"RISC-V's momentum is accelerating\" and that established vendors are increasingly using it instead of Arm's instruction set. A few startups are currently building CPU cores based on RISC-V, but it has yet to be used in high-volume smartphones, which all currently use Arm. Arm's efforts to enforce its intellectual property with long-term partners, however, will likely prompt companies building custom Arm cores to take another look at open-source alternatives."},

In April, more than 2,600 workers at Amazon's warehouse in Staten Island, known as JFK8, voted to join the Amazon Labor Union, becoming the first group to vote in favor of unionizing at one of the e-commerce giant's U.S. facilities. Amazon in May sought to overturn the results of the election. It submitted a filing to the NLRB accusing the federal agency's Brooklyn office of violating labor law by appearing to support the union drive. Amazon, which included 25 objections in its filing, also alleged that labor organizers intimidated workers to vote in their favor. Amazon's objections kicked off 24 days of hearings held via Zoom where lawyers for the company, NLRB's Region 29 office, and the ALU dissected conduct during the election. JFK8 workers and union organizers, including Chris Smalls, co-founder and interim president of the ALU, were among the more than a dozen witnesses called to testify. Lisa Dunn, the NLRB attorney presiding over the hearing, concluded in a filing Thursday that Amazon \"had not met its burden\" of establishing the agency, the union or any other parties \"engaged in objectionable conduct affecting the results of the election,\" NLRB spokesperson Kayla Blado said. Dunn also recommended ALU be certified as bargaining representative, Blado said. Amazon has until Sept. 16 to file objections to Dunn's recommendations, which will then be heard by a regional director of the NLRB. The regional director will determine whether to order a new union election, or certify the results of the April election, at which point Amazon will be required to start contract negotiations with the ALU. The union said in a statement that it's pleased with the hearing officer's recommendations. \"It is our hope that the Regional Director for Region 28 can expedite our certification and that the NLRB enforces Amazon's legal obligation to negotiate with the workers of the ALU,\" the union said in a release posted to Twitter. Representatives from Amazon and the NLRB didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The ALU, a grassroots organization of current and former Amazon employees, has sought to expand its reach beyond JFK8. The union in May failed to replicate its successful union campaign at another Staten Island warehouse, but it has gained traction elsewhere. Workers at an Amazon warehouse near Albany are seeking to be represented by the ALU. The NLRB has yet to set a date for that election. A Kentucky Amazon warehouse has also expressed interest in organizing under ALU. WATCH: How two friends formed Amazon's first U.S. union and what's next"},

The agency claims Kochava violated a section of the FTC Act that prohibits unfair deceptive practices in commerce. Using data Kochava collected on mobile devices and combining it with public map programs, the FTC found it was possible to infer the identity of the device owner by linking those devices to sensitive locations and tracing them back to single-family homes. The agency claimed that until at least June of this year, Kochava would grant users access to a sample data set of time-stamped location information from 61 million unique mobile devices, with relatively little effort required by the user seeking access to the data. The FTC claims Kochava was aware of this potential use, marketing its services on the Amazon Web Services Marketplace with the suggestion of using its information \"to map individual devices to households.\" The agency argues in its complaint filed in federal court in Idaho that identification via Kochava's location data \"is likely to injure consumers through exposure to stigma, discrimination, physical violence, emotional distress, and other harms.\" It added that Kochava could have installed reasonable safeguards to protect consumer information, like by blacklisting information associated with sensitive locations so that it would not appear in data sets, such as addiction recovery centers, shelters or medical facilities. \"This lawsuit shows the unfortunate reality that the FTC has a fundamental misunderstanding of Kochava's data marketplace business and other data businesses,\" Kochava Collective General Manager Brian Cox said in a statement. \"Kochava operates consistently and proactively in compliance with all rules and laws, including those specific to privacy.\" Cox said the company announced a new ability to block location data from sensitive locations prior to the FTC's lawsuit. He said the company engaged with the FTC for weeks explaining the data collection process and hoped to come up with \"effective solutions\" with the agency. \"Unfortunately the only outcome the FTC desired was a settlement that had no clear terms or resolutions and redefined the problem into a moving target,\" Cox said. \"Real progress to improve data privacy for consumers will not be reached through flamboyant press releases and frivolous litigation. It's disappointing that the agency continues to circumvent the lawmaking process and perpetuate misinformation surrounding data privacy.\" The FTC voted 4-1 to bring the lawsuit, with Republican Commissioner Noah Joshua Phillips voting against filing the complaint. The commission's other Republican, Christine Wilson, voted with the Democratic majority. The lawsuit builds on the agency's focus on privacy, after announcing earlier this month it is exploring new rules to crack down on commercial surveillance and lax data security.

{"url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/29/apple-iphone-14-event-preview-september-2022.html", "title": "Expect Apple to show four new iPhones and an updated Apple Watch next week", "tag": "Tech", "author": "Kif Leswing", "datetime": "2022-08-29 18:11:43", "paragraphs": " Apple is holding a launch event at its headquarters in Cupertino, California, on Sept. 7. The company is expected to announce new iPhone models, as it has every September since 2012. Apple has used prerecorded videos for its launch events since early 2020 thanks partly to Covid restrictions, and this will be the first iPhone launch with an in-person component since 2019. Apple is streaming the launch event online on its website and YouTube in addition to inviting some media to its campus. Apple's hype-filled fall launches are a signature event for Apple. They typically draw millions of simultaneous viewers on YouTube. They garner attention from around the world and set the stage for a holiday marketing blitz during the last three months of the year, which is when Apple's sales are the highest. This year's event has the tagline \"far out,\" which could refer to features such as night-sky photography. Last year, Apple released new iPhones and Apple Watches at an event in September, and then followed it up with an October launch featuring iPads and Macs. Here's what Apple is likely to launch next Wednesday, based on reports. Apple is expected to release four new iPhone models. If Apple's current naming convention holds up, they will be called the iPhone 14. This year Apple will likely discontinue the \"mini\" model with a 4.7-inch screen, according to reports. Instead, Apple could offer two sizes, one with a 6.1-inch screen and one with a 6.7-inch screen, each coming in a standard model and a pricier \"Pro\" model. The Pro models are expected to get more upgrades, according to reports from Bloomberg News, TFI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, and other analysts and Apple watchers. Since 2017, iPhones have included a space at the top of the phone's display with space for Apple's FaceID system, which includes several sensors and a camera. The Pro models could ditch Apple's \"notch\" where it houses the FaceID camera for a slimmer, more streamlined \"pill\" or \"cutout\" approach with a smaller space that has to remain blank, leaving room for an even larger display. The Pro models are also expected to get upgraded A16 processors and cameras. The camera bump is expected to get larger. Apple could release an always-on screen display for showing notifications, like some Android phones have sported for years. Beta iPhone software released over the summer suggested that Apple may be planning a similar feature because of new widgets that show weather and battery life. One of the biggest questions is how Apple will price its iPhones in a period of inflation around the world and macroeconomic uncertainty in some regions. Other consumer electronics, such as Sony's Playstation 5, have seen price cuts. Apple's least-expensive iPhone 13 model is the $699 iPhone 13 Mini, which is expected to be discontinued. That would make Apple's mainline device, which is currently the iPhone 13, the least-expensive new model at $829, if its price doesn't change. Some analysts also expect Apple to increase the price of its Pro models. Apple usually drops the price of older models when it releases new ones, giving more price-sensitive consumers an option. Apple is likely to show the eighth major new version of its watch next week. Last year, the Apple Watch Series 7 got a slightly larger screen, but the redesign did not significantly change the look and feel of the device, which has remained mostly the same since 2014. Expect more evolution this year, too. Apple is considering a body temperature sensor in the new devices, according to the Wall Street Journal, which could help with fertility and sleep tracking. Other sleep tracking features could include the ability to detect advanced sleep patterns or apnea. But the biggest Apple Watch Series 8 announcement could be a new \"Pro\" model with a bigger screen and more durable finish. Apple has previously released Apple Watches with pricey case materials such as gold, ceramic and titanium, and the new \"Pro\" model described by Bloomberg and Kuo could be one of the first high-end Apple Watches to gain additional features over its less-expensive siblings. Also likely: A new updated version of the Apple Watch SE, its $329 entry-level Watch model. IPhone owners who don't plan to buy any new gear this fall will still get an annual update to the iPhones software, iOS 16, which was announced in June and has been in testing over the summer. The software has several new features that users will immediately notice. The biggest banner feature is the ability to customize the iPhone's lock screen with widgets that can display weather forecasts, calendar appointments and other information at a glance. Users can also change the font for the lock screen clock for the first time, as well. IOS 16 also lets you unsend or edit iMessage text messages, as long as you catch them within a few minutes of sending. IOS 16 will also introduce short-term loans from Apple called Apple Pay Later. The feature will allow users to buy stuff online with Apple Pay but pay for the item in four installments without paying interest. One cool feature in iOS 16 is if a user has both an iPhone and a Mac laptop or desktop, they can use the iPhone as a very high-definition web camera. Apple is unlikely to release new iPads next week because their software isn't ready yet. Earlier this month, Apple told TechCrunch that iPadOS, the iPad software, will ship after iOS this fall, suggesting a staggered release. Apple's statement was terse, and the company dislikes talking about unannounced products. But in general, it likes to release new hardware together with new software, so the statement clearly suggested that new iPads would come at a later launch date than iPhones. IPadOS and iOS are very similar, but this year iPadOS is getting a feature called Stage Manager that could allow users to multitask more efficiently \u2014 but also got panned by early testers. Improved iPads could include more powerful processors that are closers to laptop processors, smoother displays and better integration with accessories. Apple also uncharacteristically teased a new \"Mac Pro\" in the spring. The Mac Pro is currently a $5,000 tower of power using an Intel processor. Apple wants to transition its entire Mac lineup away from Intel to its own M-series processors, but a pricey niche product doesn't fit as well with Apple's mass-market iPhones and Apple Watches. Instead, new Macs could be announced at a separate event later this year, as happened last year."},

Chipmaker Nvidia's shares have plunged around 13% this week after the company disclosed new U.S. restrictions on its exports to China, affecting about $400 million in potential sales in the current quarter. In China, the Nvidia Drive Orin chip has become a core part of electric automakers' assisted driving tech. These semi-autonomous driving systems are an important selling point for the companies in what has become a fiercely competitive market in China. Some automakers are also using Nvidia's Xavier chip. Automotive is a relatively small but fast-growing part of Nvidia's business. However, the new U.S. restrictions target Nvidia's A100 and H100 products \u2014 and these chips' sales are part of the company's far larger data center business. The products are graphics processors that can be used for artificial intelligence. \"There shouldn't be any restrictions on Xavier and Orin, and Xpeng, Nio and others would continue to ship with those chips,\" said Bevin Jacob, partner at Shanghai-based investment and consulting firm Automobility. Jacob, however, did warn that there could be \"close scrutiny\" in the future on U.S. firms shipping chips relating to artificial intelligence and autonomous driving to China. Xpeng declined to comment. Nio, Li Auto, Huawei and Jidu \u2014 a new electric vehicle brand backed by Baidu and Geely \u2014 did not respond to requests for comment. The new U.S. rules are designed to reduce the risk of supporting the Chinese military, according to the U.S. government, Nvidia said in its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday. But it's unclear what prompted this specific policy move or what could drive future ones. In another positive sign for the chipmaker, the U.S. will allow Nvidia to continue developing its H100 artificial intelligence chip in China, the company said Thursday. \"The U.S. government has authorized exports, reexports, and in-country transfers needed to continue NVIDIA Corporation's, or the Company's, development of H100 integrated circuits,\" Nvidia said in a filing Thursday. The company said second-quarter revenue for its automotive business was $220 million, up 45% from a year earlier. \"Our automotive revenue is inflecting, and we expect it to be our next billion-dollar business,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in an earnings call in late August, according to a StreetAccount transcript. WeRide, an autonomous driving technology start-up, said in a statement that \"there is no immediate impact from the ban.\" \"We believe both the supply and demand side in the industry will work closely together to handle the constantly changing business environment to safeguard the continuous development of technology,\" the company said in a statement to CNBC. Pony.ai, another autonomous driving start-up, said it is not affected, as did automaker Geely. \u2014 CNBC's Kif Leswing contributed to this report."},

The website called Temu, which went online Thursday, lists items across a number of categories including clothing, jewelry, pet supplies and home and garden, and could mark a new challenge to U.S. e-commerce leader Amazon. Pinduoduo did not respond to a request for comment when contacted by CNBC. Temu marks Pinduoduo's biggest push overseas yet as the domestic Chinese economy faces a number of challenges from a resurgence of Covid-19 to an energy crunch. That has hurt economic growth in China and dampened consumer sentiment. China's biggest technology companies from Tencent to Pinduoduo's e-commerce rivals Alibaba and JD.com continue to pursue international markets. Pinduoduo, a much younger company than Alibaba and JD.com, having only been founded in 2015, is behind its rivals when it comes to the overseas push. Alibaba took a controlling stake in Singapore-based Southeast Asian e-commerce site Lazada in 2016 and has since invested money in the business to expand its presence in the region. Alibaba also has a separate website called AliExpress that services markets like Europe and the U.S. JD.com meanwhile operates Joybuy.com for international customers. Pinduoduo's Temu is a cross-border e-commerce website with most products likely to come from overseas, especially China. Temu said shipping to the U.S. could take 7-15 business days. \"It's important to keep in mind that you may see longer delivery times than you're used to from other e-commerce websites. This is due to the fact that items that may be coming from another country or need to be bundled or packaged with other similar-sized items,\" the website says on the shipping information page. Shipping is free for orders over $49. Pinduoduo could face some challenges in cracking the U.S. market. First it will need to build brand reputation versus the likes of Amazon. And it could also suffer from its relatively long shipping times versus the same-day or next-day deliveries Amazon offers via its Prime subscription services. Temu's \"main challenges will be cultivating trust and awareness among customers,\" Jacob Cooke, CEO of WPIC, an e-commerce tech and marketing firm that helps foreign brands sell in China, told CNBC. There are currently also some categories that have very few products. For example, the men's wristwatch category had just two products listed. However, Temu could compete on price. On Thursday, Temu had a 20% discount offer sitewide. And products appear to be quite cheap. For example, the women's dresses listed were mostly under $20. Temu could also have an advantage due to \"existing relationships with low-cost manufacturers in China that maybe haven't expanded to the U.S. yet,\" Cooke said. Pinduoduo has grown quickly in its seven-year history to become one of China's biggest e-commerce firms. The company has tended to focus on lower-income consumers by offering heavily discounted products. And it has been focusing on bringing agricultural products onto its platform to differentiate from rivals. The company is worth around $87 billion."},

It's a win for the company after it warned Wednesday that new export restrictions could hamper its operations in the country. Nvidia said in an SEC filing Wednesday that the U.S. government is restricting sales of high-performance AI chips for servers, the A100 and H100, to China and Russia. Sales of both chips are still restricted in those markets, though it can still develop the H100 in China. Nvidia expects a $400 million hit to revenue in the current quarter from new export restrictions. The company's stock fell nearly 9% in trading Thursday. \"The U.S. government has authorized exports, reexports, and in-country transfers needed to continue NVIDIA Corporation's, or the Company's, development of H100 integrated circuits,\" Nvidia said in a filing Thursday. The Biden administration is working to limit U.S. exports of certain semiconductors and equipment because of fears that Chinese companies could use them for military purposes. Graphics processors like the kind that Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices make are well suited for artificial intelligence applications that could include weapons development, facial recognition and other military uses. The H100 is Nvidia's upcoming enterprise AI chip that was previously expected to ship by the end of the year. Part of its development takes place in China. The A100 is an older model that has been shipping for three years. They are both graphics processors that can be used for supercomputing and artificial intelligence. Nvidia's data center business, which includes sales of the A100 and H100, is one of the fastest-growing parts of the company, reporting $3.8 billion in sales in the June quarter, a 61% annual increase. However, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang warned analysts in August that Chinese cloud companies were slowing down building out their data centers and that China was a \"very large market\" for the company. Nvidia said Thursday that it can continue to ship AI chips from its Hong Kong facility through September 2023. \"The Chinese hyperscalers and the Chinese Internet companies really, really slowed down infrastructure investment this year, particularly starting in -- they've been rather slow in building out and really accelerate -- well, really slowed down in Q2,\" Huang said. Some analysts believe that Nvidia can ameliorate the impact of the new export restrictions by working with the government, although it's unclear whether the Chinese government might retaliate with its own bans. \"While there are potential near and intermediate term risks from the export ban, Nvidia is working closely with the [U.S. government] to navigate through the situation and we believe the USG is fully aware of the critical/strategic importance of Nvidia's accelerated compute platform to the global tech industry,\" JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur wrote in a note Thursday. The Department of Commerce said the new export restrictions are related to national security, but it didn't answer follow-up questions about whether it clarified or changed the policy for Nvidia. \"While we are not in a position to outline specific policy changes at this time, we are taking a comprehensive approach to implement additional actions necessary related to technologies, end-uses, and end-users to protect U.S. national security and foreign policy interests,\" a Department of Commerce representative said Wednesday. AMD also said Wednesday that it received new license requirements from the Department of Commerce, but did not expect them to materially affect its business because of lower China exposure. Shares of AMD fell more than 4% during trading Thursday."},

According to a report from market research firm Streamlabs, in the second quarter of 2022 Facebook Gaming accounted for only 7.9% of the market share for amount of hours watched, behind Twitch (76.7%) and YouTube (15.4%). Facebook isn't the first internet giant to have tried and failed at recreating the Twitch formula. In 2020, Microsoft shuttered its own streaming service, Mixer, after signing a multimillion dollar to have the famous Fortnite player Tyler \"Ninja\" Blevins stream on its service exclusively. YouTube, Twitch's closest competitor, has found more success chipping away at Twitch's dominance.

On Friday, the company launched the mid-range Honor 70 smartphone in Europe and said an unannounced foldable phone will be coming to the region and other international markets too in the future. It will be the first time Honor launches a foldable device overseas, the company said. Honor faces an uphill battle outside of China where it has less than a 1% smartphone market share. The brand was sold by Huawei to a consortium of Chinese buyers in late 2020 as a way to survive U.S. sanctions. In 2019 and 2020, Huawei was hit by a number of American sanctions that cut its access to Google software and key chips, destroying its smartphone business. Since then, Honor has launched a number of smartphones. This year, it brought its flagship Magic 4 handset to international markets. Alongside the upcoming foldable phone, Honor is placing emphasis on the more expensive premium end of the smartphone market outside of China. That will put Honor in competition with Samsung's latest foldables \u2014 the Galaxy Z Flip 4 and Galaxy Z Fold 4. \"As the global economy has deteriorated in 2022, the premium end has remained strong, benefitting Samsung and Apple so far this year,\" James Manning Smith, senior analyst at CCS Insight, told CNBC via email. \"One of Honor's greatest challenges in the year will be trying to leverage this trend, attempting to win sales from well-established premium brands, particularly in a year where stretched budgets will result in consumers looking to avoid potentially more risky purchases.\" Shipments of phones costing over $1,000 grew 94% year-on-year in the second quarter, according to Counterpoint Research. This segment is dominated by Apple and Samsung. But Honor's Chinese rivals including Xiaomi, Oppo and Realme have also managed to gain share overseas by managing to pump out mid-priced devices with high specs. That will pose another challenge to Honor. Honor's \"low-cost Chinese peers have made some serious in-roads in the European market over the last two years, a position that they will not give up without a fight,\" Smith added. \"Although Honor has been ramping up its marketing, it faces some incredibly fierce competition outside of China.\""},

Some 220 solar panels and other equipment at the facility, known as FAT1, were damaged by the three-alarm fire, which was caused by \"an undetermined electrical event within the solar system mounted on top of the roof,\" Leland Wilding, Fresno's fire investigator, wrote in an incident report. A little over a year later, about 60 firefighters were called to an even larger Amazon facility in Perryville, Maryland, to put out a two-alarm blaze, local news outlets reported. In the intervening months, at least four other Amazon fulfillment centers caught fire or experienced electrical explosions due to failures with their solar energy-generating systems, according to internal company documents viewed by CNBC. The documents, which have never been made public, indicate that between April 2020 and June 2021, Amazon experienced \"critical fire or arc flash events\" in at least six of its 47 North American sites with solar installations, affecting 12.7% of such facilities. Arc flashes are a kind of electrical explosion. \"The rate of dangerous incidents is unacceptable, and above industry averages,\" an Amazon employee wrote in one of the internal reports. The solar snafus underscore the challenge Amazon and many other large corporations face in their quest to shrink their environmental footprint and reduce reliance on fossil fuels. Amazon has been among the most aggressive. In 2019, founder Jeff Bezos launched the Climate Pledge, promising the largest online retailer would zero out emissions by 2040, embrace renewable energy and move away from gas-guzzling delivery vans, including through a billion-dollar-plus investment in electric vehicle company Rivian. Corporate America is under pressure from regulators and a growing subset of investors to set and report on environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals. Many will be able to reap financial rewards for renewable energy efforts after Congress in August passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which includes climate provisions projected to reduce the country's carbon emissions by roughly 40% by 2030. Commercial solar in the U.S. is expected to see 8% annual growth over the next five years, thanks in part to the legislation, according to Wood Mackenzie solar analyst Michelle Davis. Warehouses can take outsized advantage of solar, she said, because they have large roofs and the systems can power all the HVAC, refrigeration and other energy-heavy systems located inside. But costly and dangerous issues can arise. By June of last year, all of Amazon's U.S. operations with solar had to be taken offline temporarily, internal documents show. The company had to ensure its systems were designed, installed and maintained properly before \"re-energizing\" any of them. Amazon spokesperson Erika Howard told CNBC in a statement that the incidents involved systems run by partners, and that the company responded by voluntarily turning off its solar-powered roofs. \"Out of an abundance of caution, following a small number of isolated incidents with onsite solar systems owned and operated by third parties, Amazon proactively powered off our onsite solar installations in North America, and took immediate steps to re-inspect each installation by a leading solar technical expert firm,\" the statement said. Those details didn't show up in Amazon's 100-page sustainability report for 2021, which was published at the beginning of August. In that report, available to the public via Amazon's sustainability website, the company said rooftop solar was powering 115 of its fulfillment centers across the globe by the end of 2021, up from more than 90 in the middle of the year. The majority of those are outside the U.S. \"Many of our fulfillment facilities throughout the U.S., Europe, and India are powered by on-site solar, where a rooftop installation can power up to 80% of the facility's energy use,\" the report said. By April of this year, Amazon had onsite solar at 176 facilities, according to its website. The solar program was launched in 2017. \"As inspections are completed, our onsite solar systems are being powered back on,\" Howard said. \"Amazon also built a team of dedicated solar experts overseeing the construction, operations, and maintenance of our systems in-house to ensure the safety of our systems.\" Excluded from the public sustainability report is any mention of the expenses Amazon incurs when there's a failure. An Amazon employee estimated, in the documents circulated internally, that each incident cost the company an average of $2.7 million. Costs included third-party audits of rooftop solar systems, checks on how much electricity they were generating and repairs for any broken or faulty parts of the systems that inspectors identified. The Amazon employee also said the company would lose $940,000 per month, or $20,000 for each of the 47 decommissioned North American sites, as long as the solar remained offline. There could be additional costs for Amazon depending on contracts with clean energy partners for renewable energy credits, the documents show. To date, Amazon has contracted with third-party vendors to design, then install solar photovoltaic systems on rooftops and big backup batteries on site. Other major retailers, including Walmart and Target, have also installed solar rooftops and adopted programs to trim their energy bills and reach sustainability goals. In addition to its warehouses, Amazon has some solar roof systems at its Whole Foods stores. Amazon and its auditor, Clean Energy Associates (CEA), put off inspection of the solar rooftop systems at Whole Foods locations until 2022, the documents said. As of late 2021, four years after acquiring Whole Foods, Amazon was still working to attain technical information about the renewable energy assets at the stores. To maintain tighter quality control of its solar energy systems, some Amazon employees recommended bringing more operations in-house. The fire in Perryville, Maryland, which was the sixth failure in a little over a year, spurred the company to take systematic action. On June 17, 2021, roughly a week after the fire at the warehouse known as MDT2, Amazon's sustainability division directed the owners and developers of solar rooftop systems on its U.S. warehouses to decommission them. The solar rooftops would no longer be generating electricity from the sun or producing renewable energy credits. Amazon then hired Denver-based CEA to conduct a third-party audit of its rooftop solar systems in the U.S., Asia-Pacific and Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Late last year, while CEA was still conducting its inspections, it informed Amazon of one critical and 259 major findings across Amazon's rooftop solar portfolio. Problems included mismatched module-to-module connectors, improper installation of connectors, poor wire management and evidence of water intrusion in the inverters, internal documents said. Issues with inverters, which convert solar energy into usable electricity, were identified as the likely cause of a fire in at least one Amazon warehouse. Wilding, the Fresno fire inspector, concluded the blaze at FAT1 \"originated on or near two inverters,\" according to an investigation report obtained by CNBC through a request for public records. Amazon blamed third-party partners and vendors for the most significant problems uncovered by CEA and other teams working on facilities and sustainability initiatives. \"Over the past five years, solar malfunctions have been caused by improper installation techniques, improper commissioning of a new system, inadequate system maintenance and equipment malfunction,\" the documents said. Amazon teams working on facilities and sustainability initiatives devised a two-part plan to help prevent future breakdowns in the rooftop solar program. In late 2021, the divisions requested $3.6 million in funding to reinspect sites where major findings were identified in order to ensure the systems were safe to be brought back online, according to internal correspondence. Internal teams also began to urge Amazon leadership to rely more on salaried employees and less on outside vendors. Over time, the company hired more solar experts focused on procurement, design, construction and maintenance globally. In some cases, management was notably slow in responding. For example, the groups inside the company agitating for change went to leadership for approval on the hiring, re-inspection and re-energizing plans. But the efforts were held up for months by top Amazon executives, including Kara Hurst, vice president of worldwide sustainability, and Alicia Boler-Davis, senior vice president of global customer fulfillment, who left the company in June 2022, according to internal correspondence viewed by CNBC. Amazon disputed the claim in the documents that leadership was slow to address employee requests. Job openings suggest Amazon is still seeking to hire people internally for solar operations. The company was recently looking for someone to manage sustainability projects across its North American facilities, which include rooftop solar. There's a current listing for a technical program partner on the solar team says that a key aspect of the position is collaborating with \"internal partners\" in worldwide design, solar construction and sustainability, among other divisions. As it tries to staff up, Amazon has acknowledged that going green comes with hurdles, particularly for a company \"of the size and broad scope of Amazon.\" \"But at Amazon, we don't shy away from big challenges,\" Hurst wrote, in the letter kicking off the 2021 sustainability report. \"We don't have all the answers today, but we believe in the need to act now.\" WATCH: How two friends formed Amazon's first U.S. union and what's next"},

But that didn't stop the state of Mississippi from paying Favre $1.1 million in 2017 and 2018 to make motivational speeches \u2014 out of federal welfare funds intended for needy families. The Mississippi state auditor said Favre never gave the speeches and demanded the money back, with interest. Favre has repaid the fees, although not the $228,000 in interest the auditor also demanded. But the revelation by the auditor that $70 million in TANF welfare funds was doled out to a multimillionaire athlete, a professional wrestler, a horse farm and a volleyball complex are at the heart of a scandal that has rocked the nation's poorest state, sparking parallel state and federal criminal investigations that have led to charges and guilty pleas involving some of the key players. Favre hasn't been accused of a crime or charged, and he declined an interview. His lawyer, Bud Holmes, said he did nothing wrong and never understood he was paid with money intended to help poor children. Holmes acknowledged that Favre had been questioned by the FBI in the case, a fact that hasn't previously been reported. The saga, which has been boiling at low grade for 2\u00bd years, drew new attention in July, when the state welfare agency fired a lawyer who had been hired to claw back some of the money, just after he issued a subpoena seeking more information about the roles of Favre and the former governor, Phil Bryant, a Republican. The current governor, Republican Tate Reeves, acknowledged playing a role in the decision to sack Brad Pigott, accusing the former Bill Clinton-appointed U.S. attorney of having a political agenda. But the state official who first uncovered the misspending and fraud, auditor Shad White, is a Republican. In his first television interview since he was fired, Pigott said his only agenda was to get at the truth and to recoup U.S. taxpayer funds sent to Mississippi that he says were \"squandered.\" \"The notion of tens of millions of dollars that was intended by the country to go to the alleviation of poverty \u2014 and to see it going toward very different purposes \u2014 was appalling to many of us,\" he said. \"Mr. Favre was a very great quarterback, but having been a great NFL quarterback, he is not well acquainted with poverty.\" Pigott, who before he was fired sued on behalf of Mississippi's welfare agency, naming Favre and 37 other grant recipients, laid ultimate blame at the feet of top Mississippi politicians, including Bryant. \"Governor Bryant gave tens of millions of dollars of this TANF welfare money to a nonprofit led by a person who he knew well and who had more connections with his political party than with the good people in Mississippi who have the heart and the skills to actually cajole people out of poverty or prevent teenage pregnancies,\" he said. In an interview with Mississippi Today, Bryant said he never knew the grants came from welfare money. His lawyer didn't respond to requests for comment. The person in charge of the nonprofit group Pigott was referring to is Nancy New, a close friend of Bryant's wife. New and her son have pleaded guilty to state and federal charges and agreed to cooperate. New, a key player in doling out the money, said in a court document that Bryant was among those involved in directing the transactions. Her lawyer declined to comment. The former head of the state welfare agency, John Davis, has pleaded not guilty to state charges of bribery and conspiracy, and law enforcement officials say the investigations continue. Favre defended himself in a series of tweets last year against charges from state auditor White that he accepted state money for speeches he never intended to give. \"I would never knowingly take funds meant to help our neighbors in need, but for Shad White to continue to push out this lie that the money was for no-show events is something I cannot stay silent about,\" Favre tweeted. The speeches aren't the only welfare grants tied to Favre. Text messages obtained by the website Mississippi Today and authenticated by Pigott show that Favre sought a $3.2 million grant to a drug company in which he was a shareholder and a $5 million award that built a volleyball arena at the University of Southern Mississippi, where his daughter played the sport and where he played football. Favre's lawyer declined to comment. The drug company, Prevacus, was touting treatments to mitigate the effects of concussions, although none were approved by the Food and Drug Administration. In some texts, Favre suggested awarding shares in the drug company to Bryant while he was governor. \"Don't know if legal or not but we need cut him in,\" Favre texted a company official in November 2018, referring to Bryant. Following up three days later, Favre wrote, \"Also if legal I'll give some of my shares to the Governor.\" Bryant has said he never would have accepted such an offer. \"All of it remains quite a mystery,\" Pigott told NBC News, \"as to why Mr. Favre would get the benefit of millions of dollars in TANF welfare money, both for a fee for speeches he didn't make, $2 million-plus to go to a company in which he was the largest outside individual investor and $5 million for his alma mater to play volleyball in a volleyball building.\" The state auditor said he found other \"no show\" contracts benefiting former pro athletes and family members of Davis, the welfare agency director. The auditor said Davis directed one contract to Austin Smith, his nephew, who was paid more than $400,000 to provide \"coding skills\" classes even though prosecutors allege he had no such skills \"and did not know how to teach.\" At least $3 million went to Ted DiBiase, a retired professional wrestler. Marcus Dupree, a former college football star, also received $370,000 in welfare funds, which prosecutors say partly went to fund his horse ranch. Paul LaCoste, who is the current governor's athletic trainer, was paid $300,000 in welfare funds to run a fitness boot camp for legislators. DiBiase, Dupree, LaCoste and Smith didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. The scandal has also spotlighted the meager scope of Mississippi's welfare program and provided a stark reminder of the Clinton-era welfare reform that provided states with block grants and wide latitude in how they spend it. According to state figures, Mississippi rejects more than 90% of those who apply for the federal welfare benefit known as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF. This year 2,500 children received benefits, state officials said, in a state with 192,000 poor children. One of those who had trouble getting help was Tamara Edwards, who raised four children on her own while working a series of low-wage jobs. She once received welfare vouchers for child care, and in 2009 she applied again, she said. Even though her income was low enough, she was denied. \"They told me they didn't have the funds,\" said Edwards, who now works as a cook at a Cracker Barrel restaurant. Advocates and state legislators say Mississippi's welfare agency, under years of conservative Republican state governments, has a history of questionable spending and a lack of transparency. \"TANF has been a slush fund for a long time,\" said Oleta Fitzgerald, who is the director of the Children's Defense Fund's Southern Regional Office and is based in Jackson, the state capital. \"Mississippi is the poorest doggone state in the country \u2014 where is the money, and what are they doing with it? There is nobody on welfare \u2014 welfare participation rates are way down \u2014 and no one knows where that money is being spent.\" Aisha Nyandoro, the chief executive of Springboard to Opportunities, a local nonprofit group that works with residents of affordable housing, said: \"And DHS [the state Department of Human Services] will tell you that the reason that they cannot go about allocating the TANF funds is because they can't find any families who are eligible. Go outside and throw a rock. It's Mississippi. You can find an eligible family.\" Jarvis Dortsch, a former state legislator who heads the state's chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, said that when he was a member of the Legislature, \"I could not get a list of how the money was being spent.\" Dortsch said he had to resort to secrecy. \"Someone had snuck me a list \u2014 it didn't have [a] DHS [logo] on it \u2014 they had it printed out and snuck it out,\" he said. Shad White, the auditor, told NBC News the investigation goes on. \"My office is continuing the work we started over two years ago on what is now the largest public fraud case in our state's history,\" he said. \"We will also continue to work with our state and federal partners to be sure each person responsible for this massive scheme is held fully accountable under the law.\""},

Already reeling from an economic crisis, flood waters have submerged over one third of the country in water, killing over 1,000 and impacting 33 million people. Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, the country's foreign minister, told CNBC's Dan Murphy Thursday that he fears the damages from the natural disaster will exceed current estimates of $10 billion, adding that the crisis in the country is still ongoing and in the \"rescue and relief phase.\" The flooding, which Bhutto Zardari told CNBC is \"a climate disaster of biblical proportions,\" covers over 95,000 square miles of land. Bhutto Zardari said the crisis is far from over, as \"southern areas of Pakistan are still bracing themselves for the flooding to come through the rivers from the north.\" \"Pakistan at this point in time, are paying in their lives and in their livelihoods for a climate disaster that is not of their making,\" he said. Pakistan's contribution to global carbon emissions is less than 1%, but it's among the 10 most affected countries in the world by climate change. The South Asian nation of over 220 million people reported a 27% inflation rate for August, according to government data, and was hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic. Its currency has tanked while net foreign reserves have dwindled to just $8 billion in August, according to the State Bank of Pakistan. Political infighting has gripped the country since April, after the ousting of former Prime Minister Imran Khan, who has been charged under anti-terror laws by Pakistan's police. Rural areas in Pakistan have been hit the hardest by flooding, which will have a compounded impact on Pakistan's farming industry, and ultimately the cost of food. Bhutto Zardari told CNBC \"about 80 to 90%\" of Pakistan's crops have been damaged by the floods. The International Rescue Committee report that 4 million acres of crops have been destroyed with 800,000 livestock perishing. Prior to the disaster, food inflation in rural provinces was much higher compared to urban areas. For instance, the cost of onions in Pakistan's urban areas increased by 89% from July 2021 to July 2022. In rural areas, that cost increase topped 100%. The International Monetary Fund on Monday approved the release of $1.1 billion to Pakistan in special drawing rights, a part of its bailout program which began in 2019. The money was already part of a relief program to help Pakistan stabilize its economy. Pakistan has now launched a joint appeal with the United Nations for about $160 million, which Bhutto Zardari told CNBC \"is obviously a very conservative estimate about the bare minimum requirements at this moment.\" Over a million homes have been destroyed, and Bhutto Zardari added that key infrastructure like bridges, road networks, and dams have been damaged. Pakistan going forward, he says, will need \"large scale reconstruction, which will require a lot of work.\""},

Employees are turning to gadgets to outsmart monitoring software. One such tool is a mouse mover, or mouse jiggler, that's supposed to keep your screen on. I decided to give one a try to see if it works. I learned about mouse jigglers on TikTok. A mouse mover is a device that claims to be undetectable by your computer. As the name indicates, the device simulates mouse movement, preventing your computer from going into sleep mode. So-called \"tattleware,\" or surveillance software is being installed on company-issued devices to track employee screen time, keyboard usage, and clicks. The mouse jiggler may not help with keyboard usage or clicks, but it should address screen time monitoring by keeping your computer's display on. Here's how a mouse jiggler works. I ordered a $30 Vaydeer Mouse Jiggler off Amazon and tested it out for a day. It took less than a minute to set up. You simply plug the power cord into the USB port on your computer, or attach it to the power brick and plug it into the wall. Use the wall for power if you're paranoid. You probably don't want to plug any type of device that helps you avoid work directly into a work-owned computer, especially since USB ports open up a whole host of security concerns, too. There's an orange power button on the left side that you can press to turn it on and off. A turntable moves when it's on. That's where you place the mouse's sensor. Once your mouse is in the right position, you'll begin to see the cursor on your screen move very slowly, keeping your monitor from going to sleep. That's pretty much all there is to it. Once your mouse is on the jiggler you can get up, make lunch, do whatever you need, and your computer won't go to sleep. It won't make you more productive, of course, but it may trick some surveillance software into thinking you're still working, at least if that software is checking to see if your computer is active. We shouldn't need these gadgets in the first place, though. I was surprised to learn employer surveillance is more common than I thought. A recent examination by the New York Times found that 80% of the 10 largest private U.S. employers track the productivity metrics of individual workers. And secretly monitoring employees makes them more likely to the very break rules these systems are trying to deter, according to a recent study by Harvard Business Review. Transparency is key to keeping worker morale up. Instead of monitoring employees, explaining the scope and purpose of monitoring can boost employees' acceptance of the practice by about 70%, according to a recent study by Gartner, a management consultant company."},

Extended reality refers to technologies including virtual and augmented reality, which merge the physical and digital world. \"We're working with Qualcomm Technologies on customized virtual reality chipsets \u2014 powered by Snapdragon XR platforms and technology \u2014 for our future roadmap of Quest products,\" Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, said in a press release.

In the smartphone field, companies ranging from Apple to Samsung have designed their own custom processors to differentiate from competitors and create better products than they might have using off-the-shelf chips. A focus on custom chips by Meta makes sense as it looks to differentiate its headsets and possibly create unique experiences for users. \"Unlike mobile phones, building virtual reality brings novel, multi-dimensional challenges in spatial computing, cost, and form factor,\" Zuckerberg said. \"These chipsets will help us keep pushing virtual reality to its limits and deliver awesome experiences.\" The length of the deal between the companies and financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.

In a filing with the SEC, Nvidia said the U.S. government told the company on Aug. 26, about a new license requirement for future exports to China, including Hong Kong, to reduce the risk that the products may be used by the Chinese military. Nvidia said the restriction would affect the A100 and H100 products, which are graphics processing units sold to businesses. \"The license requirement also includes any future Nvidia integrated circuit achieving both peak performance and chip-to-chip I/O performance equal to or greater than thresholds that are roughly equivalent to the A100, as well as any system that includes those circuits,\" the filing said. The company expects that it could lose $400 million in potential sales in China in the current quarter after previously forecasting revenue of $5.9 billion. The new rule also applies to sales to Russia, but Nvidia said it doesn't have paying customers there. In recent years, the U.S. government has applied increasing export restrictions to chips made with U.S. technology because of fears that Chinese companies could use them for military purposes or steal trade secrets. Nvidia said it was applying for a license to continue some Chinese exports but doesn't know whether the U.S. government will grant an exemption. \"We are working with our customers in China to satisfy their planned or future purchases with alternative products and may seek licenses where replacements aren't sufficient,\" an Nvidia spokesperson told CNBC. \"The only current products that the new licensing requirement applies to are A100, H100 and systems such as DGX that include them.\" An AMD representative confirmed to CNBC that it had also received new licensing requirements from the U.S. Department of Commerce which it believed applied to its MI250 circuit, which is intended for artificial intellegence.

During an interview at the Ambrosetti Forum in Italy it was put to Starace that, in some people's view, oil and gas would be key for energy over the next 25 years, a contention he disputed. \"I totally disagree, because this is a view that is coming from, say, 15 years ago,\" he said. \"Was that wrong at that time? No, it was not. Now it's wrong.\" \"The economy can work much better, relying much less on fossil fuels, than people think,\" he went on to add. \"It will take maybe another two years before everybody understands that \u2014 but we are there.\" Despite this optimism about the future, today's reality on the ground is hugely challenging. The current situation in Europe, where many countries are attempting to wean themselves off Russian energy following the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine, illustrates the crucial role fossil fuels still play in society. With colder months closing in, European nations have been looking to shore up gas storage in a bid to ensure security of supply. Looking ahead, Enel's Starace expressed confidence Europe had prepared for the coming winter. \"Insofar as storage is concerned, Europe \u2026 did the right thing,\" he said, noting that most countries were \"pretty full.\" \"Now, the question is what happens if gas is cut altogether from Russia,\" Starace went on to state. \"Well, we're almost there, the cut is actually almost there.\" \"We have a view, and there are many studies showing that with some sacrifices, [such as] two notches of temperature down, and a little bit of attention to gas consumptions \u2026 Europe can make it through the wintertime.\" \"The question is when we get to the spring [of] 2023 with totally depleted, really, reserves, and gas is still not flowing,\" he said. \"Is Europe able to re-establish the storage, with all the backup of floating regasifiers and energy coming from other parts of the world?

It also plans to leave the retail gas market in 2040. Starace's comments came on the same day that the EU's climate chief, Frans Timmermans, hammered home the urgency of the situation facing European economies in the face of rising energy prices and concerns about supply. \"We need to do everything we can to face this energy crisis and to make sure that we do everything we can to reduce the prices so that our citizens can still afford to heat their homes this winter,\" Timmermans, who was speaking to CNBC's Silvia Amaro at an event in Bali, Indonesia, said. He also stressed the importance of member states being \"in a position to address the issue of windfall profits, if necessary.\" \"So we'll try everything to make sure that our energy markets are functioning, and are functioning in a way that addresses the issues that we need to tackle.\" Timmermans was asked if \"doing everything\" meant the EU agreeing, in the short term, to imposing caps on the price of gas and electricity. \"Well, nothing's off the table right now,\" he replied. \"We're preparing all of that, but we have to make sure that what we do doesn't create more damage than it helps us address the issue.\" \"So we have to be extremely careful. It took us 30 years to build the energy markets, so we need to make sure we address today's issue without creating long term problems.\""},

This week, pet products retailer Chewy said it's not seeing any significant trade down among shoppers in pet food. Rival pet retailer Petco made similar remarks last week, though both noted a pullback in spending on products such as leashes and toys. The comments are in line with the trend of pet owners increasingly spoiling their cats and dogs with foods that are more like the dishes they'd feed themselves or other family members. To capitalize on the ongoing shift, Petco recently partnered with snack bar maker Clif to sell a version for pets. It also launched a line of frozen, human-grade meals for dogs. \"Pet parents are driving one of the biggest trends the pet industry has seen as they increasingly seek out fresh, human-grade food for all members of the family,\" Petco CEO Ron Coughlin said in a release. Coughlin said the growing \"humanization\" of animal companions is being led by Gen Z and Millennial consumers who are \"hyper focused\" on their pets' health and wellness. In addition to more premium foods, Chewy and Petco see their health products and services as a way to better compete with the low-price offerings from retailers such as Amazon and Walmart. Earlier this month, Chewy expanded its health offerings with CarePlus, a line of pet wellness and insurance offerings. For its second quarter, Chewy said net sales rose 12.8% from a year ago to $2.43 billion as shoppers shifted toward more fresh and premium food products. Petco said its sales rose 3.2% to $1.48 billion and reported a similar shift. Still, the pet category isn't shielded from the soaring inflation that's pressuring consumers. Both Petco and Chewy reported softening demand in products such as crates, beds, leashes and toys over the summer months. Chewy noted that such items don't have to be replaced as often as some other items, and that shoppers are opting to skip on them as prices rise. Chewy said the downturn in such products is temporary and that it expects demand will recover. Brian LaRose, Petco's chief financial officer, also said orders for the products \"are delayed, not canceled.\" Still, both companies tightened their full-year guidance, in part because of the softened demand. Both companies lowered their revenue guidance for the year. Petco said it now expects adjusted earnings per share of 77 to 81 cents. It previously forecast 97 cents to $1. Petco's shares are down down around 24% year to date, while Chewy's stock is down around 41%."},

It represents yet another example of beverage companies blurring the lines between drink categories, seeking to leverage existing brand loyalty while entering fast-growing categories. Gatorade's parent company, PepsiCo, has already expanded Mountain Dew into alcoholic and energy drinks. The company says Fast Twitch is designed to give athletes an extra boost before their workouts. The market for preworkout powders is growing, fueled by industry leaders such as Cellucor C4 and RSP Nutrition. But few preworkout drinks exist, and many consumers instead turn to carbonated, sugary energy drinks. Anuj Bhasin, general manager of Gatorade, said roughly 32 million consumers reject the energy drink category for the negative health effects. Fast Twitch aims to attract those consumers, offering plenty of caffeine but no sugar or carbonation. The new drink is slated to launch in February, but NFL players will be drinking it on sidelines during the upcoming season as part of an exclusive deal with the league. Bhasin said Gatorade worked with the NFL and its sports performance experts to develop the specific formula. The finished product comes in a petite 12-ounce bottle with brightly colored packaging. While smaller, it tastes pretty similar to traditional Gatorade. A bottle of Fast Twitch contains electrolytes, B-vitamins and 200 milligrams of caffeine. For comparison, a 12-ounce can of Red Bull has nearly half as much caffeine but 37 grams of sugar. Bolt24, another recent offshoot of Gatorade, has just 75 milligrams of caffeine in its Energize line, which is being phased out. \"Two hundred milligrams is the right amount to help athletes seeking benefits for exercise performance,\" said Matthew Pahnke, senior principal scientist at the Gatorade Sports Science Institute. Since its creation nearly six decades ago, Gatorade has built its brand on hydration, spreading the word about the benefits of electrolytes and carbohydrates. But caffeine is a natural diuretic, removing salt and water from the body. As a result, Fast Twitch is meant to precede drinking a more hydrating beverage during an actual workout, the company says. \"We know athletes will mix and match things,\" Pahnke said. Fast Twitch will target consumers who are 18 years old or older due to the high caffeine content, according to Bhasin. Fast Twitch follows a broader push by Pepsi into energy drinks. Over the last three years, the company bought Rockstar Energy for $3.85 billion, launched Mtn Dew Rise Energy with the endorsement of NBA superstar Lebron James and acquired a minority stake in up-and-coming energy drink maker Celsius for $550 million. Celsius is a potential competitor for Fast Twitch. The upstart markets its beverages as \"fitness drinks,\" and its marketing shows models swinging kettle bells and stretching. Another challenger also has ties to Gatorade's parent company. Bang Energy, which recently ended an acrimonious distribution deal with Pepsi, markets itself as a preworkout or recovery drink. Beyond being highly caffeinated, it touts \"super creatine,\" which claims to boost muscle performance, but no sugar. But Pepsi is already the dominant leader in the U.S. sports drink category, holding 73.2% market share with Gatorade and G Zero, according to Euromonitor International data. Bodyarmor jumped to second place in 2021 with 11.7% market share, overtaking Coca-Cola 's Powerade. Coke purchased full control of Bodyarmor in November for $5.6 billion in a play to increase its market share. Changing consumer tastes led to slowing sales growth for the sports drink market, even as U.S. adults exercise more. Years of backlash from lawmakers and pediatricians about sports drinks' high sugar and calorie counts didn't help either. But Gatorade staged a comeback, focusing on options with more electrolytes and less sugar, such as recent spin-offs G Fit, Gatorlyte and Bolt24. In the second quarter, Pepsi reported double-digit revenue growth for the Gatorade brand. However, not all of Gatorade's innovations have paid off. An organic version of the drink released in 2016 failed to take off and was discontinued several years later. Energy represents an opportunity in a fast-growing segment, but it lacks trust from consumers who exercise. Gatorade, on the other hand, has earned plenty of trust from that customer base. \"We found this to be the sweet spot of bringing a new brand to market, with the distinction of being from the makers of Gatorade, much like Propel,\" Bhasin said."},

The company also raised its outlook for the year. Shares rose about 9% in off-hours trading. Here's what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by Refinitiv: Same store sales grew 23%, which beat StreetAccount's estimate of 17.6%. Net sales rose 29% to $1.87 billion. The company said that traffic remains strong both in stores and online, even as surging inflation cramps consumers' spending. Lululemon has a higher-income customer base that seems mostly unfettered by inflationary pressures. Still, other higher-end retailers like Nordstrom and Macy's slashed their outlook this quarter on fears of slowing demand. Lululemon, on the other hand, has boosted its guidance in two consecutive quarters. \"Despite the challenges around us in the macro-environment, guest traffic in our stores and on our e-commerce sites remains robust, which speaks to the strength of our multi-dimensional operating model,\" Chief Financial Officer Meghan Frank said in a news release. Store traffic increased over 30%, and ecommerce traffic rose over 40%, executives said on the earnings call Thursday. The company is hoping to boost customer loyalty with a soon-to-launch membership program. The membership program was announced at the end of the first quarter. It has a free tier and a $39 per month paid tier which give subscribers early access to product drops and exclusive items, as well as invitations to in-person events. The company said the traffic increases were not attributable to promotional programs or product markdowns. \"We have not changed our promotional cadence,\" CEO Calvin McDonald said on the earnings call. \"We have no plans to do so.\" Lululemon continued brick-and-mortar expansion during the quarter, with 21 net new stores for a total of 600 locations. Inventories were up 85% to $1.5 billion compared to the same period last year, but the company said it was \"under-inventoried\" at the time due to supply chain bottlenecks. Retailers in general have had to contend with swelling inventory levels as shoppers adjust their spending habits. Lululemon said Thursday it is confident the inventory level will help it boost sales during the holiday shopping season. The company said it now expects 2022 revenue of between $7.865 billion and $7.940 billion, up from the range of $7.610 billion to $7.710 billion it stated last quarter. The company also raised its adjusted earnings per share outlook to a range of $9.75 to $9.90, from last quarter's guidance of $9.35 to $9.50 adjusted. The release also maintained the company's long-term outlook of doubling net revenue to $12.5 billion from from 2021 to 2026. The plan includes an expansion of its menswear business, footwear, and membership-based fitness classes. Upon the plan's announcement in the spring, some analysts were skeptical about Lululemon's ability to achieve the lofty longer-term target. Lululemon touted some early success with the plan. It launched new shoes during the quarter, while its men's business saw 27% growth. The company also reported growth across all of the countries in which stores are currently active.

The city's Department of Consumer and Worker Protection said the case marks its first lawsuit for a violation of New York City's \"just cause\" protections for fast-food workers. Austin Locke, a longtime barista and union organizer, was fired less than a month after he and his coworkers voted to unionize a Starbucks in Queens, according to the lawsuit. The store is one of dozens of Starbucks locations that have voted to unionize. Starbucks had said that Locke was fired for failing to fill out a Covid-19 questionnaire and falsely reporting that a supervisor made physical contact with him, according to the city's lawsuit. The missteps were reportedly confirmed by surveillance footage, but the suit states that Locke's district and store manager did not let him see that footage. Locke's shifts were canceled, and he filed a complaint to the city days later. \"We do not comment on pending litigation,\" a Starbucks representative wrote to CNBC. \"However, we do intend to defend against the alleged violations of the New York City Just Cause Law.\" Under the city's Fair Workweek law, it is illegal to fire workers who have completed a 30 day probation or reduce their hours by more than 15% without just cause or an economic justification. The city is suing to get Locke reinstated and to win him restitution and back pay, which the city says will continue to accrue until Locke returns to his job. \"It's been a year since the campaign with Starbucks Workers United began at a Starbucks in Buffalo, NY,\" said Austin Locke in a statement released by the city. \"There are now 235 unionized Starbucks around the country. Starbucks continues to wrongfully fire pro-union workers nationwide in retaliation for union organizing.\" Starbucks has seen a wave of stores unionize across the country, and organizers have brought claims of retaliation by the company. Howard Schultz returned to the company as interim CEO amid the labor push, and has said he wants to reinvent the employee, customer and store experience to better reflect how the world has changed since the pandemic.

Speaking to CNBC at the Ambrosetti Forum in Italy, Ferguson said the catalyst events had already occurred to spark a repeat of the 70s, a period characterized by financial shocks, political clashes and civil unrest. Yet this time, the severity of those shocks was likely to be greater and more sustained. \"The ingredients of the 1970s are already in place,\" Ferguson, Milbank Family Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University, told CNBC's Steve Sedgwick. \"The monetary and fiscal policy mistakes of last year, which set this inflation off, are very alike to the 60s,\" he said, likening recent price hikes to the 1970's doggedly high inflation. \"And, as in 1973, you get a war,\" he continued, referring to the 1973 Arab-Israeli War \u2014 also known as the Yom Kippur War \u2014 between Israel and a coalition of Arab states led by Egypt and Syria. As with Russia's current war in Ukraine, the 1973 Arab-Israeli War led to international involvement from then-superpowers the Soviet Union and the U.S., sparking a wider energy crisis. Only that time, the conflict lasted just 20 days. Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine has now entered into its sixth month, suggesting that any repercussions for energy markets could be far worse. \"This war is lasting much longer than the 1973 war, so the energy shock it is causing is actually going to be more sustained,\" said Ferguson. Politicians and central bankers have been vying to mitigate the worst effects of the fallout, by raising interest rates to combat inflation and reducing reliance on Russian energy imports. But Ferguson, who has authored 16 books, including his most recent \"Doom: The Politics of Catastrophe,\" said there was no evidence to suggest that current crises could be avoided. \"Why shouldn't it be as bad as the 1970s?\" he said. \"I'm going to go out on a limb: Let's consider the possibility that the 2020s could actually be worse than the 1970s.\" Among the reasons for that, he said, were currently lower productivity growth, higher debt levels and less favorable demographics now versus 50 years ago. \"At least in the 1970s you had detente between superpowers. I don't see much detente between Washington and Beijing right now. In fact, I see the opposite,\" he said, referring to recent clashes over Taiwan. Humans like to believe that global shocks happen with some degree of order or predictability. But that, Ferguson said, is a fallacy. In fact, rather than being evenly spread throughout history, like a bell curve, disasters tend to happen non-linearly and all at once, he said. \"The distributions in history really aren't normal, particularly when it comes to things like wars and financial crises or, for that matter, pandemics,\" said Ferguson. \"You start with a plague \u2014 or something we don't see very often, a really large global pandemic \u2014 which kills millions of people and disrupts the economy in all kinds of ways. Then you hit it with a big monetary and fiscal policy shock. And then you add the geopolitical shock.\" That miscalculation leads humans to be overly optimistic and, ultimately, unprepared to handle major crises, he said. \"In their heads, the world is kind of a bunch of averages, and there aren't likely to be really bad outcomes. This leads people ... to be somewhat overoptimistic,\" he said. As an example, Ferguson said he surveyed attendees at Ambrosetti \u2014 a forum in Italy attended by political leaders and the business elite \u2014 and found low single-digit percentages expect to see a decline in investment in Italy over the coming months. \"This is a country that's heading towards a recession,\" he said."},

The buyout offers, which are being outlined to Buick dealers Friday, are the latest efforts by GM to accelerate the company's electric vehicle plans and transform its sales network. All of Buick's roughly 2,000 U.S. franchise dealers will be given the opportunity to take a buyout, Duncan Aldred, global head of Buick, told The Wall Street Journal. \"Not everyone necessarily wants to make that journey, depending on where they're located or the level of expenditure that the transition will demand,\" he told the publication. \"So if they want to exit the Buick franchise, then we will give them monetary assistance to do so.\" Michelle Malcho, a company spokeswoman, on Friday confirmed the buyout plans to CNBC but declined to disclose the expected cost or how many dealers GM anticipates will take the offer. Many Buick dealers also sell GMC vehicles or another one of GM's U.S. brands. The company offered similar buyouts to Cadillac dealers in 2020. About 150, or 17%, of those 880 retailers accepted the offer rather than assume expectations to invest at least $200,000 toward upgrading dealerships for electric vehicles. Buyout offers for Cadillac dealers ranged from about $300,000 to more than $1 million, a person familiar with the plans previously told CNBC. Malcho declined to disclose how much Buick dealers would be offered. Buick's EV plans are part of a broader $30 billion investment by GM into electric vehicles by 2025. That investment is expected to lead to about 30 new EVs globally from the automaker, which has pledged to exclusively offer electric vehicles by 2035."},

The lawsuit also names MicroStrategy as a defendant. Racine alleges the company conspired to help Saylor evade the taxes. The AG's office said it's seeking to recover a total sum of over $100 million in unpaid taxes and penalties. Shares of MicroStrategy were down more than 6% Wednesday afternoon on the news. Saylor, who oversaw the company's push into bitcoin, stepped down as CEO earlier this month. Under his leadership, MicroStrategy spent close to $4 billion acquiring bitcoin at an average price of $30,700, and he has said he considers the company's stock a sort of bitcoin ETF. Saylor allegedly claimed to reside in Virginia or Florida, which have lower or no personal income tax rates, while actually living in several different homes around D.C., including a penthouse apartment in the Georgetown neighborhood or on his yacht on the Georgetown waterfront or Potomac River when the apartment was undergoing renovations, according to the lawsuit. The suit includes several screenshots of posts that appear to be from Saylor's Facebook page dating back several years and referencing the view from his \"Georgetown balcony\" and discussing his \"home\" while tagging Washington, D.C. MicroStrategy allegedly \"had detailed information confirming that Saylor was in fact a DC resident,\" according to a press release, but it chose to withhold that information. In a statement, MicroStrategy said, \"The case is a personal tax matter involving Mr. Saylor. The Company was not responsible for his day-to-day affairs and did not oversee his individual tax responsibilities. Nor did the Company conspire with Mr. Saylor in the discharge of his personal tax responsibilities. The District of Columbia's claims against the Company are false and we will defend aggressively against this overreach.\" Around 2014, the AG's office claims in the lawsuit, MicroStrategy's then-chief financial officer confronted Saylor about his alleged tax evasion being a potential liability for the company. Saylor and MicroStrategy ended up reaching an agreement where Saylor's salary would be reduced to a nominal $1, the lawsuit claims, in order to reduce the risk authorities would discover the alleged scheme. Still, the AG alleges, Saylor continued to benefit from \"fringe benefits\" with a \"high cash value,\" such as use of the company plane. \"A decade ago, I bought an historic house in Miami Beach and moved my home there from Virginia,\" Saylor said in a statement. \"Although MicroStrategy is based in Virginia, Florida is where I live, vote, and have reported for jury duty, and it is at the center of my personal and family life. I respectfully disagree with the position of the District of Columbia, and look forward to a fair resolution in the courts.\" The suit is the first to be brought under a recently passed law called the False Claims Act, according to Racine's office. The district law incentivizes whistleblowers to report tax fraud and allows the court to impose penalties up to three times the amount of the evaded taxes, according to the AG's office. The district suit follows a separate complaint filed by whistleblowers against Saylor in April 2021, accusing him of failing to pay income taxes from 2014 through 2020. The complaint was filed under seal but made public on Wednesday. The AG's office said it independently investigated the whistleblower case and found MicroStrategy had filed inaccurate W-2s with his Florida-based address and had failed to withhold taxes allegedly owed to the district. The new lawsuit alleges Saylor failed to pay income tax he owed to the district starting in 2005. \u2014 MacKenzie Sigalos contributed to this story.

He'll join Starbucks in October, learning about the company and its reinvention plan, before assuming the top job in April. Until then, Howard Schultz will continue as interim CEO of the coffee chain he grew into a global giant. Schultz will remain on Starbucks' board after Narasimhan succeeds him. Schultz has been at the helm since April, when his handpicked successor Kevin Johnson retired after five years on the job. Schultz returned to the company as its interim CEO, earning just $1 for his salary. In the meantime, Schultz and the Starbucks board hunted for a long-term successor, with the intention of announcing the new CEO in the fall. (The coffee chain brought back the Pumpkin Spice Latte and other fall menu items on Tuesday.) Schultz has previously said that he wants to reinvent the employee, customer and store experience to reckon with how the world has changed since the pandemic. The company is holding an investor day on Sept. 13 in Seattle, where it's expected to unveil more details about the bold changes it plans to make. Starbucks said in a news release that Schultz will remain \"closely involved\" with the plan and act as an advisor to Narasimhan. Narasimhan previously worked at PepsiCo, serving as its global chief commercial officer among other roles. Prior to working at the food and beverage giant, he was a senior partner at McKinsey. As CEO, he'll have to tackle a number of challenges. In its home market, Starbucks is facing a union push, with more than 200 stores in the U.S. voting to organize under Workers United. The battle has resulted in negative headlines and legal battles. Inflation hasn't hurt sales yet, but it has pushed menu prices higher. And China, its second-largest market, is struggling to bounce back from the pandemic, hampered by the country's zero Covid policy. \"His deep, hands-on experience driving strategic transformations at global consumer-facing businesses makes him the ideal choice to accelerate Starbucks growth and capture the opportunities ahead of us,\" Starbucks board chair Mellody Hobson said in a statement."},

Many U.S. franchisees cheered the decision, but customers have been asking the company's Twitter account about when all-day breakfast will return. A Twitter user revived the conversation on Thursday, tweeting a screenshot of a McDonald's press release that said all-day breakfast would be served starting Oct. 6. But bad news for Egg McMuffin lovers: a McDonald's representative confirmed that the release is from 2015, when the chain created its all-day breakfast menu. Former CEO Steve Easterbrook launched the menu as part of a turnaround plan to revitalize the burger chain's sluggish sales, and the company credited the move for driving sales growth. But it looks unlikely that the all-day breakfast menu will return. Even before the pandemic, operators had been asking the company to whittle down all-day breakfast items to speed up service. As McDonald's management began looking to add menu items back after lockdowns ended, CEO Chris Kempczinski told analysts that his team was working with franchisees to make sure \"every item that we add earns its way back onto the menu.\" With franchisee relations at a low point now over disagreements to new ownership terms, bringing back all-day breakfast could further fuel tensions."},

The decision will affect flights by Xiamen, Air China, China Southern Airlines and China Eastern Airlines from Sept. 5 to Sept. 28. The U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) cited the recent cancellation of 26 American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines flights over Covid-19 cases. The suspensions include 19 China-bound flights from Los Angeles and 7 China Eastern flights from New York. The Chinese Embassy in Washington's spokesperson Liu Pengyu said the USDOT action was \"extremely irresponsible\" and \"groundlessly suspended Chinese airline flights.\" The embassy said China's Covid-19 \"circuit breaker\" measures were fair and transparent, applied both to Chinese and foreign airlines and were consistent with bilateral air transportation agreements. USDOT said as of Aug. 7 Chinese authorities had revised their policies so if the number of passengers on a flight to China testing positive for Covid-19 reached 4% of the total, one flight would be suspended. If it reached 8%, two flights would be suspended. USDOT said the U.S. has repeatedly raised objections with China, saying the rules place \"undue culpability on carriers\" when travelers test negative before boarding their flight from the United States only to \"test positive for Covid-19 after their arrival in China.\" Beijing and Washington have sparred over air services since the start of the pandemic. In January, the Transportation Department suspended 44 China-bound flights from the United States by the four Chinese carriers in response to China's decision suspend 44 flights by U.S. carriers. In August 2021, USDOT limited four flights from Chinese carriers to 40% passenger capacity for four weeks after Beijing imposed identical limits on four United Airlines flights. Three U.S. airlines and four Chinese carriers typically operate about 20 flights a week between the countries, well below the figure of more than 100 a week before the pandemic."},

The FBI had probable cause to believe that records containing classified national defense information would be found at the Palm Beach, Florida, residence, according to an agent who wrote the 32-page affidavit. \"There is also probable cause to believe that evidence of obstruction will be found\" at Trump's home, read an unredacted portion of the affidavit. A federal judge had ordered the key document's release over the objections of the DOJ, which argued it contains highly sensitive facts about the ongoing criminal investigation into Trump. U.S. Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart accepted the DOJ's proposed redactions to the affidavit one day before it was made public. Click here or scroll down to read the heavily redacted affidavit. \"The government is conducting a criminal investigation concerning the improper removal and storage of classified information in unauthorized spaces, as well as the unlawful concealment and removal of government records,\" the FBI agent, whose name was blacked out, wrote in the affidavit's first line. The agent then wrote that the probe began because of a referral from the National Archives and Records Administration in February, after NARA received 15 boxes of records from Trump's residence in Florida. By law, presidential records must be turned over to the National Archives when a president departs office. The FBI found that in those boxes were documents that bore classification markings, and included records relating to national defense information, which had been stored at Mar-a-Lago in an unsecured location. The 15 boxes included 184 specific documents marked classified, 67 of which were marked \"confidential,\" 92 marked \"secret\" and 25 documents marked \"top secret,\" according to the affidavit. \"Based upon this investigation, I do not believe that any spaces within the PREMISES have been authorized for the storage of classified information at least since the end of FPOTUS 's Presidential Administration on January 20, 2021,\" the agent wrote in the affidavit. Of the 32 pages of the affidavit, 21 pages are almost totally or significantly blacked out. The search warrant itself was revealed voluntarily by the DOJ less than a week after the Aug. 8 raid. The warrant indicated that FBI agents were looking for materials showing violations of laws against obstruction of justice and the removal of official records, as well as the U.S. Espionage Act. The FBI took at least 20 boxes of items in the August raid, including numerous sets of highly classified documents, according to a property receipt that was also made public by the DOJ. In a social media post after the redacted affidavit was released, Trump accused the FBI and DOJ of \"public relations subterfuge\" by the fact that the word \"Nuclear\" did not appear in the document \u2014 though he also noted that it was \"heavily redacted!!!\" The affidavit did not detail the specific content of documents it expected to find. Trump also lashed out at Reinhart, arguing that he should have recused himself from this matter because he had previously removed himself from another case involving the former president. The reason for that recusal was not clear, news outlets reported, but Trump claimed it was \"based on his animosity and hatred of your favorite President, me.\" The government argued last week against releasing the affidavit, even in a redacted form. \"The redactions necessary to mitigate harms to the integrity of the investigation would be so extensive as to render the remaining unsealed text devoid of meaningful content,\" read a court filing from Jay Bratt, head of the counterintelligence and export control section of the DOJ's National Security Division. Bratt also argued that the affidavit \"would serve as a roadmap to the government's ongoing investigation\" if disclosed. Reinhart disagreed, and ordered the government to propose redactions to U.S. District Court in West Palm Beach, Florida, by Thursday. The judge accepted the DOJ's redactions later that day. The government said last week that the Mar-a-Lago raid is part of a probe that \"implicates national security\" and is still in its \"early stages.\" Trump, who first revealed the FBI's search of his Florida residence, has cast himself as the victim of a political attack by the Biden administration that was carried out against the presumptive Republican front-runner in the 2024 presidential race. The former president on Monday sued the government, asking a federal judge to block the DOJ from poring over the documents seized from Mar-a-Lago until a court-appointed third party reviews them. \"The political Hacks and Thugs had no right under the Presidential Records Act to storm Mar-a-Lago and steal everything in sight, including Passports and privileged documents,\" Trump said in a social media post earlier Friday morning.

Bartiromo, the anchor of Fox Business programs \"Mornings with Maria\" and \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" is slated to appear for a deposition on Sept. 8, according to court filings. In recent days, Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson and Jeanine Pirro were among the network hosts scheduled to appear for questioning in Dominion's lawsuit, which is seeking $1.6 billion in damages from the cable news network. Dominion has argued that Fox Corp. 's Fox News and Fox Business made false claims that its voting machines rigged the results of the 2020 election between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Top brass Rupert Murdoch and Lachlan Murdoch are also expected to be deposed since the parent company has been sued, too. The case is being closely watched by First Amendment experts and advocates in part because of Dominion's lengthy list of examples that Fox network hosts repeatedly made false claims, even after the facts came to light. Libel lawsuits are often centered around one falsehood, and media companies are broadly protected by the First Amendment. Such cases are usually settled out of court or dismissed quickly by a court judge, experts say. But in December, the Delaware judge overseeing the Dominion case denied Fox News' request to have the case dismissed. Neither side has shown signs of entering discussions or reaching a settlement, according to people familiar with the matter, although that could change before the trial's expected start in April. Fox has vigorously denied the claims. \"Fox has put forth a First Amendment argument that this defamation case is aimed at punishing their speech and journalism, and this is an important component of their argument,\" said Roy Gutterman, an expert on communications law and free speech at Syracuse University's Newhouse School of Public Communications. But Gutterman said those rights can be limited \"by the concept of falsity, especially if it can bring harm to an individual or business.\" The depositions are private, as are the documents that Dominion has been collecting through the discovery process. Fox has asked the court to keep all of the collected materials private, claiming that Dominion mischaracterized what the documents show as actual malice. In court papers, Dominion has pointed to the rhetoric of hosts like Bartiromo, a former CNBC anchor, and former host Lou Dobbs and that they continued to feature guests \u2013 including Trump attorneys Rudy Giuliani and Sydney Powell \u2013 who made false claims that voter fraud was the reason Trump didn't surpass Biden to win the 2020 election. Dobbs was also previously scheduled for questioning, filings show. \"Fox, one of the most powerful media companies in the United States, gave life to a manufactured storyline about election fraud that cast a then-little-known voting machine company called Dominion as the villain,\" the company said in its initial court filing in March 2021. Fox News' legal team recently added veteran trial attorney Dan Webb to its roster. Webb told the Washington Post earlier this week that Fox News was only reporting on the news and claims being made by Trump's allies. \"We are confident we will prevail as freedom of the press is foundational to our democracy and must be protected, in addition to the damages claims being outrageous, unsupported and not rooting in sound financial analysis, serving as nothing more than a flagrant attempt to deter our journalists from doing their jobs,\" a Fox News spokesperson said in a statement. To win a defamation case, a plaintiff needs to show that the individual or business they're suing made false statements that caused harm, and that it acted with \"actual malice,\" meaning the speaker knew or should have known what they were saying wasn't true. \"A key issue in these depositions will be the state of mind of Fox as embodied by the journalists covering this or commenting on it,\" said Floyd Abrams, a prominent First Amendment attorney. \"What will someone like Lou Dobbs say? Will he say he believed what he was saying beyond simple reportage?\" Dominion said in court papers that it repeatedly sent emails to notify Fox News that its anchors and their guests were making false claims \u2013 and that Dominion had \"independent fact-checkers, government officials and election security experts\" that quashed those claims. Other current and former Fox News executives have been called on for depositions, court filings show. Dominion has also filed lawsuits against the TV networks One America News and Newsmax. Another voting machine maker, Smartmatic USA, has made similar claims in a defamation lawsuit against Fox News that alleged Dobbs and other hosts falsely accused the company of helping to rig the election. A New York judge earlier this year denied Fox News' motion to dismiss the lawsuit. Shortly after Smartmatic filed its lawsuit, Fox News canceled Dobbs' weekday business show, \"Lou Dobbs Tonight.\" Fox has previously said the move to end Dobbs' program was in the works prior to the lawsuit."},

The funds sent back to the SBA were obtained via the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program using both fabricated information and stolen identities. The suspects used Green Dot Bank, a fintech institution, to hold and move the fraudulent funds. More than 15,000 accounts were used in the conspiracy, by individuals in the U.S. as well as domestic and transnational organized crime rings, the agency said. Investigations are ongoing and further information about suspects was not immediately released. The investigation was initiated by the Secret Service field office in Orlando, Florida, and Green Dot bank worked with the agency to identify the fraudulent accounts. \"Fraudsters in general are always looking for ways and techniques to better do their crimes and modern conveniences are just one of those things they use. So currently, cryptocurrency is a big thing, fintechs, third-party payment systems. But there's not an institution, even our traditional financial institutions, that weren't targeted during the pandemic,\" Roy Dotson, lead investigator for the Secret Service, told CNBC in an interview. Initial investigations indicated the majority of the fraudulent accounts at Green Dot were established with synthetic and stolen identities, and involved using \"willing and unwilling money mules,\" Dotson said. The Secret Service and SBA Office of Inspector General put out advisories to 30,000 financial institutions in early 2020 to lay out fraud indicators and guide the banks to partner with federal agencies to recover fraudulent funds, Dotson said. He added these investigations will likely last years due to their size and scope. Green Dot said it has partnered with federal agencies including the Secret Service to identify fraud in the industry. \"Account protection and fraud prevention are top priorities for us, and we work around the clock and invest heavily to identify, block and address fraudulent activity. We're committed to protecting customers, and also to serving as [a] proactive ally to government agencies and industry peers as we work together to prevent fraud,\" Green Dot spokeswoman Alison Lubert said in a statement. OIG Inspector General Hannibal Ware said the partnership with the Secret Service has to date resulted in more than 400 indictments and nearly 300 convictions related to pandemic fraud. The U.S. government allocated more than $1 trillion to Main Street under both the Paycheck Protection Program and EIDL program. The PPP allowed small businesses to borrow loans that may be forgiven if the borrower used the majority of the capital on payroll, while the Covid-19 EIDL program allowed borrowers to access loans based on temporary losses of revenue due to the pandemic. An advance grant was also available under the EIDL. Reviews of the two programs by the SBA's Office of Inspector General warned that criminals would potentially exploit the system due to the fast-moving nature of the rollout and demand for aid. CNBC investigations revealed, in some cases, how easy it was for criminals to obtain fraudulent aid via stolen identities. The SBA OIG said it has identified $87 billion of potentially fraudulent EIDL loans. Over the past two years, the Secret Service said it has seized over $1.4 billion in fraudulently obtained funds and assisted in returning some $2.3 billion to state unemployment insurance programs. Nearly 4,000 pandemic-related fraud investigations and inquiries have been initiated by the Secret Service. More than 150 field offices and 40 cyber task forces are involved. \"This is not going to be a quick fix. As we talked about today, 15,325 accounts at one financial institution \u2014 this is one case, so you can just think of the potential number of suspects and how many investigations that could come out of those. And with all of our federal, state and local partners working this and having the same mission. It's going to be a long process,\" Dotson said at a news conference announcing the returned funds."},

One in five sellers in August dropped their asking price, according to Realtor.com. A year ago that share was just 11%. The average home sold for less than its list price for the first time in over 17 months during the four-week period ended Aug. 28, according to a report by Redfin. Homes are simply not selling at the breakneck pace they were six months ago, when strong demand butted up against tight supply, bidding wars were the norm, and a seller could often get a signed contract in under a weekend. Homes in August sat on the market an average five days longer than they did a year ago \u2014 the first annual increase in time on the market in over two years. The supply of homes for sale is also rising fast, up nearly 27% from a year ago, even as fewer sellers decide to list. Pending sales in July, which represent signed contracts on existing homes and which are the most recent sales data available, were nearly 20% lower than July 2021, according to the National Association of Realtors. \"For many of today's buyers, the uptick in for-sale home options is taking away the sense of urgency that they felt during the past two years, when inventory was scarce,\" said Danielle Hale, chief economist for Realtor.com. \"As a result of this shift, coupled with higher mortgage rates, competition continued to cool in August, with listing price trends indicating that home shoppers are tightening their purse strings.\" The median listing price in August dropped to $435,000 from $449,000 in July, according to Realtor.com. Mortgage rates have been rising since January, hitting a recent high in June and then falling back slightly in July and much of August. They are, however, rising again and are now nearly matching that June high. Redfin reported that requests for home tours and other home-buying services from its agents at the end of August was down 16% from the same period the year before. Touring activity was also down 9% from the start of the year, compared with an 11% increase at the same time last year, according to home tour technology company ShowingTime. \"The post-Labor Day slowdown will likely be a little more intense this year than in previous years when the market was super tight,\" said Daryl Fairweather, Redfin's chief economist. \"Expect homes to linger on the market, which may lead to another small uptick in the share of sellers lowering their prices.\""},

Mark Kelly in November's election, according to people familiar with the matter. Masters has received urgent private calls in recent weeks from GOP leaders like Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., the head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, these people explained. The NRSC is the official campaign arm for the Senate GOP, and has spent over $6 million taking on Masters' rival Kelly, according to data from the nonpartisan OpenSecrets. Kelly's seat has long been considered a potential pickup opportunity for Republicans, as forecaster Cook Political Report labels the race a toss-up. Recent polling, however, suggests that Masters is falling behind. A Fox News poll taken in August shows Kelly leading Masters by 8 points, while an Arizona Republican pollster told NBC News that his own surveys showed Masters trailing Kelly by 10 points. Longtime GOP megadonors, who want to help Masters overtake Kelly but have not heard from him since he won the party's primary, have inundated the Republican candidate with calls, these people explained. A person familiar with one of the recent calls to Masters said a veteran GOP financier \"read him the riot act\" and told him, in part, that he must start raising money from more wealthy Republican donors and stop relying on billionaire tech executive Peter Thiel, his longtime colleague and friend, to help him like he did in the primary. These people declined to be named in order to speak freely about private conversations. Shortly after publication of this story, Katie Miller, a spokeswoman for the Masters campaign, denied that the candidate ever heard from a GOP megadonor who \"read him the riot act.\" Miller told CNBC in an email: \"It didn't happen.\" Kelly has massively outraised Masters, who won a Republican primary in Arizona this month. The incumbent's campaign has amassed more than $54 million during the 2022 election cycle, compared with just over $4 million for Masters' campaign, according to the latest Federal Election Commission data. Thiel contributed $15 million during the primary to a pro-Masters super PAC, Saving Arizona, and he donated $1.5 million to the committee as recently as July. Masters was the chief operating officer at Thiel Capital, an investment firm founded by Thiel. The calls to Masters come as even some Republican leaders seem to be questioning their Senate candidates. When asked about his predictions for the midterms, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said\"candidate quality\" has a lot to do with winning Senate elections. He added that he believes there will be an \"extremely close Senate\" after November's elections. The Senate is currently split 50-50 between Democrats and Republicans. In a statement to CNBC, NRSC spokesman Chris Hartline did not deny that Scott called Masters to urge him to improve his fundraising operation. \"Mark Kelly votes with Joe Biden almost 100% of the time. While he claims to be a moderate, he's supported reckless Washington spending and done nothing to address the border crisis that's raging in Arizona. The NRSC will continue to remind Arizona voters of Mark Kelly's radical agenda and Blake Masters' plans to fight for Arizona families,\" Hartline said in response to questions about Scott's contact with Masters. Data from ad tracker AdImpact shows that the NRSC has booked just over $3.8 million in ads in Arizona for September, but nothing yet for October or November. The ad tracker also shows that Masters' campaign has not yet booked airtime for the fall while Kelly's team has reserved over $10 million in ad space from September through November. AdImpact says it has not yet seen data showing the Thiel-backed Saving Arizona reserve airtime for the fall. The last spending it saw from the super PAC was on Aug. 2, the day of the Arizona Senate Republican primary. The super PAC spent over $10 million during the primary, including almost $8.5 million backing Masters, according to OpenSecrets. Masters and his campaign did not return requests for comment. A spokesman for Saving Arizona did not return requests for comment. Thiel and his spokesman did not return requests for comment, including about whether the billionaire GOP donor plans to help Masters further. The candidates and outside groups from both sides of the aisle have combined to spend over $90 million in the general election Senate race in Arizona. Yet Democratic organizations appear to be outspending their Republican rivals in the Grand Canyon State on ads in the coming months. AdImpact's data shows Democratic outside groups are reserving nearly $28 million worth of ad time in Arizona over the next three months. Republican committees have so far spent just over $16 million on ad buys within the same time span trying to help Masters overtake Kelly, according to the data."},

A few states quickly followed through. Idaho sold $300,000 of bonds in a Russian oil company in early March. A day before the invasion, the Kentucky Teachers Retirement System sold its shares in the Russian bank Sberbank. But those examples are outliers. Six months into a war that has killed thousands of Ukrainians and displaced over 12 million more, most of the pledges to drop Russian investments \u2014 some made with great fanfare during news conferences \u2014 have gone unfulfilled, according to an Associated Press review, state retirement administrators and firms that invest state funds. Swift global reaction has cut off much of Russia's economy from the rest of the world. That has made it nearly impossible for divestment by state pension funds, university endowments and other public-sector holdings \u2014 as well as private investments such as those in 401(k) accounts. \"These pension funds want to get out, but it's just not realistic to sell everything in the current environment,\" said Keith Brainard, research director at the National Association of State Retirement Administrators. Benjamin Smith, a spokesperson for the Rhode Island treasury, said the factors that make it hard to divest also show that a worldwide effort to isolate Russian President Vladimir Putin is working. \"This is good news because it means that pressure from investors across the world, including Rhode Island, is succeeding in exacting a toll on the Russian economy, making it more difficult for Putin to fund his military operation, state-owned companies, and corrupt network of oligarchs,\" he said in an email, noting that Rhode Island's pension plan exposure in Russia never exceeded 0.3% of its assets. Any pre-war investments in Russia are now worthless, or nearly so. That's raising questions from some officials and fund managers about whether divesting is even necessary. In Hawaii, one of a handful of states where top administration officials did not pledge to divest, Gov. David Ige said at a May 5 news conference that the state's employee pension system had \"very little to almost nothing\" invested in Russia. \"The few remaining investments are quite small, and so I didn't feel compelled to just make a statement for political reasons that we would be divesting,\" he said. Before Russia's invasion in late February, many government-controlled investments had only small holdings \u2014 a fraction of 1% in every reported case \u2014 in Russian investments. But even that could amount to millions of dollars. The largest U.S. public-sector retirement fund, California's CalPERS, said just 17 cents of every $100 of its portfolio was in Russian investments as the war broke out. Even so, that translated into $765 million worth of stocks, real estate and private equity. By the end of June, the value had shrunk to $194 million. The entire loss was because the holdings dropped in value; none had been sold. There is no way to know how much state government entities in the U.S. have invested in Russia or companies based there, but collectively they were worth billions of dollars before the war. Much of the money was invested in Russian government bonds, oil and coal companies as part of emerging-markets index funds. Quick to condemn the invasion, state officials said they could put pressure on Putin by dumping their Russian investments. \"Our moral imperative before these atrocities demand that you act to address Russia's aggressions and immediately restrict Russian access to California's capital and investments,\" California Gov. Gavin Newsom wrote in a letter on Feb. 28 to the boards overseeing the massive pension funds that serve teachers, state and local government workers and university employees. Across the country, governors and other top officials made similar statements. Just after the invasion began, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul signed an executive order calling for divestment \"to the extent possible,\" while Arizona's Board of Regents voted to exit any Russian investments. The treasurers for 36 states plus the District of Columbia and U.S. Virgin Islands signed a joint letter in March advocating divestment of publicly controlled funds from Russia. They noted a financial reason for doing so: \"The current crisis also constitutes a substantial risk for states' investments and our economic security.\" A major chunk of the government holdings in Russia is in the form of index funds that investors use to mimic overall stock market performance. Russian stocks were commonly part of funds specializing in emerging markets. MCSI and other firms that decide which stocks should be in the funds quickly dropped Russian securities. But the companies that sell investment products based on those indexes were left in the lurch, still leaving pieces of Russian stocks in their investors' portfolios. As part of the sanctions, stock markets in the U.S. and elsewhere stopped the trading of Russian stocks. And the Moscow Stock Exchange was closed for nearly a month, reopening with tight controls that keep U.S. investors from selling. The assets sank in value amid the invasion, though the precise value isn't always clear. Maryland said that as of the beginning of February, $197 million of its state retirement and pension system funds were invested in Russian assets. A month later, the state estimated the value had plunged and amounted to just $32 million. The state has been unable to unload its investments. For the handful of states in which top officials have not endorsed divestment, eroding values like that are the main reason. Shortly after the invasion, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said the number of state investments in Russia was \"minuscule\" and noted that the value was about to \"shrink to almost nothing as the Russian economy is being virtually shut off from the world.\" In Florida, Lamar Taylor, the interim executive director of the agency that oversees investments of pension funds, said during a cabinet meeting that some investment managers might seek to unload Russian assets as soon as they're able, while others could hold on in case they're worth more later. At the meeting, Gov. Ron DeSantis said the State Board of Administration has a legal responsibility to try to make money for the retirement system. \"That would violate your fiduciary duty, if you liquidated at massive losses for political reasons rather than for the best interests of the beneficiaries,\" he said. But DeSantis said there was a way to make it easier: Lawmakers passing a bill banning investment in Russia. \"If the Legislature could speak clearly, that would be something we'd welcome here, just to make sure we're not furthering investments in parts of the world that are not reflective of our interests or values,\" he said. Hank Kim, executive director of the National Conference on Public Employee Retirement Systems, said he has told member pension funds that taking steps to divest is important even if it can't be completed right away. \"The public has a right to know that it was debated in a serious manner,\" he said."},

The previously unreported photo, released by the War College to Reuters after a request under the Freedom of Information Act, showed Mastriano in a 2013-14 portrait for the Department of Military Strategy, Plans, and Operations, where he worked. Faculty at the time had been given the option of dressing as a historical figure, people familiar with the photo said. At least 15 of the 21 faculty in the photo opted to appear in regular attire. Although one man wears a trench coat and sunglasses and another carries an aviator's helmet, Mastriano is the only one wearing a Confederate uniform. Mastriano did not immediately respond to requests for comment made by email and phone. A Reuters reporter attended a Mastriano event on Wednesday to seek comment, but the candidate did not make himself available for questions. Displays of Confederate symbols can be seen as insensitive to those who view them as painful reminders of racial oppression and the Civil War that saw 11 rebelling Confederate states fight to keep Black people enslaved. The U.S. military issued a de facto ban on displaying the Confederate flag and has sought to remove segregationist symbols from bases and academic institutions following the murder in May 2020 of George Floyd, a Black man whose killing by a white police officer in Minneapolis triggered protests worldwide. After Reuters made its formal request for the photo, it was removed from the War College wall where it had hung alongside other annual portraits of faculty groups. The Army War College (AWC), a premier military higher education institution in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, told Reuters a team had reviewed all art, text, and other images displayed at Carlisle Barracks in 2020, but missed the faculty photo. \"The faculty photo did not get the team's attention; the photo has since been removed because it does not meet AWC values,\" the college said in a statement. Asked about the War College photo, a spokesperson at U.S. Army headquarters said: \"The Army supports commanders who remove symbols or images that do not comport with Army values.\" Confederate symbols and dress have been embraced by white supremacists in the United States, and monuments and flags honoring the Confederacy have been removed from many public areas in recent years. Pennsylvania plays an outsized role in U.S. politics as a so-called swing state in presidential elections, and Republican Mastriano, who has embraced Trump's stolen election lies, is trailing his Democratic opponent in the governor's race ahead of the November ballot. It is unclear how the photo might be viewed in Pennsylvania, which played a critical role in the Civil War. More than 33,000 soldiers from Pennsylvania died fighting for the Union, and the state was the site of the Battle of Gettysburg, the conflict's bloodiest battle, which ended with a Union victory and inspired President Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. Mastriano's district, Pennsylvania's 33rd, includes Gettysburg. Many Americans continue to participate in Civil War battle re-enactments, wearing uniforms from both sides in an effort to preserve U.S. history."},

The judge scheduled a Thursday hearing to discuss the matter further. A special master is often a former judge. Cannon also directed the Justice Department to file under seal with her more detailed descriptions of the material taken from Trump's property. The former president's lawyers have complained that investigators did not disclose enough information to them about what specific documents were removed when agents executed a search warrant on Aug. 8 to look for classified documents.

John Eastman also invoked protections under attorney-client privilege in refusing to answer at least some questions he was asked before the grand jury, which was convened as part of a criminal probe into the possibility of illegal interference in Georgia's presidential election contest, his attorneys said. Eastman is one of a group of Trump allies who were subpoenaed by that panel, which is hearing testimony in Atlanta. A second ally, Trump's former personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, has been named a target in that investigation and recently testified before the same grand jury. Eastman wrote a series of memos after the 2020 election calling on then-Vice President Mike Pence to effectively undo President Joe Biden 's win by refusing to certify the Electoral College results. \"In his appearance before the Fulton County Special Grand Jury, we advised our client John Eastman to assert attorney-client privilege and the constitutional right to remain silent where appropriate,\" Eastman's lawyers, Charles Burnham and Harvey Silverglate, said in a statement. \"Out of respect for grand jury secrecy we will not disclose the substance of the questions or testimony. We wish to thank the grand jurors for their service,\" the attorneys said. The statement also blasted Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis for the probe itself. \"By all indications, the District Attorney's Office has set itself on an unprecedented path of criminalizing controversial or disfavored legal theories, possibly in hopes that the federal government will follow its lead,\" the lawyers said. \"Criminalization of unpopular legal theories is against every American tradition and would have ended the careers of John Adams, Ruth Ginsburg, Thurgood Marshall and many other now-celebrated American lawyers,\" the statement said. Adams was the second president of the United States, while Ginsburg and Marshall were Supreme Court justices who helped establish new legal precedents with their work during the civil rights movement. \"We ask all interested observers of any political persuasion to join us in decrying this troubling development,\" Burnham and Silverglate wrote. Eastman last month revealed that his cellphone was seized by federal agents who stopped him in New Mexico and forced him to unlock it. That seizure was done as part of an investigation by the Justice Department's internal watchdog, the Office of the Inspector General. The IG's office is probing the role of the Justice Department and its components in \"preparing for and responding to\" the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters, according to the office's website. That riot occurred as a joint session of Congress was convened to certify Biden's victory, with Pence presiding over the proceedings. A former Justice Department official, Jeffrey Clark, had electronics seized from his Virginia home on the same day that Eastman's phone was seized. Clark also backed Trump's effort to overturn the election. Trump considered installing Clark as attorney general in the days leading up to Jan. 6, 2021, but dropped the idea after a group of top Justice officials said they would resign in protest if that happened."},

The Justice Department argued in a court filing that Trump lacks the legal standing to appoint a special master. Appointing that watchdog could harm national security, the agency warned. The department also said it has evidence that government records likely were concealed and removed from a storage room at Trump's home at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, \"and that efforts were likely taken to obstruct the government's investigation.\" Trump had sued to block the Justice Department from further investigating any materials taken in the raid until a court-appointed special master is able to analyze them. That step is typically taken when there is a chance that some evidence should be withheld from prosecutors because of various legal privileges. \"As an initial matter, the former President lacks standing to seek judicial relief or oversight as to Presidential records because those records do not belong to him,\" the DOJ wrote to Judge Aileen Cannon in U.S. District Court in southern Florida. Cannon, who was appointed by Trump, has set a hearing for Thursday at 1 p.m. ET in a West Palm Beach courthouse. Trump's legal team has until Wednesday night to reply to the DOJ's latest submission. The DOJ is conducting a criminal investigation of the removal of White House documents and their shipment to Trump's residence at Mar-a-Lago when he left office. By law, presidential records must be turned over to the National Archives and Records Administration when a president departs office. The National Archives and Records Administration retrieved 15 boxes of records from Mar-a-Lago in January. The next month, NARA sent a referral to the DOJ that the records contained \"highly classified documents intermingled with other records,\" according to the affidavit used to obtain the warrant for the Aug. 8 search of Trump's home. The DOJ said in Tuesday night's filing that the FBI had \"uncovered multiple sources of evidence indicating ... that classified documents remained\" at Mar-a-Lago. \"The government also developed evidence that government records were likely concealed and removed from the Storage Room and that efforts were likely taken to obstruct the government's investigation,\" the DOJ wrote. That evidence contradicted a sworn certification letter on June 3 from the custodian of Trump's records, claiming that \"any and all\" documents responsive to a grand jury subpoena had been handed over, the DOJ wrote. The August search \"cast serious doubt on the claim in the certification ... that there had been 'a diligent search' for records responsive to the grand jury subpoena,\" according to the DOJ's filing. Of the evidence taken in that raid, \"over one hundred unique documents with classification markings \u2014 that is, more than twice the amount produced on June 3, 2022, in response to the grand jury subpoena \u2014 were seized,\" the DOJ wrote. \"That the FBI, in a matter of hours, recovered twice as many documents with classification markings as the 'diligent search' that the former President's counsel and other representatives had weeks to perform calls into serious question the representations made in the June 3 certification and casts doubt on the extent of cooperation in this matter,\" the DOJ wrote. The prosecutors also argued against the appointment of a special master, saying it is \"unnecessary\" and that doing so \"would significantly harm important governmental interests, including national security interests.\" That harm could include impeding the intelligence community's \"ongoing review of the national security risk\" that may have been caused by \"improper storage of these highly sensitive materials,\" the DOJ argued. The prosecutors concluded that Cannon should reject Trump's requests \"and decline to require the return of seized items, enjoin further review of seized materials, or appoint a special master.\" Tuesday's filing came one day after the DOJ told Cannon that its review of the seized materials was complete. The DOJ told the court on Monday that a law enforcement team had identified a \"limited set\" of materials that may be protected by attorney-client privilege. That privilege often refers to the legal doctrine that protects the confidentiality of communications between an attorney and their client. The so-called privilege review team \u2014 which is separate from the investigation that led the FBI to search Trump's residence earlier this month \u2014 is following a process to \"address potential privilege disputes, if any,\" the DOJ wrote. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence \"is also leading an intelligence community assessment of the potential risk to national security that would result from the disclosure of these materials,\" according to the filing. Before the DOJ posted its late-night response, a group of former government officials asked the judge to let them file a brief as \"amici curiae\" \u2014 Latin for \"friends of the court\" \u2014 arguing against Trump's requests. The group included six former federal prosecutors who served in Republican administrations, as well as former New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, who governed as a Republican but backed President Joe Biden over Trump in 2020."},

The narrowly focused filing in U.S. District Court in West Palm Beach came one day after the Department of Justice argued that appointing a special master could harm the government's national security interests. The DOJ's filing also said that \"efforts were likely taken to obstruct the government's investigation\" into the records that had been shipped to Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence after the end of his presidency. And the DOJ revealed that the FBI seized more than 100 classified documents from the Palm Beach resort during its search of the premises earlier this month. The agency also shared a redacted FBI photo showing documents with classification markings that had been recovered from a container in Trump's \"45 Office.\" Trump's legal team in its Wednesday night reply accused the DOJ of twisting \"the framework of responding to a motion for a Special Master into an all-encompassing challenge to any judicial consideration, presently or in the future, of any aspect of its unprecedented behavior in this investigation.\" The government's \"extraordinary document\" suggests \"that the DOJ, and the DOJ alone, should be entrusted with the responsibility of evaluating its unjustified pursuit of criminalizing a former President's possession of personal and Presidential records in a secure setting,\" Trump's lawyers wrote. They also accused the DOJ of providing multiple \"misleading or incomplete statement[s] of purported 'fact,'\" but offered few specifics. Judge Aileen Cannon, who was appointed by Trump, has set a hearing for Thursday at 1 p.m. ET in a West Palm Beach courthouse. Trump had sued to block the Justice Department from further investigating any materials taken in the Mar-a-Lago raid until a special master is able to analyze them. That step is typically taken when there is a chance that some evidence should be withheld from prosecutors because of various legal privileges. The DOJ told the judge on Monday that its review of the seized materials was complete, and that a law enforcement team had identified a \"limited set\" of materials that may be protected by attorney-client privilege. That privilege often refers to the legal doctrine that protects the confidentiality of communications between an attorney and their client. Trump's lawyers responded Wednesday that the so-called privilege review team was \"wholly deficient\" in identifying and separating all potentially privileged documents from the rest of the seized materials. Trump and his office have publicly claimed that he declassified all the documents that had been seized by the FBI. But Trump's legal team has not made that explicit argument in the civil lawsuit before Cannon. The DOJ in Tuesday's late-night filing said that when 15 boxes were retrieved from Mar-a-Lago by the National Archives in January, Trump \"never asserted executive privilege over any of the documents nor claimed that any of the documents in the boxes containing classification markings had been declassified.\" The government also said that no claims about declassification were made when FBI agents went to Mar-a-Lago on June 3, pursuant to a grand jury subpoena to collect any more records in Trump's possession that bore classification markings. The DOJ said it obtained that subpoena in May, after the FBI developed evidence that dozens of boxes with classified information \u2014 beyond the 15 boxes retrieved in January \u2014 were still at Trump's residence. \"When producing the documents, neither counsel nor the custodian asserted that the former President had declassified the documents or asserted any claim of executive privilege. Instead, counsel handled them in a manner that suggested counsel believed that the documents were classified: the production included a single Redweld envelope, double-wrapped in tape, containing the documents,\" the DOJ wrote. At the same time, Trump's custodian of records had also provided a sworn certification letter, claiming that \"any and all\" documents responsive to a grand jury subpoena had been handed over, the DOJ wrote. But the FBI later \"uncovered multiple sources of evidence\" indicating that more classified documents remained at Mar-a-Lago, according to the DOJ's filing. \"The government also developed evidence that government records were likely concealed and removed from the Storage Room and that efforts were likely taken to obstruct the government's investigation,\" the DOJ wrote. That and other information led the government to seek a warrant to search Mar-a-Lago, which was ultimately carried out Aug. 8. In their reply on Wednesday, Trump's lawyers wrote that the DOJ's account of the June 3 meeting \"has been significantly mischaracterized.\" \"If the Government provided the same untrue account in the affidavit in support of the search warrant, then they misled the Magistrate Judge,\" the former president's lawyers wrote. Trump, in a social media post earlier Wednesday evening, also accused the DOJ of being \"very deceiving\" by sharing a photo that appears to show numerous classified papers strewn about on a carpeted floor. Trump clarified that the FBI \"took them out of cartons and spread them around on the carpet, making it look like a big 'find' for them.\" \"They dropped them, not me - Very deceiving...And remember, we could have NO representative, including lawyers, present during the Raid. They were told to wait outside,\" Trump wrote."},

The \"limited set\" of potentially privileged information was identified by a team that is kept separate from the investigative squad that searched Trump's Palm Beach, Florida, residence earlier this month, DOJ officials said in a court filing in U.S. District Court in southern Florida on Monday morning. The so-called privilege review team \"completed its review of those materials\" and is following a process to \"address potential privilege disputes, if any,\" according to that filing. Attorney-client privilege often refers to the legal doctrine that protects the confidentiality of communications between an attorney and their client.

Judge Aileen Cannon, who was appointed by Trump, gave notice Saturday of her \"preliminary intent to appoint a special master\" in the case. Cannon ordered the government to publicly respond to Trump by Tuesday. She also ordered the DOJ to submit a sealed filing that provides more details about the seized materials, and she set a hearing for Thursday at 1 p.m. ET in a West Palm Beach courthouse. In response, top DOJ counterintelligence official Jay Bratt assured the judge that the government will comply with those orders. But \"the government notes that, before the Court issued its Preliminary Order, and in accordance with the judicially authorized search warrant's provisions, the Privilege Review Team ... identified a limited set of materials that potentially contain attorney-client privileged information\" and \"completed its review of those materials,\" Bratt wrote. The DOJ and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, or ODNI, \"are currently facilitating a classification review of materials recovered\" from Trump's residence, Bratt added. The ODNI \"is also leading an intelligence community assessment of the potential risk to national security that would result from the disclosure of these materials,\" he wrote. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre declined to answer reporters' specific questions about the DOJ probe later Monday, stressing that the agency is conducting its investigation independently and \"we have not been involved.\" She noted, however, neither President Joe Biden nor anyone else at the White House has been briefed on the matter, but declined to comment on any classified materials prepared for the president. Trump's civil lawsuit is being overseen by a different judge than the one who approved the search warrant for Mar-a-Lago. The affidavit for that search warrant \u2014 in which an FBI agent explained why the government had probable cause to believe the search would turn up evidence of illegality \u2014 was released Friday, albeit with heavy redactions. The National Archives and Records Administration retrieved 15 boxes of records from Mar-a-Lago in January. The next month, NARA sent a referral to the DOJ that the records contained \"highly classified documents intermingled with other records,\" according to the affidavit. By law, presidential records must be turned over to the National Archives when a president departs office. The FBI launched a criminal investigation and found that the 15 boxes included 184 specific documents marked classified, 67 of which were marked \"confidential,\" 92 marked \"secret\" and 25 marked \"top secret,\" according to the affidavit. The search warrant was revealed days after the FBI entered Mar-a-Lago in August. It indicated that FBI agents were looking for materials showing violations of laws against obstruction of justice and the removal of official records, as well as the U.S. Espionage Act. The FBI took at least 20 boxes of items in the August raid, including numerous sets of highly classified documents, according to a property receipt that was also made public by the DOJ."},

Charlie Crist announced Wednesday he will resign from Congress as he campaigns to unseat Florida's Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in November. The move will shrink Democrats' already-slim majority in the House, potentially complicating efforts to pass more legislation before the midterm elections when Republicans are currently favored to take control. Serving in Congress \"has been an honor and a privilege,\" Crist said in a statement, which did not mention his campaign for governor. \"From the bottom of my heart, thank you for trusting me as your Representative in Washington.\" Crist will step down by the close of business Wednesday, he said in the statement. Congressional staff for Crist's district will provide casework and constituent services until the next representatives are sworn in in January, the statement said. Florida's 13th Congressional District, where Crist has served since 2017, is considered a likely pickup for Republicans this November, according to the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. The district's political makeup shifted toward the GOP after a new congressional map, proposed by DeSantis, re-shaped the area. Crist handily won the Democratic nomination for Florida's gubernatorial race. But polls show him trailing DeSantis, a dominant figure in the GOP who is widely rumored to be gearing up for a 2024 presidential run. DeSantis has also far outraised Crist: The powerful Republican incumbent governor's campaign has raised more than $165 million since 2019, OpenSecrets reported earlier this month. DeSantis' stature in the party is exceeded perhaps only by former President Donald Trump, who has regularly teased the possibility of launching another White House bid. Crist's move mirrors DeSantis' decision in 2018 to resign from Congress as he campaigned for governor in a hotly contested race against Democrat Andrew Gillum. DeSantis at the time said that he did not want to be criticized for taking a U.S. representative's paycheck while missing votes."},

The deal does not cover a separate lawsuit involving the House Ways and Means Committee, which is seeking Trump's federal tax returns from 2015 through 2020. Last month, a federal appeals court said the Ways and Means Committee could get those returns. The agreement with the Oversight Committee came nearly two months after another panel of judges in the same appeals court in Washington, D.C., upheld a prior ruling that the Oversight Committee had the authority to subpoena certain of Trump's financial records from Mazars in furtherance of legislative purposes. However, the appeals court also told the committee to winnow the scope of the records it wanted to see. On Wednesday, Trump's lawyers told the court in a filing that in light of the settlement agreement with the Oversight Committee, he would drop a motion seeking a rehearing of the case, and a related one asking that the entire lineup of judges on the appeals court take up the issue. In a statement, committee Chairwoman Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., said, \"After facing years of delay tactics, the Committee has now reached an agreement with the former President and his accounting firm, Mazars USA, to obtain critical documents.\" \"These documents will inform the Committee's efforts to get to the bottom of former President Trump's egregious conduct and ensure that future presidents do not abuse their position of power for personal gain,\" Maloney said. The committee said that under the agreement, \"Mazars USA has agreed to comply with the court's order and produce responsive documents to the Committee as expeditiously as possible.\" A lawyer for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The committee sought the documents in 2019 as part of its investigation into Trump's conflicts of interest involving his businesses while serving as president and his foreign financial ties. The panel issued its subpoena to Mazars for Trump's records after his former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, testified to the Oversight Committee that Trump's financial statements had falsely represented his financial position. Trump then sued to block Mazars from surrendering the records. The case ended up before the Supreme Court, which in 2020 sent the lawsuit back to lower federal courts with the direction to apply a new standard for evaluating the merit of congressional subpoenas for a president's personal information."},

Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and FBI agents along with NYPD detectives were seen carrying boxes during a search of 19 Duck Pond Lane in Southampton, N.Y., and the search of 515 Park Ave. in Manhattan. Records show those properties are linked to sanctioned Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg, a billionaire and close ally of President Vladimir Putin who heads the Moscow-based Renova Group, a conglomerate with interests in the metals, mining, and tech industries, according to U.S. Treasury Department documents. A search is also underway at a property on Miami's Fisher Island that authorities say was linked to Vekselberg, according to sources familiar with the matter. The U.S. seizure of Vekselberg's $900 million superyacht in early April marked the first under newly imposed Western sanctions targeting assets of Russian elites in response to the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine. Vekselberg is one of numerous Russian oligarchs to face sanctions since the start of the war. In addition to sanctions, Vekselberg has been the subject of a U.S. Department of Justice investigation into allegations of bank fraud. No charges have been filed in that case. All of Vekselberg's assets in the U.S. are frozen and American companies are barred from doing business with him and his entities. The Ukrainian-born businessman built his fortune by investing in the aluminum and oil industries in the post-Soviet era. Vekselberg has long had ties to the U.S., including a green card he once held and homes in New York and Connecticut. He was also questioned in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. A call to an attorney associated with the Hamptons property was not immediately returned Thursday. Attempts to reach a representative for Vekselberg were not immediately successful.

That off-limits topic includes how the information he gathered \"related to his decision to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election,\" the judge ruled. \"The Court finds that this area of inquiry falls under the protection of the Speech or Debate Clause, which prohibits questions on legislative activity,\" Judge Leigh Martin May wrote in Thursday's order in U.S. District Court in Atlanta. But May rejected Graham's other arguments to either throw out the subpoena or sharply limit the questions that Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis' office can ask him. \"As to the other categories, the Court finds that they are not legislative, and the Speech or Debate Clause does not apply to them,\" May wrote. \"As such, Senator Graham may be questioned about any alleged efforts to encourage Secretary Raffensperger or others to throw out ballots or otherwise alter Georgia's election practices and procedures,\" the judge ordered. \"Likewise, the grand jury may inquire into Senator Graham's alleged communications and coordination with the Trump Campaign and its post-election efforts in Georgia, as well as into Senator Graham's public statements related to Georgia's 2020 elections,\" May wrote. Graham's challenge now goes back to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, where the senator filed an appeal after a previous ruling from Judge May denying his bid to quash the subpoena. \"We are pleased that the district court recognized that Senator Graham's testimony is protected by the Speech or Debate Clause,\" Graham's office said in a statement later Thursday. \"He will continue to defend the institutional interests of the Senate and the Constitution before the Eleventh Circuit.\" The order for Graham's testimony in Georgia's probe came one day after John Eastman, a pro-Trump lawyer who worked to overturn Biden's presidential victory, appeared before the grand jury and refused to answer questions. Eastman invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, as well as protections under attorney-client privilege, in refusing to answer at least some questions he was asked before the grand jury, his attorneys said. Rudy Giuliani, Trump's former personal attorney who was a leading voice challenging the 2020 election results, also recently testified before the grand jury."},

It was already known that the conservative advocate Ginni Thomas had contacted legislators in Arizona with a similar request seeking to undo Biden's victory there. The Washington Post first reported Thursday that she wrote two Republican legislators in Wisconsin, state Sen. Kathy Bernier and state Rep. Gary Tauchen, on Nov. 9, 2020, at \"virtually the same time the Arizona lawmakers received a verbatim copy of the message from Thomas.\" Bernier at the time was the chair of the state Senate elections committee. Thomas sent the emails days after Trump refused to concede the election to Biden, vowing, \"We'll be going to the U.S. Supreme Court.\" The subject lines of her messages read, \"Please do your Constitutional duty!\" \"Please stand strong in the face of media and political pressure,\" those emails said, according to The Post, which obtained them from the watchdog group Documented. \"Please reflect on the awesome authority granted to you by our Constitution. And then please take action to ensure that a clean slate of Electors is chosen for our state,\" Thomas wrote. Documented obtained the emails through a request under Wisconsin's public records laws. The group posted a copy of the emails online later Thursday. The report comes more than a month after Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., said the select House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, pro-Trump riot at the U.S. Capitol was considering issuing a subpoena to Ginni Thomas. Thomas sent the emails to Arizona and Wisconsin lawmakers via the online site FreeRoots, which provides pre-written messages that can be sent to multiple elected officials. Arizona and Wisconsin sent Biden electors to the Electoral College, as he won the popular vote in both states. The Electoral College then named him the winner of the 2020 vote. A lawyer for Thomas and a spokeswoman for the Supreme Court did not immediately respond to requests for comment from CNBC about her emails. Thomas' advocacy for conservative causes while her husband serves on the high court has generated controversy in recent years. Thomas sent 29 messages to Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows after the 2020 election encouraging him to pursue then-ongoing efforts to undo Biden's victory, CBS News reported in March. \"Help This Great President stand firm, Mark!!! ...You are the leader, with him, who is standing for America's constitutional governance at the precipice,\" she wrote Meadows on Nov. 10, 2020. \"The majority knows Biden and the Left is attempting the greatest Heist of our History.\" Several efforts to effectively overturn Trump's losses in battleground states ended up at the Supreme Court after the election. None of those efforts succeeded. In January, Clarence Thomas was the only Supreme Court justice to support Trump's request to block White House records from being sent to the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 riot. That riot began after Trump and his allies falsely claimed for weeks that he had actually won the presidential election and that Biden's victory was the result of widespread ballot fraud in states that included Arizona and Wisconsin. The violence disrupted a joint session of Congress for hours as lawmakers gathered to confirm Biden's Electoral College win."},

The president's remarks came after Idaho-based microchip manufacturer Micron announced plans Thursday to invest approximately $15 billion over the next decade in a new memory manufacturing facility in Boise. The lab, which is the first of its kind built in America in over 20 years, is projected to create 17,000 new American jobs by the end of 2032, according to the company. \"Today's announcement by Micron is another big win for America,\" Biden said in a statement. Micron President and CEO Sanjay Mehrotra thanked the Biden administration and members of Congress for bipartisan support of the CHIPS Act \"which made this investment decision possible.\" \"This is the first of Micron's multiple planned U.S. investments following the passage of the CHIPS and Science Act, and represents the largest private investment ever made in Idaho,\" Mehrotra said in a statement. \"Our new leading-edge memory manufacturing fab will fuel U.S. technology leadership, ensuring a reliable domestic supply of semiconductors that is critical to economic and national security.\" Over $52 billion was allotted to U.S. companies producing computer chips under the act, along with billions in tax credits to spur investments in semiconductor manufacturing to enable the U.S. to compete with East Asia. The region accounts for 75% of global production of semiconductors. Biden signed the CHIPS Act into law in early August. Micron first announced a $40 billion investment in memory chip manufacturing at that time. The investment, said the White House, will create 40,000 new jobs in construction and manufacturing and raise the U.S. market share of memory chip production from less than 2% to up to 10% over the next 10 years. In his statement Thursday, Biden also mentioned similar growth projections from manufacturing companies First Solar, Toyota, Honda and Corning over the past week. The announcements are a \"direct result of my economic plan,\" he said. Solar power company First Solar announced $1.2 billion in developments Tuesday, including a new factory in the southeastern part of the country and an expansion of its Northwest Ohio manufacturing footprint. The investments will add at least 850 new manufacturing jobs with the additional goal of supporting over 15,000 jobs by 2025, according to a press release. Vehicle manufacturers Toyota and Honda revealed a respective $2.5 billion additional investment in Toyota's North American battery manufacturing facility and a $4.4 billion joint venture with LG Energy Solutions to manufacture lithium-ion batteries in the U.S. that will power Honda and Acura EV models for the domestic market. Toyota's new venture will add 350 jobs, bringing total employment to approximately 2,100, according to a statement. A representative for Honda did not respond to a request for comment before publication. Corning, a New York-based advanced optics manufacturer, said Tuesday it is partnering with AT&T in a new optical cable manufacturing facility in Arizona. The facility will bring approximately 250 jobs to the area and is expected to open in 2024, according to a press release. \"In our future, we will make EVs, chips, fiber optics, and other critical components here in America, and we will have an economy built from the bottom up and middle out,\" Biden said Thursday. The economy has added 3.3 million jobs this year as the unemployment rate has fallen to 3.5%, tied for the lowest since 1969. For August, payrolls growth is expected to rise by 318,000 after growing by 528,000 in July. However, Federal Reserve officials have warned that their intentions to continue raising interest rates to combat inflation could raise the level of unemployment in the months ahead. \u2014 CNBC's Jeff Cox contributed to this article."},

Judge Aileen Cannon also will make public a status report by the investigation team probing the removal of documents from the White House when Trump left office in early 2021. But Cannon ended the hearing without ruling on a pending request by Trump to appoint an independent watchdog, known as a special master, who would review government documents seized by the FBI before the Department of Justice would be allowed to use the records to advance its probe. Cannon said she will rule later on that request, which Trump made in a lawsuit filed last month in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. Trump's lawyers had requested a more detailed list of documents taken from Mar-a-Lago than the less revealing inventory they have previously received from investigators. The DOJ is opposing the call for a special master, arguing that it will unjustifiably delay its criminal investigation. The Justice Department also has said that a review of the documents by a team of internal department watchdogs already has completed its own review and identified some records that would potentially be exempt from use in the investigation because they are protected by attorney-client privilege. In a separate ruling Thursday, Cannon said she will keep sealed a status report on that review by the DOJ's so-called filter team. Jay Bratt, the DOJ's top counterintelligence official, also argued at the hearing that Trump is not entitled to a review of the documents by a special master because \"he is no longer the president.\" \"And because he's no longer the president, he had no right to those documents ... that ends the analysis,\" Bratt said. Special masters, often drawn from the ranks of retired judges, are typically appointed in cases where there is a risk that some of the records seized by law enforcement should be barred from use in an investigation because they are protected by attorney-client privilege. Trump's lawyers, however, argue that some of the records could be protected by executive privilege that would result from him having been president at the time they were created. In a court filing Tuesday, the DOJ revealed that more than 100 classified documents were found at Mar-a-Lago, the private club in Palm Beach, Florida, where Trump maintains a residence, during the Aug. 8 raid. That discovery came two months after Trump's lawyers, in response to a federal grand jury subpoena, provided the DOJ with a sworn certification that a search of Trump's living quarters and office had not found records that were marked classified. Tuesday's filing said there is evidence that government records including the ones marked classified were likely concealed and removed from a storage room at that residence in an effort to \"obstruct the government's investigation.\" Authorities have said the National Archives and Records Administration tried for about a year after Trump left the White House in January 2021 to obtain documents it suspected were still in his possession. When Trump did give up 15 boxes of records from Mar-a-Lago earlier this year, they were found to contain highly classified material, leading to the opening of the DOJ probe, and eventually the Aug. 8 raid. Trump has argued that he declassified the records before leaving office. But whether or not the documents remain classified is irrelevant under the criminal laws that the DOJ is eyeing in the case, which include the espionage statute and obstruction of justice. By law, White House records must be turned over to NARA when a president leaves office. During Thursday's hearing, Trump lawyer Jim Trusty repeated an analogy that has become popular among defenders of the former president on the records issue. \"We've characterized it at times as an overdue library book scenario where there's a dispute \u2014 not even a dispute \u2014 but ongoing negotiations with [the National Archives] that has suddenly been transformed into a criminal investigation,\" Trusty said, according to NBC News. Trusty's claim omitted mention of a grand jury subpoena issued for the documents."},

The letter dated Friday from National Intelligence Director (DNI) Avril Haines to House Intelligence Committee chair Adam Schiff and Oversight Committee chair Carolyn Maloney also said the Justice Department and DNI \"are working together to facilitate a classification review\" of materials including those recovered during the search. Schiff and Maloney said in a joint statement they were pleased the government was \"assessing the damage caused by the improper storage of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago.\" Politico reported the letter earlier. The Justice Department on Friday disclosed that it was investigating Trump for removing White House records because it believed he illegally held documents including some involving intelligence-gathering and clandestine human sources \u2014 among America's most closely held secrets. Haines said DNI \"will also lead an Intelligence Community (IC) assessment of the potential risk to national security that would result from the disclosure of the relevant documents\" including those seized. The Justice Department on Friday released a heavily redacted affidavit that underpinned the FBI's extraordinary search of Mar-a-Lago in which agents seized 11 sets of classified records including some labeled \"top secret\" as documents that could gravely threaten national security if exposed. In the affidavit, an unidentified FBI agent said the agency reviewed and identified 184 documents \"bearing classification markings\" containing \"national defense information\" after Trump in January returned 15 boxes of government records sought by the U.S. National Archives. Other records in those boxes, according to the affidavit, bore handwritten notes by Trump. Schiff and Maloney said the Justice Department release Friday \"affirms our grave concern that among the documents stored at Mar-a-Lago were those that could endanger human sources. It is critical that the IC move swiftly to assess and, if necessary, to mitigate the damage done.\" The search was part of a federal investigation into whether Trump illegally removed and kept documents when he left office in January 2021 after losing the 2020 election to President Joe Biden and whether Trump tried to obstruct the probe. Trump, a Republican who is considering another presidential run in 2024, has described the court-approved search at the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach as politically motivated, and on Friday again described it as a \"break-in.\""},

The White House's hope is that it will remain a winning strategy two months out from the midterm elections which will decide who controls the House of Representatives and Senate. The trip marks his second visit to the critical swing state of Pennsylvania in three days. \"For a long time, we've reassured ourselves that American democracy is guaranteed. But it is not,\" Biden said. \"We have to defend it. Protect it. Stand up for it. Each and every one of us. That's why tonight I'm asking our nation to come together and unite behind the single purpose of defending our democracy regardless of your ideology.\" Democrats' odds of keeping their majorities in both chambers of Congress have brightened in recent weeks despite the mixed economic signals, as Republicans continue to receive blowback from the Supreme Court's decision on abortion overturning Roe v. Wade and investigations into Trump persist. An NBC News poll released last week found a majority of American voters, 58%, disapprove of the Dobbs decision and nearly the same amount, 57%, believe the investigations into Trump should continue. \"MAGA forces are determined to take this country backwards,\" Biden said. \"Backwards to an America where there is no right to choose, no right to privacy, no right to contraception, no right to marry who you love.\" Since Trump entered office, Biden has said the country faces \"a battle for the soul of the nation.\" The significance of the threat to democracy is underscored by Biden's choice of venue: Independence National Historic Park where the Constitution was penned. The same NBC News poll found that \"threats to democracy\" has overtaken the cost of living as the most pressing issue on voters' minds. Biden has amped up his criticism of Republicans recently, seeking to position Democrats as an alternative to a party led by extremists. Last week he referred to Republicans as \"semi-fascist\" for staying loyal to the former president. His remarks come against the backdrop of Trump's legal woes following the FBI raid on his Florida home Mar-A-Lago where the former president is accused of mishandling classified information."},

Agents found 43 of those empty folders marked classified in Trump's office, according to the Department of Justice's inventory of the seized items, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The remaining five empty folders with that marking were found in containers in a storage room. The FBI also found another 42 empty folders marked \"Return to Staff Secretary/Miliary [sic] Aide,\" during the Aug. 8 raid, which was authorized to search for government documents removed from the White House when Trump left office in Jan. 2021, the filing said. Twenty-eight of those empty folders were found in Trump's office, while another 14 were in a storage room elsewhere, the document shows. And FBI agents found more than 10,000 government documents and photographs without classification markings, the filing shows. Among those were hundreds of photos and news articles, along with gifts, clothing, and books. The bombshell revelations raise the prospect that the DOJ has not yet recovered the documents that would have been in the empty folders. The DOJ is investigating possible crimes related to the removal of those and other government documents from the White House when Trump left office in Jan. 2021. By law, such records must be turned over to the National Archives and Records Administration. On Tuesday, the DOJ said in another court filing that more than 100 classified documents were found at Mar-a-Lago. That property receipt noted that the government seized 11 sets of classified documents, as well as an executive grant of clemency regarding Roger Stone, a longtime Republican operative and Trump confidant. The previously disclosed property inventory of items seized lists multiple U.S. government documents with \"confidential,\" \"secret\" and \"top secret\" classification markings. The detailed inventory made public Friday was one of two court filings related to the FBI raid that were ordered unsealed by Judge Aileen Cannon after she conducted a hearing Thursday on a request by Trump's lawyers to appoint a third-party to review the seized records. The other document unsealed Friday is titled, \"Notice of Investigative Team of Status of Review,\" and notes that the criminal probe did not end with the raid. It was signed by Miami U.S. Attorney Juan Gonzalez, and Jay Bratt, the chief of the counterintelligence and export control section of the national security division of the Justice Department. \"The seized materials will continue to be used to further the government's investigation, and the investigative team will continue to use and evaluate the seized materials as it takes further investigative steps, such as through additional interviews and grand jury practice,\" that notice says. \"It is important to note, 'review' of the seized materials is not a single investigative step but an ongoing process in this active criminal investigation,\" the document says. Trump's spokesman in a series of tweets about the inventory of the seized items again criticized the raid. \"The new 'detailed' inventory list only further proves that this unprecedented and unnecessary raid of President Trump's home was not some surgical, confined search and retrieval that the Biden administration claims, it was a SMASH AND GRAB,\" wrote the spokesman, Taylor Budowich. \"These document disputes should be resolved under the Presidential Records Act, which requires cooperation and negotiation by NARA [National Archives and Records Administration], not an armed FBI raid,\" Budowich added. Trump in a lawsuit filed in late August asked Cannon to appoint an independent watchdog, known as a special master, to review the items seized in the search before the DOJ is allowed to continue using the documents in the investigation. Trump's lawyers have said a special master could check to see if some documents would be prohibited from being used in the probe because they are protected by either attorney-client privilege or executive privilege. The DOJ has opposed the appointment of a special master, saying that it would delay the investigation, and that Trump does not own the documents. Cannon, during a court hearing in Florida on that dispute Thursday, said she will issue a ruling on the special master request in \"due course.\" Cannon, a Trump appointee, previously shared her \"preliminary intent\" to grant Trump's request for a special master. The judge suggested in Thursday's hearing that she is still considering that appointment, news outlets reported."},

The former TV personality's vocal support for the energy business follows years of industry donations to his nonprofit and then his campaign, according to financial records reviewed by CNBC. Oz also has a personal stake in oil and gas through investments in two major energy companies, according to his financial disclosures. Pennsylvania's next senator will be a key vote for the energy industry, as it has a major presence in the Keystone State. Pennsylvania is the nation's second-largest natural gas producer after Texas and the third-largest coal producer, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Oz backed the energy industry this year as Americans felt the strain from spiking gas prices. In a recent interview, he ripped President Joe Biden after he called on companies that run gas stations to bring down prices at the pump. \"Now, they're blaming the energy companies for the gas prices. And I'm thinking, like most Americans, what are you talking about? I mean, you did things that make it, make it impossible for these companies to exist,\" Oz said in a July interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity. He called Biden's comments \"class warfare.\" As Oz champions oil and gas in his bid to represent Pennsylvania in the Senate, both his campaign and personal coffers have benefited from the industry and its executives. Oz, a veteran physician and television host, is running against Democrat John Fetterman for a Senate seat being vacated by Republican Sen. Pat Toomey. Oz is trailing Fetterman by just under 8 percentage points in an average of recent polls, according to RealClearPolitics. Fetterman's campaign has raised over $25 million, while Oz and his team have brought in just over $18 million, according to data from the nonpartisan OpenSecrets. Oz and his wife, Lisa, have a financial stake in the industry he has championed, as they own shares of oil and gas giants ConocoPhillips and Pioneer Natural Resources, according to their financial disclosure report. The filing notes they own shares of ConocoPhillips valued between $15,001 and $50,000 and Pioneer stock valued between $1,001 and $15,000. Oz's connections to the industry formed before he pursued politics. His nonprofit HealthCorps, which promotes itself as a group aiming to help teens with their health and wellness, has seen at least $210,000 in contributions from gas and oil producer Continental Resources since 2016, according to the group's annual financial reports. Continental's support has continued into Oz's Senate bid: The company's founder and chair, Harold Hamm, endorsed Oz for Senate in an April campaign video. The backing from energy industry leaders has led to contributions to Oz's campaign. Hamm is among a group of over a dozen oil and gas industry leaders who have combined to contribute over $200,000 to Oz's campaign since he announced his run for Senate late last year, according to a CNBC review of Federal Election Commission filings. Others with ties to the oil and gas business who have donated at least $2,900 to Oz's campaign include Jimmy Haslam, an owner of the Cleveland Browns and chair of Pilot Company, a business that owns fueling stations across the country. His father and Pilot founder, James Haslam II, also donated to the Oz campaign. Other top energy donors in recent months include Brad Cox, the chair of oil producer Cox Operating, and Janet Cafaro, the president of Silcor Oilfield Services, FEC records show. Jimmy Haslam and his wife, Susan \"Dee\" Haslam, combined to give $50,000 to the pro-Oz super PAC American Leadership Action. Jimmy and Dee Haslam told CNBC in a statement that they have \"tremendous respect for the long, successful career Dr. Oz has had in the private sector and appreciate that he now wants to serve his country by bringing his expertise and experience to the United States Senate.\" The Haslam family, as of 2015, had a net worth of $6 billion, according to Forbes. Representatives for Cox and Cafaro did not return requests for comment. Hamm told CNBC in a statement that he considers Oz a \"friend.\" He said the two have known each other for almost a decade, with the goal of bringing HealthCorps' services into Oklahoma schools. Hamm explained that he believes Oz will be a key advocate for the energy sector, which has enriched the oil billionaire. He and his family have a net worth of at least $21 billion, according to Forbes. \"Dr. Oz will champion American energy in the U.S. Senate much like he's championed health his entire career,\" Hamm said. The nonprofit's annual reports from 2016 through 2020 give a range of how much donors contributed to HealthCorps. Continental Resources regularly ranked among the Oz group's top backers. The company is often listed as donating between $50,000 and $99,999 during those years. A HealthCorps filing says it received a range of $10,000 to just under $25,000 from Continental in 2018. In its earlier filings before 2016, HealthCorps lists Continental as either a \"national\" or a \"community\" sponsor. The group's website notes that its national sponsors contribute $1 million and its community donors write checks for $250,000. The disclosures pre-2016 do not say or show a range of how much the company gave those years. Oz's support from the massive energy industry coincides with an apparent shift in his opinion on fracking, which allows companies to drill deep into the earth for oil and gas resources. Critics say that fracking hurts the environment by harming water supplies and polluting the air. Before Oz ran for Senate, he repeatedly wrote columns that took aim at fracking, noting its potential threat to public health, Vice reports. \"And in Pennsylvania, there are multiple reports of air and water contamination, possibly from hydraulic fracturing sites, causing folks breathing problems, rashes, headaches, nosebleeds, numbness, nausea and vomiting,\" Oz said in a 2014 column critical of fracking. Brittany Yanick, a spokeswoman for the Oz campaign, said the candidate has not changed his view on fracking and is a strong supporter of the drilling method. She also took aim at Fetterman's position on the issue. \"As a scientist, Dr. Oz understands that, like with COVID, the Biden administration is ignoring the science and the benefits of natural gas in order to satisfy the radical Left, the same liberal Democrats that are supporting radical environmental measures and funding John Fetterman's campaign,\" Yanick said in an emailed statement. \"John Fetterman has called fracking a 'stain' on Pennsylvania, he's called for a moratorium on fracking, and he would be a rubber stamp for the failing Biden Agenda.\" Fetterman has a mixed history with where he stands on fracking. Inside Climate News reported that Fetterman dropped his support for a fracking moratorium after his failed 2016 primary run for Senate. His position evolved after the state moved toward stricter regulations on fracking. Emilia Rowland, a spokeswoman for Fetterman's campaign, told CNBC that \"John does not support a ban on fracking in Pennsylvania and that includes a moratorium on new fracking sites.\" She said he hasn't taken any campaign money from the fossil fuel industry. \"John believes fully heartedly that we have to preserve the union way of life for the thousands of workers currently employed by the natural gas industry in Pennsylvania and the communities where they live. We can't just abandon these people, and tell them to go learn how to code,\" Rowland said in a statement. \"It's a total false choice that we have to choose between jobs and a clean environment. That's just not true. We can have both.\" Still, Oz appears more vocal than Fetterman in publicly supporting the oil and gas industry. In a recent op-ed, he said it's \"gross, and deeply unpatriotic\" for oil companies to charge high gas prices while their businesses are making massive profits. Fetterman namechecked Chevron, Exxon and Shell in the op-ed. Oz has rubbed elbows with industry officials during his campaign. He was invited to a June \"energy industry meet and greet\" by longtime lobbyist Missy Edwards. The invite says the meeting was set to take place at Edwards' offices in Washington. Her current clients include Southern Company and General Motors, OpenSecrets says. A spokeswoman for General Motors said she was \"not sure if GM had a representative in attendance.\" Edwards and a representative for Southern Company did not return requests for comment."},

It's not clear if that will last", "paragraphs": " The pace of new monkeypox cases reported in some major cities -- and in the US overall -- has started to slow recently, but experts say it's too early to know if the trend will last. On Friday, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said that she is \"cautiously optimistic\" about the downward trend, but warned that the overall case count is still growing. \"The rate of rise is lower, but we are still seeing increases and we are of course a very diverse country and things are not even across the country. So, we're watching this with cautious optimism,\" she said. Last week, there were an average of 337 new cases of monkeypox reported each day in the US, according to . That's a 24% drop from two weeks earlier -- a difference of more than 100 cases a day. A few factors are \"working together to bend the curve,\" Walensky said, including vaccination, behavior changes and harm reduction messages \"being heard and implemented.\" But many more factors are still in flux, leaving questions unanswered. Local health departments say they are working hard to understand the factors driving case trends. Washington, DC, has been an epicenter of the outbreak since the beginning; the city has had nearly 12 times more cases per capita than the country overall. The local health department has seen a \"slight decrease\" in cases over the past week, but said that \"education and vaccines\" are two key factors that will drive trends going forward. And \"with 100,000 students that will return to DC within the next week, it is too early to project the trends,\" they said. The California health department said that state trends over the last several weeks suggest \"stabilizing rather than increasing transmission levels\" and daily cases \"leveling off.\" \"The trend could continue but will depend on vaccination and behavior change as noted previously,\" they said. New York City Health Commissioner Dr. Ashwin Vasan said last week that the city has also seen \"cases begin to fall and transmission slow\" in recent days. Even if cases rise again, Donal Bisanzio, a senior epidemiologist with the nonprofit research group RTI International, predicts that there will be a \"rapid reduction\" at some point. Monkeypox \"is a disease that gives you full protection after you get it,\" he said. Reinfections aren't a factor. But no one knows for sure what's next. \"I think every public health response that I have ever worked, we want a crystal ball. It's just exceedingly hard to get there really early on, even for things that we have understood much better for years,\" said Janet Hamilton, executive director of the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists. \"Tell me when influenza season is going to end. I can't. \" Experts say that the ongoing outbreak is a rapidly evolving situation, making it difficult to know what to expect in the coming weeks and months. \"There is a very strong interest in using models and thinking about what the trajectories would be in different scenarios,\" Hamilton told CNN. All data-driven models require that at least some reasonable assumptions are incorporated. But with monkeypox, the United States is still collecting some of the foundational \"shoe leather epidemiology, boots on the ground pieces,\" Hamilton said. It's a \"highly infectious disease that's spreading very rapidly that we don't fully understand.\" Some of the stigma attached to the current outbreak may make people reluctant to seek medical attention, discuss recent contacts or come forward to get vaccinated, experts say. \"I'm always concerned about stigma and discrimination, as it can hinder trying to control an outbreak like this,\" said Dr. Wafaa El-Sadr, a professor of epidemiology at Columbia University who has researched HIV, emerging infections and other diseases. It could mean people aren't \"taking advantage of the important tools we have at hand to stop this outbreak.\" Generally, only about 15 to 25% of contacts are being identified, which can skew the understanding of the rate of disease spread, Hamilton said. \"That ends up being a very distinct challenge that then would directly impact what those models look like.\" While men who have sex with men have been disproportionately affected in the current outbreak, anyone can get monkeypox and a growing number of cases reported recently have been among women and children -- potentially changing the transmission map even more. And a recent shift in the federal vaccination strategy -- that potentially expands the existing vaccine supply by as much as five times, but poses other challenges -- marks a major change to another key forecasting factor. More than 1 million vials of the Jynneos vaccine have been allocated to states and other local jurisdictions, according to data from the US Department of Health and Human Services. However, only about 208,000 doses have been reported to the CDC as administered. In June, researchers from RTI International published that estimated the potential burden and duration of the monkeypox outbreak that did not yet have endemic disease. They projected that every three cases could cause 18 secondary cases if no prevention measures were put in place, with outbreaks lasting about six to nine months. Contact tracing and vaccination of close contacts could cut that risk by more than 70%, according to the model. But new knowledge and information has led them to adjust the model and rerun it, with updated estimates due out in a few weeks. \"We are talking about a model that was done just in the first month of transmission outside Africa. We were thinking that everything was going well,\" said Bisanzio, who is a co-author of RTI report. The model assumed that the public health response would be quick and effective, especially coming on the heels of the Covid-19 pandemic. \"We know that this story then evolved in a different way,\" he said, with a lag in response time, hesitancy around vaccination and transmission concentrated within one high-risk community that no one expected. \"I can tell you that the numbers (in the updated model) are much higher than the ones that we first estimated.\" That said, another one of the biggest adjustments to their model comes from a of men who have sex with men, in which about half of respondents said they changed their behaviors to protect themselves amid the ongoing outbreak. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington built an influential Covid-19 forecast model early on in the pandemic, but will not be doing the same for monkeypox. \"In our mind, this disease is not going to spread into the community as wide as we've seen with Covid,\" said Ali Mokdad, an epidemiologist and professor of health metrics sciences at IHME. There are some similarities to HIV that are concerning, but \"we don't see that being replicated here,\" he said, with monkeypox moving out of the body much faster and being much less deadly. While extensive data-driven models may be largely absent, experts say they are keeping a close watch on trends. \"You don't need a model to tell you that, at this point in time, the strategy has to be to identify those high risk individuals and vaccinate as many as possible,\" Hamilton said.

The US Food and Drug Administration has authorized updated vaccines that target the original strain of the coronavirus as well as the Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5. The hope is that these shots will improve protection against the currently circulating viruses that cause . Who should get these new shots? When will they be available? And why should you consider one? Here's everything you need to know about the bivalent boosters. These new bivalent vaccines carry instructions to help our cells make defenses against two strains of the virus that causes Covid-19. The shots direct cells to make antibodies that bind to certain parts of the spike proteins from both the original strain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron subvariants, which share an identical spike. BA.4 and BA.5 are the dominant variants in the United States, causing an average of 91,000 new infections each day. \"These are vaccines that are made, manufactured and delivered identically to the Covid mRNA vaccines that most of us have already gotten,\" said Dr. Gregory Poland, who leads the vaccine research group at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. \"In a sense, you've just changed the blueprints.\" Having twice the blueprints doesn't mean you're getting twice the dose of active ingredients, though. \"The total mRNA content -- the business part of the vaccine -- that leads to the immune response is the same amount,\" said Dr. William Gruber, senior vice president of vaccine research and development at Pfizer, which makes one of the updated vaccines. Pfizer's booster is a 30-microgram dose that contains 15 micrograms of mRNA against the ancestral strain and 15 micrograms against the BA.4 and BA.5 variants. It is authorized for people as young as 12. The company is also retooling its shots for children ages to 5 through 11 and will ask the FDA for authorization of those updated boosters in early October. It's working with the FDA to update vaccines for children ages 6 months through 4 years. Moderna's bivalent booster is a 50-microgram dose, with 25 micrograms of mRNA designed to fight the ancestral strain of the coronavirus and 25 micrograms of mRNA designed to fight the BA.4 and BA.5 variants. It's authorized for people 18 and older. The government has already been taking orders for these vaccines, and now that the FDA has authorized them, millions of doses will ship to tens of thousands of sites across the country. These include community health centers, health departments and pharmacies. As with past Covid-19 vaccines, these shots will be available free of charge. But they may be some of the last Covid-19 freebies from the government, which has said it's going to start commercializing treatments and vaccines this fall. Pfizer says it has the capacity to ship up to 15 million doses by September 9. The panel of experts that advises the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on its vaccine recommendations reviewed the science behind the shots Thursday and voted to recommend them. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky then signed off, meaning people can start getting the shots right away. \"What I'm expecting is, after CDC action, you'll start seeing some places start giving some shots in arms over the weekend, but very relatively few because [of the] Labor Day weekend. And my expectation is over next week, or certainly over the next 10 days, you're going to start seeing these bivalent vaccines become widely available across the country,\" Dr. Ashish Jha, who leads the White House Covid-19 Response Team, told CNN. The Biden administration expects appointment availability to ramp up over the first several days, with broad availability in a few weeks. People will be able to find locations at . The government is also preparing to launch a campaign that will urge Americans to get their annual flu shot along with an updated Covid-19 booster. Research on this approach suggests that it's safe. The updated Covid-19 inoculations will be the only game in town when it comes to boosters, at least for those 12 and up. The FDA says the older boosters are no longer authorized for this age group but will still be available as boosters for children ages 5 to 11. These are the first Covid-19 vaccines that will be authorized for use in people after being tested only in mice. This is much the same process that's followed each year when annual flu shots are updated. The FDA allowed companies to submit data from animal tests in order to speed these shots to the public. Studies in people are underway, according to Pfizer's Gruber. Dr. Peter Marks, who directs the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said he expects that it will be a month or two before data on humans is available. Officials say urgency with these boosters is warranted going into the fall, when Covid-19 is still circulating at high levels and influenza is expected to make a return. But the decision to rely on animal studies has generated some controversy. Some vaccine experts feel that animal studies don't provide sufficient evidence for these vaccines at this stage in the pandemic. \"You're asking people to get a new product for which there's no data,\" Dr. Paul Offit, who directs the vaccine education center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told CNN. \"Mice data are not adequate to launch 100-plus-billion-dose effort.\" Offit says it makes sense to use data from animal studies for updates to annual flu vaccines because we've used those shots for decades, and we understand what biomarkers to look for when gauging whether they work. These so-called correlates of protection are not as well understood for the Covid-19 vaccines. It's not just the shots that are different, Poland said. At this point in the pandemic, our immune systems are, too. Nearly all Americans have been infected with the coronavirus, vaccinated or both. Some people have had four or five doses of vaccine. \"So if you say to me, 'can you assure me that getting dose five or dose six of this new vaccine in the background of having received these previous doses is absolutely safe?' I'd say 'no, I can't.' We're extrapolating. And I think we ought to be clear about that,\" Poland said. FDA officials point out that animal studies weren't the only data they reviewed to make their decision. They considered two other lines of evidence. The first is the vaccines' track records. The same basic vaccines have now been given to hundreds of millions of people around the world. They have been shown to be extremely effective at preventing severe disease and death from Covid-19. Risks associated with mRNA vaccination are very, very low. The second line of evidence comes from bivalent vaccines that may soon be used in Europe. Earlier this year, Pfizer and Moderna presented an independent panel of experts who advise the FDA with data on a bivalent vaccine designed to target the original strain of Omicron, BA.1. That data showed that the vaccines boosted antibody responses and were well-tolerated. The UK has authorized these vaccines, but they will not be available in the US. The BA.1 strain isn't circulating any more, and the FDA asked the manufacturers to update their US shots to include BA.4 and BA.5 instead. Marks said in a briefing Wednesday that some evidence suggests that the BA.4 and BA.5 strains generate a stronger immune response than BA.1, which is another reason officials wanted to include them in the updated shots. FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said he understands that people may want to know more, but he's confident that these vaccines are safe and effective. \"It's fair for people to raise questions. But this really is the best consensus that we have among the experts that this is the best way to go. ... It's just painful to see people dying unnecessarily when there's a free treatment that would prevent their death,\" he said. \"I will be at the front of the line at the pharmacy getting my vaccination,\" said Califf, who will turn 71 next month. \"I'm very confident about this.\" In the past, tests of variant-specific vaccines have had lackluster results. It's hard to know what effect these bivalent vaccines could have. In a recent , published ahead of peer review, scientists tried to estimate this with a meta-analysis, or a study of studies. The gathered estimates of antibody levels after booster doses against the ancestral strains, as well as against specific variants, and tried to use those levels to predict how well the shots would work. They found that people got the biggest benefits from getting boosted, period. A booster against the ancestral strain of the virus that causes Covid-19 increased neutralizing antibodies 11-fold. The scientists estimated that would increase a person's protection against symptomatic infection over the next six months from 50% to 86.5%. Variant-specific boosters worked a little better, but the difference wasn't dramatic. After those shots, protection against symptomatic infection over the next six months rose to 90.2%, just a 4.6% increase. A of adverse events after mRNA booster vaccinations in adults the United States found that side effects were less common after booster doses than after second doses of the vaccine, and most were mild. About 1 in 8 adults reported a headache, fever or pain after a booster. In children and teens, after boosters were pain at the site of the injection, fatigue, headache and muscle aches. Very rarely, mRNA vaccines can cause myocarditis, or swelling in or around the heart. After more than 80 million booster doses given in the United States, the government safety surveillance systems received 37 verifiable reports of myocarditis. Most of these were in men. The highest rates of myocarditis in adults were in younger men -- ages 18 to 24. For every million booster doses given to men this age, the CDC expects about that about will have myocarditis. For adolescents, the rate is slightly higher but still extremely low: about for every million doses. Marks said that to minimize this risk, officials are directing that the vaccines be given at least two months after a previous dose. \"It seems to be associated when they're given closer to one another,\" he said. The Covid-19 vaccines were due for an update. As the coronavirus has been circulating, it has changed a lot. These changes have helped it slip past the antibodies that we made against older versions of the virus and older versions of the vaccine. As a result, it's gotten better at causing reinfections and breakthrough infections. Some of the monoclonal antibodies made to give people passive immunity against the virus have also stopped working against the new variants. The hope is that giving people updated vaccines will improve their ability to fight off the infection and shore up protection against severe disease that causes hospitalization or death. There is also some hope that updated boosters may slow the spread of the virus -- and thus the speed at which vaccine-busting variants appear. The coronavirus is changing at blistering speed. In a meeting with FDA vaccine advisers last June, Trevor Bedford, a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Reserach Center in Seattle, compared the speed of evolution of the viruses that cause Covid-19 to that of the viruses that cause influenza. Among the faster influenza viruses, he said, it takes about three years for a new strain to emerge and start showing up in testing in significant numbers. Among the variants of the virus that causes Covid-19, the Delta variant pulled off this feat in a year. Omicron did it in three to four months. So there is genuine concern that without something to slow transmission of the infection, we'll be forever stuck in catchup mode, waiting for faster and potentially more dangerous variants to emerge.

However, for more than 90% of patients on statins who experience muscle pain, the statin is not the cause of the pain, according to a published Monday in The Lancet and presented at the European Society of Cardiology Congress in Spain. \"Our results confirm that, in the majority of cases, statin therapy is not likely to be the cause of muscle pain in a person taking statin therapy,\" said the study, led by authors from Oxford Population Health and the Medical Research Council Population Health Research Unit at the University of Oxford. \"This finding is particularly true if the treatment has been well tolerated for a year or more before developing symptoms.\" The authors conducted a meta-analysis of 19 randomized double-blind trials of statin regimens versus placebos. All trials had over 1,000 participants and at least two years of follow up. They also looked at four double-blind trials of more and less intense statin regimens. Study author Colin Baigent, a professor of epidemiology at University of Oxford, said that there have been many non-randomized studies which don't involve any kind of placebo or random allocation to a statin that have produced \"really quite extreme\" estimates of how much muscle pain statins cause. \"This has put patients off starting statins, or made them stop treatment when they develop muscle pain because they simply look in the paper and they see that statins cause lots and lots of muscle pain and so they stop,\" Baigent said during a Science Media Center briefing. \"We were really trying to deal with that problem.\" The new study says that \"even during the first year of a moderate-intensity statin regimen, it is likely to be the cause in only approximately one in 15 patients who report muscle symptoms, rising to approximately one in 10 in those who are taking a more intensive regimen. \"In other words, the statin is not the cause of muscle symptoms in more than 90% of individuals who report such symptoms.\" The authors found that in the first year, statin therapy produced a 7% relative increase in muscle pain or weakness, but there was no significant increase after that. The increased risk was already present within the first three months after treatment was assigned. There were reports of at least one episode of muscle pain or weakness from 27.1% of patients assigned a statin versus 26.6% of those who had a placebo during a median 4.3 year follow up. In the trials looked at by the authors, they say that statin therapy, during the first year of use, caused approximately 11 additional muscle pain reports per 1,000 patients. \"What we conclude is that there are two things that we need to do as a profession, as a society,\" Baigent said in the briefing. \"The first thing is, we need to do a better job of managing patients who report muscle pain when they are taking a statin, because there's a tendency in patients to end up stopping the statin and that has a detrimental effect on their long term health. And the second thing we need to do is we need to look at the information that is available to patients in package inserts.\" He noted that if people were better informed about the real risks of muscle pains, then they might stay on statin therapy for longer. The study does have some limitations, including considerable heterogeneity in the methods used for muscle symptoms, some adverse event data not being available and most of the studies not excluding participants who may now be categorized as statin intolerant. In a commentary published alongside the study, Dr. Maciej Banach, a cardiologist at the Medical University of Lodz and Polish Mother's Memorial Hospital Research Institute in Poland, wrote that the possible side effects of statins shouldn't be a consideration when starting treatment. \"It should be strong emphasized that the small risk of muscle symptoms is insignificant in comparison with the highly proven cardiovascular benefits of statins,\" he wrote. The says heart disease is the leading cause of death for men, women and those of most racial and ethnic groups in the United States. There is one cardiovascular disease death every 34 seconds in the country. Last week, the US Preventive Services Task Force announced its latest guidance on the use of statins to prevent a first heart attack or stroke. The guidelines are more conservative than those put out by other groups, such as the American College of Cardiology. They recommend statins in adults 40 to 75 who have at lease one risk factor of cardiovascular disease and a 10% or high risk of a heart attack in the next 10 years. According to the , \"statins are recommended for most partients and have been directly associated with a reduction in the risk of heart attack and stroke. Statins continue to provide the most effective lipid-lowering treatment in most cases.\" CNN's Jen Christensen contributed to this report"},

Finance ministers from the G7 group of countries \u2014 the United States, Japan, Canada, Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom \u2014 said they would ban the provision of \"services which enable maritime transportation of Russian-origin crude oil and petroleum products globally\" above the price cap. That could block insurance cover or finance for oil shipments. The maximum price would be set by \"a broad coalition\" of countries, they said in a joint statement. It would take effect alongside the European Union's next batch of sanctions, which include a ban on seaborne imports of Russian oil starting in early December. Russia had already threatened to retaliate by banning oil exports to countries that implement a price cap. \"We will simply not supply oil and petroleum products to such companies or states that impose restrictions, as we will not work non-competitively,\" Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak told reporters Thursday, according to state news agency TASS. The Biden administration has been pushing for governments to introduce a price cap for months. The West has already , but Moscow has continued to earn billions of dollars a month by diverting oil to countries such as China and India. \"The price cap is specifically designed to reduce Russian revenues and Russia's ability to fund its war of aggression whilst limiting the impact of Russia \u0301s war on global energy prices, particularly for low and middle-income countries,\" the G7 finance ministers said. But the measure still needs work and will be extremely complex to manage. The price at which Russian oil will be capped still needs to be hashed out It would also need wider international support to be effective. \"What China and India do is going to need to be a national decision for them,\" a senior US Treasury Department official said on a call with reporters Friday. But if the cap forces Russia to strike cheaper deals with trading partners by putting a ceiling on the price at which they can sell their products, it will still achieve its goals, the official added. Novak has called the proposals to impose restrictions \"completely absurd\" and said they could destroy the global oil market, TASS reported. \"Such attempts will only destabilize the oil industry, the oil market,\" he said. Russia could offer alternative insurance for its oil shipments. But the US Treasury official noted they would be more expensive, raising incentives for buyers to opt in to the price cap system. Flows of crude oil and other oil products to the United States, United Kingdom, European Union, Japan and South Korea have dropped by nearly 2.2 million barrels per day since the start of the war in Ukraine, according to the International Energy Agency. But two-thirds of this decline has been rerouted to , helping pad Moscow's coffers. Export revenues in July were about $19 billion, the IEA said. Russia's control of large swaths of global energy supplies remains a major challenge six months since its invasion of Ukraine. This week, Russia temporarily natural gas deliveries to the region through a vital pipeline and cut off all supplies to a French utility, exacerbating problems that have sent European inflation to a record high of 9%. Russian state energy giant Gazprom said that the cut in deliveries through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline was due to a planned shutdown for a few days for maintenance work. It is supposed to reopen on Saturday."},

According to provisional data published Wednesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, life expectancy at birth dropped by nearly a year between 2020 and 2021 -- and by more than two and a half years overall since the . Life expectancy at birth fell to 76.1 years, the lowest it has been in the US since 1996, and the biggest 2-year decline in a century. Covid-19 was the driving factor, with deaths from the virus contributing to half of the decline from 2020 to 2021, according to the report from the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics. The death rate from Covid-19 was higher in 2021 than it was in 2020, so it wasn't particularly surprising that life expectancy would fall again, Bob Anderson, chief mortality statistician for the CDC, told CNN. Also, drug overdose deaths reached a record high in 2021, killing about 109,000 people. And deaths from unintentional injuries -- about half of which are due to drug overdose -- was the second-leading cause of the decline in life expectancy. Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, also said it wasn't surprising, but it is frustrating. \"It is distressing to see a continuing negative impact of drug overdose on the life expectancy of Americans. These deaths often occur in young adults and therefore represent a tragically high number of years of life lost and devastating impact on individuals, families, and communities,\" she said. \"We have the science and the tools available to help us reverse this trend and reduce the number of overdose deaths in this country. But these tools are not being used effectively.\" Even if expected, the scale of the decline is still extraordinary. In 2021, mortality rates due to influenza and pneumonia decreased, and if not for these \"offsetting effects,\" the decline in US life expectancy would have been even greater, according to the report. \"Mortality generally, mainly since the 1950s, has changed rather slowly,\" Anderson said. Changes of more than a few tenths of a year have been considered substantial. The recent decline among American Indian and Alaska Native people is particularly \"astounding,\" Anderson said. The life expectancy for this group plunged by nearly 2 years between 2020 and 2021 and a startling 6.6 years since 2019 -- more than twice as much as it did for the total US population. At 65.2 years, the life expectancy for American Indians in 2021 was equal to the overall US life expectancy in 1944. \"When I saw that, in the report, I just -- my jaw dropped,\" Anderson said. \"It was hard enough to fathom a 2.7 year decline over 2 years overall. But then to see a 6.6 year decline for the American Indian population -- it just shows the substantial impact that the pandemic has had on that population.\" Deaths from Covid-19 directly were the leading contributor to the decline in life expectancy among American Indian people in 2021, but deaths due to drug overdose and other unintentional injuries, as well as chronic liver disease, which is often caused by alcohol abuse, were nearly equal contributors for this group. When it comes to the pandemic, Anderson said, \"I'm not just talking about Covid-19 necessarily, but also the other factors that seem to have increased during the pandemic.\" Experts say the pandemic exacerbated already existing disparities for American Indians and others. Dr. Matthew Clark, a chief medical officer with the Indian Health Service, said the findings of the new CDC report are concerning, but it has been known that American Indian and Alaska Native people \"suffer disproportionately with regard to health outcomes for a broad variety of conditions.\" There are \"unique aspects to addressing health outcomes\" in these communities, he said, and this data should be viewed as a \"call to action, an opportunity to redouble our efforts\" to address a broad range of factors that impact the health of these populations and engage with tribal communities to find solutions. \"Even in the midst of a very concerning report like this, I do think that there's hope,\" Clark said, and \"there is an opportunity to move the needle in the other direction.\" To do that, the goal should be to explore the root causes of those disparities for American Indians and others, said Ruben Cantu, an associate program director with Prevention Institute, a nonprofit focused on health equity. \"A lot of the talk is going to be around the pandemic,\" Cantu said. \"But we need to think about what has driven the conditions that have allowed certain communities to be more vulnerable\" in the first place, like crowded housing, poor access to health care and low-income jobs that don't allow for paid sick leave. A , published as a preprint in June, found that the decrease in life expectancy in the US over the course of the pandemic was \"highly racialized\" and substantially larger than it was for a set of comparable countries. In fact, that study found that life expectancy increased slightly between 2020 and 2021 for the set of 21 peer countries. The new data from the CDC highlights differences in life-expectancy trends by race and ethnicity, as well as by gender. In the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic, life expectancy declined least among White people. In the second year of the pandemic, however, this group saw the second-biggest decline in life expectancy -- and deaths due to Covid-19 contributed to the drop among White people more than any other racial or ethnic group. Once the most vaccinated group, the share of the White population that is fully vaccinated with their initial series now lags behind that of the Black, Hispanic and Asian populations, CDC data shows. Life expectancy in 2021 was highest among both Asian women (85.6 years) and men (81.2 years), the CDC data shows. Hispanic women were the only other group with a life expectancy greater than 80 years. In the total US population, life expectancy fell more among men than among women in 2021, widening a gap that has been growing over the past decade. The disparity in life expectancy between men (73.2 years) and women (79.1 years) is now nearly six years. The life expectancy for American Indian men in 2021 was 61.5 years, lower than any other group. Black men had the next lowest, at 66.7 years. A recent project by the Prevention Institute focused on the mental health and well-being of men and boys. It found that men and boys of color -- especially Black and Native American men -- \"start out with higher rates of trauma and mental health challenges,\" Cantu said, which can make them more vulnerable to other conditions. \"Over the last five or six years, we've heard a lot more about diseases of despair -- things like substance use, alcoholism and suicide -- and a lot of those things are connected,\" he said. \"It helps to point out how vulnerable certain communities can be to a lot of other conditions.\""},

They have occurred in all 50 states and have been spotted throughout the year. While they are most common in the United States, tornadoes can occur all over the globe. While great strides have been made in the study of tornadoes, there's still so much we don't know about them. They have been studied immensely during the last few decades to learn what causes them and how they form. CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller, who is also a storm chaser, has been following and studying these storms since 2005. \"Something you learn from studying tornadoes, especially in the field, is that there is no perfect formula for forming a tornado -- every storm is unique,\" says Miller. \"Sometimes, it may appear that a storm is in a perfect environment for a tornado to form, yet it never does. Conversely, tornadoes frequently form in marginal environments where it seems like one or more 'ingredients' to storm formation is missing or lacking,\" says Miller. While there's no perfect formula as to which storms will produce tornadoes, there's commonality in the anatomy of the systems that result in tornadoes. There are even signs you can see that will help you understand the life cycle of a developing storm that could produce a tornado. As warm air rises, clouds begin to grow taller and taller. This is the developing phase of the thunderstorm. You can see fluffy white cumulus clouds grow taller with your own eyes. This is before you see rain or hear thunder. As the clouds grow, you will notice the bottom of the cloud darkening. You will many times see the very top of the cloud flattening out, creating an anvil shape that protrudes from the top of the cloud. This indicates very cold air at the top of the cloud and could be a precursor to the possibility of hail. As the storm matures, it could become what's known as a supercell. A supercell is a rotating thunderstorm. \"Nearly all supercells produce some sort of severe weather (large hail or damaging winds) but only 30 percent or less produce tornadoes,\" says the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. During this mature phase of the thunderstorm or supercell; heavy rain, lightning, hail and very strong winds are expected. Sometimes, you will feel a strong gust of wind a few moments before the rain arrives. This is called a gust front. This is caused by cool air being forced down from the storm cloud. When the cold air hits the ground, it spreads out quickly, ahead of the storm. This is a sure sign that a storm is near. Tornadoes are usually formed from supercells. These supercells develop when there are several ingredients in place to help them thrive: instability, lift and wind shear. Within the supercell, wind shear becomes a crucial component to the storms development. Shear is when winds change directions with height. This creates spin within the thunderstorm cloud. Another force that's acting inside the supercel is a downdraft. This is an area of drier air that is pushed down from the storm. As it's forced down, it wraps around the backside of the storm. The updrafts and downdrafts work in tandem to pull the horizontal column of air down to form the tornado. This vertical column of air is called a funnel cloud until it touches the ground -- at that point it becomes a tornado. \"The most telltale sign that a tornado could be forming, when you are looking at a close-range severe thunderstorm, is the 'wall cloud,'\" says Miller. The wall cloud is a lowering of the cloud base that will lead to the vortex, or spinning of air. When this rotating column of air touches the ground, a tornado has formed. The presence of a wall cloud doesn't always mean a tornado will form, but it certainly ups the odds. \"You will know you are looking at a wall cloud because it will hang noticeably lower than the rest of the thunderstorm and you may notice it is rotating if you look closely,\" says Miller. Most tornadoes are relatively small and short-lived, and can still be dangerous and cause damage. However, more violent tornadoes can be more than a mile wide and stay on the ground for more than an hour. This is because they have much more momentum than the smaller tornadoes, making them harder to stop. Miller has witnessed roughly 15-20 tornadoes during his years storm chasing. \"There is no denying that there is a certain amount of excitement that comes from seeing a tornado when you are set out with the intent of seeing one,\" says Miller. \"At the same time, you are balancing that excitement with a sizable amount of anxiety and concern over what the tornado could do, especially if there are residents in the immediate path of the storm. As someone who spent years studying, and many more years reporting on, tornadoes, it still gets all my nerves firing when you see a tornado in person.\" The smaller tornadoes have winds of 60-110 mph, while the more violent tornadoes can have winds from 160 to more than 200 miles per hour. The strongest winds ever recorded on Earth were from a tornado, on at more than  CNN's Jackson Dill and CNN meteorologist Haley Brink contributed to this report"},

But have you ever noticed hurricane hunters' flight patterns shown by meteorologists on TV look like random, odd shapes? Those flight patterns may look like boxes or stars, but they serve specific purposes for each individual storm. Hurricane hunters don't fly away from these storms like commercial airlines do. They fly directly into them, but they don't just fly into and around the storms randomly. There is a method to the madness. There are two distinctive groups of hurricane hunters, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the US Air Force Reserve (USAF). Both organizations fly missions into tropical disturbances in order to record invaluable data used by forecasters at the National Hurricane Center (NHC). For the Hurricane Hunters, there are two main types of missions flown, fixed and invest. Fixed missions are designated for systems that meet tropical cyclone qualifications, such as tropical depressions, tropical storms, and hurricanes. The main objective is to mark the center of circulation, monitor winds speeds and pressure changes, and other variables that are tricky for satellites in space to measure in full detail. For fixed missions, 'Alpha' is most common flight pattern used to collect data in a tropical cyclone. \"The Alpha pattern is the standard profile we fly for fix missions so it's the one people are most familiar with seeing from us,\" , meteorologist and aerial reconnaissance weather officer with the Air Force Reserve's , said. \"The pattern consists of two legs flown at intercardinal directions, and when complete, looks a lot like the Greek Alpha symbol when including the crossleg.\" Cardinal directions are the standard points on a compass: north, south, east, and west. Intercardinal directions are the diagonal points in between: northeast, southeast, southwest, and northwest. Interestingly, the bigger, stronger storms tend to be the \"easier\" ones to fly in. \"From my perspective as the onboard meteorologist, the Alpha pattern is the \"easiest\" to fly. Because we normally fly those on stronger storms, there's not a lot of question where the storm center is,\" DeHart said. \"The flights can be rough of course, but at the end of the day we just go fly through the storm center, collect the data, and send it to NHC.\" The primary objective of an invest mission is to determine if a system meets the definition of a tropical cyclone; storms that do not yet have a name or any real tropical structure characteristics. For invest missions, the NHC will often send estimated coordinates of where they believe the center of circulation is, which is where the missions will target for their starting point. However, invest missions by nature have to be a bit more flexible for flight patterns, simply because there are so many unknowns with these types of storms. \"We never know what we're going to find, yet we always have to be thinking two or three steps ahead. So that really makes us need to think about the meteorology [in each particular storm],\" DeHart said. \"Is it a closed low or an open wave? Maybe it's closed but just elongated? Is it battling shear? Are there several smaller swirls competing to be the main circulation center? Weak storms and invests can be very tricky and require a lot of thinking on our toes.\" Air Force Hurricane Hunters have a to choose from for invest missions: X, Delta, and Box, just to name a few. DeHart explains the missions are ideal for the weaker, more uncertain storms. While the X pattern may resemble the Alpha pattern, it is flown at much lower altitudes, usually around 500 to 1,000 feet. \"Once a system becomes a tropical storm or hurricane, the hurricane hunters begin flying at higher altitudes, ranging from 5,000 to 10,000 feet depending on the severity of the storm,\" said Jessica Kendziorek, public affairs operations chief with the USAF 403rd Wing. Flight levels for the Delta and Box patterns are usually at or below 5,000 ft absolute altitude. \"The Delta and Box patterns are similar in that we'll fly around the periphery of the forecast center seeing if we can observe winds in all four quadrants of the storm that would indicate a closed circulation. If we find a closed circulation, we can confidently go [find] the center; if not, we'll continue the mission in 'invest mode',\" DeHart said. NOAA Hurricane Hunters also fly operational fixed and invest missions (though the names may be different), but they usually have more research-oriented objectives. They fly many unique , with different types of aircraft, depending on what type of mission is assigned. Hurricane Hunters also fly a third type of mission, which the Air Force rarely flies, according to DeHart, called synoptic missions. For fixed missions NOAA often flies a Figure 4, Rotated Figure 4 pattern, or a Butterfly pattern. \"The Butterfly and Figure 4 patterns flown by the WP-3D through the storm are typically the ones used to [find] the center of circulation,\" said Jonathan Shannon, public affairs specialist for the NOAA Aircraft Operations Center Office of Marine and Aviation Operations. The Rotated Figure 4 pattern is as it sounds; the Figure 4 pattern turned on side. \"The goal with every flight is to gather data all around the center of the storm, and those patterns allow us to efficiently fly through a storm's various quadrants,\" Nick Underwood, NOAA Hurricane Hunter, said. \"This data helps with predicting a storm's intensity, as well as determining exactly where the center is.\" For invest missions, the Lawnmower and Square Spiral patterns are flown, to determine if there are actual tropical characteristics associated with the area in which they are investigating. \"The Lawnmower Pattern allows us to map out a large area when we don't have a center to aim for,\" Paul Flaherty, science branch chief at NOAA's Aircraft Operations Center, said. \"Once we are able to map a full circulation (usually by finding a west wind), we'll shift back to Figure 4's based on that newly identified center position.\" The Square Spiral pattern is a survey mission meant to supply observations on the structure and characteristics including information about the vortex center, if it exists. There is a unique third type of mission flight pattern, often used to sample the surrounding atmosphere which helps forecasters know the direction the storm is likely to go. The Star 1 pattern focuses on a scan of the outer edges of the system. The closely-related Star 2 pattern also does an outer scan of the system, while also adding in a circumference loop near the center of circulation. Recently, NOAA's Gulfstream IV flew a Star-2 pattern around Hurricane Larry, to investigate outflow patterns from the storm and better determine where the storm was headed. \"The flight pattern you'll typically see from our Gulfstream IV is a circumnavigation of the storm itself, as well as sampling of the atmosphere around and ahead of the storm,\" Underwood said. \"This data helps with predicting the storm's track.\" Regardless of which entity is flying, the operational missions are the backbone for the National Hurricane Center, tasked with providing essential life-saving information about a storm. The NHC takes the data and uses it to issue guidance and advisories to the public, so people know whether Elsa or Ida or Nicholas are still tropical storms or have become hurricanes. We ended 2020 with a 30 named storms in the Atlantic basin and if this season is anything like last year, we have a long way to go."},

Cayette, who uses a wheelchair, called parish officials for help. They never came. Parish officials, however, told CNN that they did not receive calls that match Cayette's situation, adding that the government is \"by law, not allowed to enter or conduct work on private property unless it is an emergency life saving measure.\" It wasn't until two days later when a group of volunteers from New Orleans came to saw and remove the trees that he was able to go outside. \"I've seen it all,\" Cayette, a retired industry worker, told CNN. \"After Hurricane Betsy in 1965, the chemical plants started building and operating. A lot of them. It all changed.\" About 50 miles away in St. John the Baptist Parish, Robert Taylor Jr., executive director of Concerned Citizens of St. John, said many residents were trapped in their attics after the storm while others witnessed their roofs being ripped off by Ida. The lack of after the hurricane, Taylor said, is just another example of the neglect the community has long suffered. Residents say the government failed to prepare the community for the storm by not issuing an evacuation order earlier or assisting poor and vulnerable residents who could not manage to flee their homes, like Cayette. \"The government is obviously failing us and not protecting us,\" said Taylor, who evacuated from St. John before Hurricane Ida hit. \"And this just pushed it over the top.\" The predominantly Black community of St. John and the nearly majority Black population of St. James sit at the heart of Louisiana's \"Cancer Alley,\" the 85-mile stretch between New Orleans and Baton Rouge that's home to more than 150 chemical plants and oil refineries. According to the Environmental Protection Agency's 2019 , \u2014 census areas that typically contain 600 to 3,000 people \u2014 with the country's estimated highest cancer risks are in St. John. Until recently, Cayette, who has lived in the region for 70 years and previously worked at a nearby petrochemical plant, never connected the growth of the chemical industry to the region's suddenly high cancer rates. But then his wife died of breast cancer a few years ago -- and he has been diagnosed with prostate cancer on top of his diabetes. Now, he lives alone with the sight of industrial facilities looming outside his window. \"I was mad and disappointed at the government,\" Cayette said about the lack of response after Ida. \"What concerned me even more is that I'm disabled, but they couldn't come to help.\" For decades, scientists have claimed the planet has been rapidly warming because of greenhouse gas emissions, particularly from the burning of fossil fuels. Days after Ida ravaged the homes of and Mississippi, the EPA concluding that racial and ethnic minority communities disproportionately suffer the most severe consequences of climate change, indicating they are the least able to prepare for, and recover from, extreme climate events such as pollution, flooding and heat waves. If the planet reaches the critical warming threshold of 2 degrees Celsius -- which most unless they drastically cut emitting greenhouse gases from fossil fuels -- the report warns that Black people are projected to face the worst impacts of the climate crisis. \"It's absolutely an insult that the companies that are responsible for this are also the ones that are driving climate change,\" Naomi Yoder, staff scientist at the Healthy Gulf, a group working to restore natural resources in the region, told CNN. \"They're also one of the biggest drivers of land loss in Louisiana, which makes the effects of hurricanes worse.\" The coronavirus pandemic has also hit both parishes especially hard. In April 2020, St. John had the highest death rate per capita for Covid-19 in the United States, surpassing even the most densely populated urban hotspots. Around that time in St. James, the Covid-19 death rate was also than the overall national death rate. More than a year later, with the pandemic persisting, Category 4 Hurricane Ida threw the area's high cancer and Covid-19 rates and underlying environmental health hazards, which come from the area's rampant pollution from fossil fuel industries, into harsh relief. \"It's just risk on top of risk on top of risk,\" Kimberly Terrell, director of community engagement at the Tulane University Environmental Law Clinic, told CNN. \"There's always air pollution coming out of industrial facilities, and these communities have been burdened with that for decades.\" The Rev. Lionel Murphy, pastor of Tchoupitoulas Chapel in St. John, said the storm left devastating damage to his church along with homes and other buildings in the parish, exacerbating the emotional and physical toll that air pollution and health disparities have placed on communities. \"If only we can get some attention,\" Murphy said, referring to public officials and emergency responders. \"The people are going to leave and come back, but this storm aggravates so much else because Covid is pretty strong in St. John.\" In the early months of the pandemic, Harvard's school of public health released a showing a link between fine particulate matter, also known as PM 2.5 pollution, and increased mortality rates from Covid-19. Terrell wanted to know what that meant for Louisiana, particularly in Cancer Alley. After scraping the raw data from the Harvard study and performing her own analysis, she found that the highest death rates from Covid-19 and a majority of PM 2.5 concentrations were in Cancer Alley. Ida added another layer of affliction by destroying houses and forcing residents to emergency shelters or relatives' homes, where they may be clustered together with potential for increased Covid-19 transmission. \"It seems like these communities are just continually burdened with risks that they didn't ask for, and don't deserve to be burdened with,\" Terrell said. The current 7-day average is more than 42 new Covid-19 cases per 100,000 in St. John and more than 177 new cases per 100,000 in St. James, according to . The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention categorizes St. John and St. James as a community with high levels of Covid-19 transmission. Taylor said he worries that residents who have been sickened by cancer as well as Covid-19 won't get the medical care they need after having to evacuate because of Ida's impacts. Some are being transported to shelters where they could potentially spread Covid-19 or even contract it, he said, echoing Terrell's concern. Prior to Ida, of residents in St. James Parish and St. John Parish were living below the poverty line, according to Census data. \"This is a mess,\" Taylor told CNN. \"I don't see how poor people are expected to survive this.\" The proliferation of petrochemical facilities and oil refineries throughout Cancer Alley has become a familiar sight to residents along the industrial corridor. Cayette said he remembers industrial facilities emerging after Category 4 Hurricane Betsy pummeled the region in 1965. But it was only recently that residents began to realize the invisible danger the industry caused on public health and the ironic effects it has on the climate. When a hurricane is barreling toward an industry-heavy region, petrochemical facilities and oil refineries typically begin to shutter their plants, which involves burning anywhere from hundreds to of hazardous materials. As part of emergency shutdown procedures, these facilities emit or burn various unprocessed chemicals and gases through a process known as flaring. Oftentimes, Yoder said, the emissions continue to escape even after the hurricane has knocked out power lines. \"This is not something new to these communities, and it's not necessarily even unique to a disaster situation,\" Terrell said of refineries emitting toxic compounds. \"It seems like consistently the people who are breathing these toxins are the last to find out about it.\" In St. Charles Parish, for instance, a Shell Norco manufacturing complex has been spewing residual gases as residents pick through the rubble of Hurricane Ida's aftermath. After the storm, the EPA contacted Shell about the excessive smoke and reports of noxious gas coming out of its refinery. In a report, that Shell is conducting \"community air monitoring\" and \"looking at all options to try to reduce emissions to flare.\" \"While the site is safe and secure, we are experiencing elevated flaring due to a lack of steam generation,\" Curtis Smith, a Shell spokesperson, told CNN. \"Crews are working around the clock to complete repairs and we are making good progress on minimizing flaring until power is restored.\" In St. James Parish, residents like Sharon Lavigne have been fighting new petrochemical plants attempting to set up shop in their community. Five years ago, Lavigne was diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis. Blood tests revealed that she had aluminum inside her body, which she later blamed on the slew of industrial facilities after attending a few environmental justice workshops. Angered by what she learned about the industry growing in her backyard, Lavigne founded RISE St. James, a faith-based environmental justice group trying to stop any new industrial development in Cancer Alley, which Cayette is also a member of. One of their was against the Taiwanese plastics manufacturer Formosa, which was set to build a in St. James Parish. Not only do Formosa's own that their mammoth facility could emit more of the cancer-causing compound than just about any other facility in the country, but their chosen location also happens to sit on two former 19th-century sugarcane plantations and a , according to a filed against the facility. \"My grandparents lived on this land. They bought this land and lived on it,\" Lavigne told CNN. \"And then when I got married, I built a house on this land.\" And while Formosa tried to push ahead with its construction during the pandemic, RISE St. James fought hard to block the company, delaying the construction further. The US Army Corps of Engineers early this year ordered Formosa to conduct a new environmental review of the petrochemical facility, thanks to legal complaints, protests and lawsuits like RISE St. James. While the battle to block the multibillion-dollar facility isn't over, Hurricane Ida added to the community's problems. The storm tore Lavigne's roof and caused her ceiling to collapse, just like it did to many other houses in the parish. \"So many of us suffered damages from Ida,\" Lavigne said, \"so after RISE members rebuild, we're going to help the rest of the community.\" Cancer Alley has faced many disasters, but none as challenging as a hurricane, air pollution and pandemic happening at once. To Cayette and Lavigne, living next to industrial facilities is a death sentence. It may take years for the community to recover, but Lavigne said they've been victorious before. As long as the fossil fuel industry continues to warm the planet and pollute their backyards, she said grassroots organizations will keep fighting. \"People tell me they're glad we're fighting the industry,\" she said. \"Many tell me they can't be out there to help me, but they're praying for me. That was nice.\""},

Is it quickest to get the train or the bus? What about a taxi or a city bike? Which provider has the nearest e-scooter? It can be inconvenient and time consuming. Which is why Finnish startup MaaS Global decided to aggregate all these services into one app called Whim. Available in more than 10 cities across Europe and Asia, users can access taxis, buses, bikes, e-scooters and rental cars. \"Whim's sole purpose is to compete against car ownership,\" CEO Sampo Hietanen tells CNN Business. According to the International Energy Agency, transport is responsible for , most of which come from . If Whim can persuade users to trade their car keys for a single app offering multiple transport options, the environmental impact could be enormous, says Hietanen. He admits this isn't an easy task. To succeed Whim has to be more convenient and cheaper than owning a car. \"The car represents freedom of mobility,\" says Hietanen \u2014 even if a city dweller barely uses it, they still keep it parked outside as a \"freedom insurance.\" To compete, Whim offers rental cars and taxis, but Hietanen says that users tend to opt for public transport or micromobility (shared lightweight vehicles such as bikes or e-scooters). Users can choose between multiple tiers of service, including a pay-as-you-go option and a 30-day season ticket, which costs \u20ac62 ($73) in Helsinki \u2014 where the app is most established \u2014 for unlimited public transport and short taxi rides. The ticket also offers car rental from \u20ac55 ($65) per day. While Helsinki has well-developed alternatives to driving, that's not true of everywhere. If a city \"does not have a wide public transport system or a lot of rental cars or taxis in place\" then it will be difficult to convince people to give up their cars, says Maria Kamargianni, associate professor of transport and energy at University College London. She says apps like Whim represent the first step in tempting people away from car ownership, and adds that the availability of alternative transport options is likely to improve as the market matures. Research firm predicts the global mobility service market will grow from $4.7 billion in 2020 to $70.4 billion by 2030. Other providers include Citymapper, which for Londoners in 2019, and Moovit, which launched an in Israel last year. Whim, launched in 2016, is one of the earliest providers and has raised more than $60 million from investors such as  ,  and Toyota Financial Services. It's available in several European cities and in Tokyo, and has racked up 18 million trips globally since launch. But the business has been hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, says Hietanen; with fewer people traveling, revenues are lower, stalling the company's expansion into other cities. Finnish newspaper recently reported that the company had spent \u20ac50 million ($59 million) on failed expansion ventures. Hietanen says the money was spent on integrating multiple transportation providers, establishing market readiness in several countries, and developing the complex technology that underpins the app. \"We've known from the beginning that the investment needed to create this would be substantial,\" he says, adding that the company has recently secured further investment. Though the industry is in its infancy, Hietanen is confident the demand will be there. A from the International Transport Forum (ITF) says that mobility services will be vital in meeting the needs of a growing world population and fast-paced urbanization. But for growth to happen, \"people must choose it over other travel options\" such as private motor vehicles. This is already happening, says Hietanen. According to a company survey carried out in Helsinki, 12% of its users said that Whim had prompted them to give up their cars. \"People want the more sustainable solution,\" he says, \"but they still want the freedom of being able to go anywhere, anytime.\""},

But despite covering more than of the Earth's surface, the ocean is still a relative mystery. In fact, we know more about the than we do about the sea floor; just over of the ocean bed has been mapped. Getting a fuller picture would enable us to navigate ships more safely, create more accurate climate models, lay down telecommunication cables, build offshore windfarms and protect marine species -- all part of what's known as the \"blue economy,\" projected to be worth by 2030. Underwater robotic vehicles equipped with sensors are helping gather that data quicker and more cheaply than ever before. But many of these vehicles rely on batteries with a limited lifespan, and need to return to a boat or the shore to recharge, making it difficult for them to map more remote parts of the sea. A five-year-old startup called is rising to the challenge, founded by oceanographer Yi Chao. While working at NASA, he developed technology to power ocean robots by harnessing \"the naturally occurring temperature difference\" of the sea, Chao told CNN Business. The power module can be installed on existing data-gathering robots or Seatrec's own floating device. This dives a kilometer down to examine the chemistry and shape of the seabed, using sonar to create a map of the surrounding area. The robot returns to the surface to send back its findings via satellite. As the float moves between colder and warmer parts of the ocean, material inside the module either melts or solidifies, causing pressure that in turn creates thermal energy and powers the robot's generator. \"They get charged by the sea, so they can extend their lifetime almost indefinitely,\" Chao said. A basic float model typically costs around $20,000. Attaching Seatrec's energy system adds another $25,000, Chao said. But the access to free, renewable energy and the ability to stay in the water longer makes data gathering up to five times cheaper in the long run, according to Chao. He said the startup is making fewer than 100 devices per year, primarily for marine researchers, but the technology is easily scalable -- Seatrec's energy module can also be can be retrofitted onto existing mapping devices to extend their range. New technologies that can extend the reach of data-gathering devices are crucial for mapping more remote parts of the deep sea, according Jamie McMichael-Phillips, director of the Nippon Foundation-GEBCO . \"One of the huge challenges we have is quite simply physics,\" said McMichael-Phillips. \"Unlike mapping the Earth's surface where we can use a camera [or] satellites, at sea, light does not penetrate through the water column. So we're pretty much limited to using sonar systems.\" Launched in 2017, the Seabed 2030 Project has increased awareness about the importance of the ocean floor, and given researchers and companies a clear goal to work towards: map the entire seafloor by the end of this decade. Some companies, such as , are surveying the ocean from the surface. Another startup, Bedrock Ocean Exploration, says it can provide surveys of seabed areas up to 10 times faster than traditional methods by using an autonomous electric submarine fitted with sonars, cameras and lasers; the data is then analyzed on Bedrock's own cloud platform. Even with the growing number of technologies accelerating seabed exploration, completing the map is still a logistical and financial challenge. Chao estimates that it would take 3,000 of Seatrec's floats operating over the next 10 years to fully survey the ocean. The company has raised in seed funding to scale up production of its energy harvesting system. But this is a drop in the ocean of the capital needed to fully survey the ocean, which is estimated to be \"somewhere between $3 to $5 billion,\" according to McMichael-Phillips -- \"pretty much the same order of magnitude as the cost of sending a mission to Mars.\" Bedrock's DiMare believes it's time we start investing in our own planet. \"If we want to keep Earth as a place that humans can live,\" he said, \"we have got to get a lot smarter about what's going on in the ocean.\""},

Twitter has accused Zatko, who worked at the company from November 2020 until he was fired this January for what Twitter says was poor performance, of pushing \"a false narrative about Twitter and our privacy and data security practices that is riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies and lacks important context.\" Zatko is a highly regarded cybersecurity expert with experience in senior roles at Google, Stripe and the Defense Department. His whistleblower disclosure was first reported by CNN and The Washington Post on Tuesday. In his disclosure to the US government, Zatko claims Twitter suffers \"egregious deficiencies\" in its cybersecurity posture, deliberately misled regulators about its handling of user data and that the company is not living up to its obligations under a with the Federal Trade Commission \u2014 a legally binding order that requires, among other things, the creation of \"reasonable safeguards\" to protect users' personal information. The FTC declined to comment on the disclosure. Zatko's damning disclosure alleges that roughly half of Twitter employees, including all its engineers, have excessive internal access to the company's live product, known within the company as \"production,\" along with actual user data. It also alleges the company lacks the ability to defend against insider threats, foreign governments and accidental data leaks. \"A fundamental engineering and security principle is that access to live production environments should be limited as much as possible,\" the disclosure says. \"But at Twitter, engineers built, tested, and developed new software directly in production with access to live customer data and other sensitive information in Twitter's system.\" Twitter has told CNN its FTC compliance record speaks for itself, citing third-party audits filed to the agency under the 2011 consent order. Twitter added it complies with relevant privacy regulations and that it has been transparent with regulators about its efforts to fix any shortcomings in its systems. Zatko did not participate in the audit work and did not fully comprehend Twitter's FTC obligations or how the company was fulfilling them, Twitter said. The disclosure claims Zatko's staff were \"intimately familiar\" with Twitter's issues before the FTC and that it was they who told Zatko Twitter was never in compliance with the 2011 order, nor on track to become compliant. \"We absolutely stand by the contents of Mudge's disclosure,\" John Tye, Zatko's lawyer and founder of Whistleblower Aid, the organization representing him, told CNN. Zatko may be eligible for a monetary award from the US government as a result of his whistleblower activities. \"Original, timely and credible information that leads to a successful enforcement action\" by the SEC can earn whistleblowers up to a 30% cut of agency fines related to the action if the penalties amount to more than $1 million, the SEC has said. The SEC has awarded more than $1 billion to more than 270 whistleblowers since 2012. Zatko filed his disclosure to the SEC \"to help the agency enforce the laws,\" and to gain federal whistleblower protections, Tye said. \"The prospect of a reward was not a factor in Mudge's decision, and in fact he didn't even know about the reward program when he decided to become a lawful whistleblower.\" The whistleblower disclosure comes months after the FTC that Twitter misused account security information for advertising purposes in violation of the 2011 order. Twitter in May to resolve those claims, in a second FTC settlement. Now, Zatko's disclosure raises the prospect of yet another possible violation of Twitter's FTC commitments \u2014 an extraordinarily dangerous position for a company and its executives to be in, according to Jon Leibowitz, who was chair of the FTC at the time of Twitter's 2011 settlement. \"If the facts are true, they would constitute violations of the order and of the FTC Act \u2014 and that would make Twitter a three-time loser,\" Leibowitz told CNN in an interview. \"There would be no reason for the FTC not to throw the book at them.\" Of course, Leibowitz added, the FTC would need to conduct a thorough investigation first to determine for itself whether a new violation has occurred. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, chair of the Senate subcommittee on consumer protection and a former Connecticut attorney general, said in a statement Tuesday that Zatko's disclosures \"reveal that responsibility for Twitter's security failures rests with those at the top.\" He further urged the FTC in a letter to investigate the allegations, saying officials should fine and hold Twitter executives personally accountable if it's found they were responsible for violations of the FTC Act or Twitter's consent order. The FTC's own credibility is on the line, Blumenthal said in the letter, which was also sent to the FTC on Tuesday. \"If the Commission does not vigorously oversee and enforce its orders, they will not be taken seriously and these dangerous breaches will continue,\" Blumenthal wrote. Under its charter, the FTC is authorized to prosecute \"unfair or deceptive business acts and practices.\" In the internet age, that has increasingly meant going after companies that claim to protect consumers' digital information but that in fact fail to live up to their public claims or misrepresent those protections. Twitter's original 2011 settlement arose from where hackers were able to compromise weak employee passwords and misuse their access to take over Twitter accounts and snoop on private information, in spite of Twitter's public statements on safeguarding user privacy and security. Twitter's settlement was not an admission of wrongdoing. But it Twitter to create \"a comprehensive information security program that is reasonably designed to protect the security, privacy, confidentiality, and integrity of nonpublic consumer information\" \u2014 a commitment Zatko alleges has never been met. As part of its latest FTC settlement this year, Twitter committed to even more granular cybersecurity obligations including having \"access policies and controls\" for all databases containing user data, as well as for systems that either grant employees access to Twitter accounts or that have information that \"enables or facilitates\" access to internal Twitter systems. Those obligations are already in effect following a judge's signing of the order this spring, further heightening the potential legal exposure for Twitter. Despite Twitter's mounting regulatory requirements, Zatko alleges not much has changed at the company since the FTC's initial complaint more than a decade ago. \"Things actually got meaningfully worse,\" his disclosure to Congress alleges. The disclosure claims that even as Twitter was actively negotiating the second settlement with the FTC last year, the company, in an entirely separate incident, allowed the very same type of misuse of data for advertising purposes to recur. In response to more than 50 specific questions from CNN related to the disclosure, Twitter did not address Zatko's allegation surrounding that incident. It did acknowledge that its engineering and product teams are able to access Twitter's live production environment provided they have a specific business justification, adding that members of other departments \u2014 such as finance, legal, marketing, sales, human resources and support \u2014 cannot. Twitter also told CNN that employee computers are automatically checked to determine whether they are up to date, and those that fail the checks cannot connect to production. The stakes of the disclosure could be hugely significant. An FTC finding that Twitter has violated its order a third time could result in the harshest penalties the agency has ever imposed on the company. The FTC is also currently chaired by Lina Khan, a and of what she calls a \"commercial surveillance\" industry that profits off of lax national privacy rules. Under Khan, the FTC is considering drafting that could directly affect companies across the economy, including Twitter, and how they collect, use and share personal data. Should the FTC conclude a violation occurred, it would have two main options for holding Twitter accountable, former agency officials say. It could seek a third settlement with the company, or it could sue Twitter over the existing consent orders and ask a court for appropriate penalties. In the case of a settlement, the FTC could even seek to name individual executives \u2014 holding them personally accountable and forcing them to accept obligations on their own conduct for which they could be held liable if they or the company violate the order again. If it turns out that Twitter did violate its legal obligations, Leibowitz said, the FTC should \"very seriously consider ... putting the executives responsible under order.\" The mere threat of naming individual executives can be effective, he added. During his time as FTC chair, Leibowitz recalled, \"I can't tell you how many CEOs came into my office saying, 'Please don't name me. I just don't want to be named. I don't mind if I pay more money; I don't mind if my company is put under a stronger order. But I just don't want to be named.'\" Megan Gray, a former FTC enforcement attorney who has worked on some of the agency's biggest privacy cases, said the tools at the FTC's disposal are numerous. (CNN spoke to Gray prior to Zatko's allegations becoming public and without disclosing their existence, and then again on Tuesday after CNN and The Washington Post reported Zatko's disclosure.) \"Escalating fines, more compliance reports, more granular controls and restrictions on their lines of business,\" Gray said, ticking off a list of options. \"Or a requirement to get advertisements pre-approved by the agency, or excluding them from certain types of transactions.\" Twitter has cited its third-party audits as evidence it has upheld its FTC commitments. But in general, the way the FTC's audit requirements often work in practice can let companies off the hook far too easily, Gray said. For example, many FTC orders are written broadly enough to allow a company to satisfy its obligations based on, among other things, \"attestations\" that they are compliant \u2014 a pinkie promise, Gray told CNN. In reports to the FTC, companies conducting third-party audits may simply say, or cite statements by the company under audit, that the company is in compliance. From 2011 until 2022, Twitter's consent order with the FTC allowed for audit reports based on attestations. Then, in its second settlement this year, the FTC made the audit requirements more specific, barring Twitter's third-party auditors from relying \"primarily\" on attestations by Twitter's management. Even with those types of restrictions, there are still reasons to be skeptical of FTC audit reports, Gray said. That's because third-party auditors are paid not by the FTC, but by the companies being audited, she said. \"So the incentives are completely out of whack for the auditing companies,\" Gray added. Twitter told CNN that audits are just one of the privacy and security programs Twitter has to meet its FTC obligations. Many current and former FTC officials, as well as US lawmakers and consumer advocates, have pushed to give the FTC more tools for holding businesses accountable, particularly after the Supreme Court last year the agency's ability to seek monetary relief under some circumstances. Some proponents of tougher oversight for example, letting the FTC issue fines to companies for first-time violations of the FTC Act. Currently, the FTC may generally only seek to impose civil penalties on a company In the case of Twitter, negotiating a consent order for a third time may seem like an odd look, another former FTC official said, speaking on condition of anonymity in order to speak more candidly. But in the event it finds a violation, and as with any case, the FTC will need to weigh what it believes it can obtain from Twitter through a settlement against what the agency may be able to win from a trial court. There are risks to long, drawn-out litigation, where a court may actually award the FTC less, the former official said. \"Some people do think these orders are kind of nothing,\" the former official said, \"but they're not. Maybe in some cases they are, and companies don't take them seriously. But in a lot of cases they do, and the FTC can exact a lot of pain. A lot of pain.\""},

Monday's suit targets Kochava, a marketing data company that lists major brands including Disney, McDonald's and Hilton among its clients. The FTC complaint alleges that Kochava failed to protect consumers when it publicly published samples of actual consumer data on Amazon's cloud services marketplace, and offered even more data to those who paid. In a statement Monday, Kochava said it has spent the past several weeks trying to explain its practices to the FTC, adding that it is currently rolling out a new feature called Privacy Block that \"effectively removes\" the sensitive location data from the data marketplace. The company's general manager, Brian Cox, accused the FTC of \"flamboyant press releases and frivolous litigation\" and said Kochava complies with all laws and privacy regulations. \"Unfortunately the only outcome the FTC desired was a settlement that had no clear terms or resolutions and redefined the problem into a moving target,\" Cox said. The suit comes amid mounting scrutiny of data brokers, tech platforms and other companies that handle consumers' location data generated by smartphones and other devices, as privacy advocates have warned new state laws restricting abortion could lead to abortion-seekers' location histories being used against them as evidence of wrongdoing. According to the FTC, Kochava's data had not been anonymized, so by combining its location records with data from other sources, it would be possible to deduce a person's actual identity based on the information Kochava was offering. In conducting the investigation that led to the suit, the FTC said it analyzed a Kochava sample set that covered more than 60 million unique mobile devices over the span of a single week. Kochava's data includes precise, timestamped latitude and longitude information for individual consumers, according to the complaint, which highlighted data linked to one specific person to illustrate how revealing the information can be. \"The data may be used to identify consumers who have visited an abortion clinic and, as a result, may have had or contemplated having an abortion,\" the complaint said. \"In fact, in just the data Kochava made available in the Kochava Data Sample, it is possible to identify a mobile device that visited a women's reproductive health clinic and trace that mobile device to a single family residence. The data set also reveals that the same mobile device was at a particular location at least three evenings in the same week, suggesting the mobile device user's routine. The data may also be used to identify medical professionals who perform, or assist in the performance, of abortion services.\" Under its charter, the FTC is authorized to prosecute unfair or deceptive business practices. In this case, the agency alleges that Kochava's data practices are unfair because the practices could cause harm to consumers they cannot avoid. In the wake of the Supreme Court's decision rolling back federal abortion rights this year, the FTC has signaled an increasing focus on protecting health-related data. Following a White House that called on the FTC to protect abortion seekers' privacy, the agency that it would hold data brokers and others accountable for misuse of data or mischaracterizations of data policies. Regulators at the agency are also mulling that could have sweeping ramifications for how businesses can collect, use and share personal information, including location information."},

While the Burgesses were charged before the Supreme Court overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that protected the right to abortion, the case highlights issues of digital privacy that could have widespread ramifications post-Roe. The teenager, who was about 28-weeks along when her pregnancy ended, told investigators she had unexpectedly miscarried a stillborn fetus and that she and her mother buried the remains, according to an affidavit in support of a search warrant. But police went on to serve Meta, Facebook's parent company, a search warrant. After roughly 300MB of data, including private messages between the two, authorities allege the 41-year-old mother helped her daughter obtain abortion medication in Nebraska, where abortions are illegal after 20 weeks. Celeste Burgess, who was 17 at the time of the alleged incident, will be tried as an adult. Attorneys for both mother and daughter declined to comment to CNN. On Tuesday, Meta spokesperson Andy Stone a statement on the company's website saying, \"Court documents indicate that police were at that time investigating the alleged illegal burning and burial of a stillborn infant. The warrants were accompanied by non-disclosure orders, which prevented us from sharing information about them. The orders have now been lifted.\" As much as Meta wants to , emphasizing that \"the warrants did not mention abortion at all,\" they still can and should do  to safeguard users' privacy. Instead, they've been (Stone said in a Twitter post that Meta had \"discovered some instances of incorrect enforcement and are correcting these\") and, according to a obtained by the New York Times, ordering employees not to discuss the issue of abortion in the workplace. Long story short: If big tech isn't going to protect women and girls, then we have to protect ourselves. That starts by obtaining -- and sharing -- knowledge about our digital rights. Like many of us, privacy experts on the court walls long ago, and repeatedly sounded the alarm about the of pregnant women, their abortion providers and anyone who assists them. With abortion bans and restrictions now in numerous states, prosecutors could increasingly rely on digital data to punish pregnant people for their choices. It's a catch-22: inaccessible health care and hostile abortion laws online to seek medical advice, financial support or transportation -- but these searches expand that can later be used to prosecute them. So what are the risks? In states where abortion is illegal, personal data can be from , like what happened to Burgess, or from a third-party data broker. Your period tracking app can flag a pregnancy before you're even aware, your texts and emails could provide incriminating evidence, and as more red states consider abortion , your location tracking data or electronic transaction records might reveal a trip to Planned Parenthood in a neighboring state -- and the government can use all of that data against you in court. Burgess's story is, tragically, one of many. Even before Roe was overturned, women's data was . It's particularly alarming that women and girls are targeted online when we are already at a to men when it comes to digital literacy. We know that American girls are to abandon computer science courses between the ages of 13 and 17. As they grow up, they're , and they are searching for online. It's no wonder that women comprise only a , and in those positions than their male counterparts. This digital gender disparity is why I founded Girls Who Code 10 years ago. Today, I'm proud to say we're on track to in new entry-level tech jobs by 2030. But that success doesn't just prove women and girls' appetite for STEM -- it offers a blueprint for the massive education effort needed to enhance young women's digital literacy and safety. Part of that effort must be learning and sharing the simple tips for safer online interactions: using encrypted communications apps like Signal, making phone calls via Google Voice, creating (and promptly deleting) new email accounts to coordinate appointments and transit. For the more complicated stuff, we should rely on and support nonprofits like , and , which mobilized to help us understand both technology itself and our rights using it. Over the past few months, they've assembled an arsenal of resources that specifically advise abortion-seekers about surveillance, providing them with best encryption practices and private internet browser recommendations. We can even consult the Department of Health and Human Services' new under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) for securing one's personal health data. We must urge our legislators to protect women's privacy by curbing abusive data practices and instituting stronger consumer privacy protections through proposed legislation like Sen. Elizabeth Warren's , or Rep. Sara Jacobs'  And if tech companies want to regain our trust, they must become . In addition to making end-to-end encryption the default setting in messaging apps, they can refuse to comply with requests for data that violate civil liberties, and even such data to protect our privacy. In all of this work, we must ensure digital privacy education reaches those who need it most. Historically, many , and have simultaneously  and are deprived of adequate healthcare, and other critical resources necessary for reproductive justice. We can't have true digital inclusion -- and justice -- if only some women can access this information. In Justice William O. Douglas' majority opinion in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), the court established the right to privacy -- and by extension, women's bodily autonomy -- within the \"penumbra\" of the Bill of Rights, that sliver of partial illumination between and \"full light.\" For so long, women and girls have had to assert our right to privacy -- in our phones, our homes and in our bodies -- in the shadows of the law and technology. By empowering women with a knowledge of our digital rights, we inch our way towards the full light -- where we have always deserved to be."},

His plans went awry", "paragraphs": " As Covid-19 wreaked havoc around the world last year, the 39-year-old son of an Indian billionaire was laying the groundwork for a plan he hoped would eventually end the pandemic. Adar Poonawalla \u2014 the CEO of Serum Institute of India (SII), the world's largest vaccine maker \u2014 pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into his Indian manufacturing facility and committed to make millions of doses of a then-unproven coronavirus vaccine. That vaccine, created by Oxford University and  , was still in clinical trials at the time. Nobody was sure how long a vaccine would take to develop, let alone whether it would even work. \"It was a calculated risk,\" Poonawalla told CNN Business. \"But I didn't see the choice at that time, to be honest. I just felt I'd regret not committing one way or another.\" To make his plan work, Poonawalla first had to raise nearly $1 billion. And the lives of hundreds of millions of the planet's most vulnerable people were at stake, since SII had pledged to provide poorer countries with jabs. If the gamble paid off, Poonawalla would save countless lives and be hailed as a hero during a period of historic turmoil. His fabulously rich family also would stand to grow even more wealthy by profiting from a significant deal. As the world gave its money \u2014 and trust \u2014 to Poonawalla, things seemed to be going according to plan. The AstraZeneca vaccine received approval from UK regulators in December 2020, and Poonawalla became a household name in India. But soon it became evident how badly Poonawalla had miscalculated the challenges that come with distributing millions of vaccines in the middle of a once-in-a-century pandemic. His company's ability to inoculate even his own countrymen was thrown into doubt earlier this year as a devastating wave of coronavirus hit India. He's also failed to keep up with his commitment to deliver shots to other nations \u2014 the consequences of which have dented his reputation and shed light on the perils of such heavy reliance on one manufacturer. It's easy to see why some of the biggest names in public health chose to rely on Poonawalla. Few manufacturers can come close to the scale at which SII is able to produce vaccines. The company \u2014 which was founded by Poonawalla's father, Cyrus, 55 years ago \u2014 produces 1.5 billion vaccines each year for measles, rubella, tetanus and many other diseases. The jabs are mainly distributed to low-income countries worldwide, including India. Poonawalla estimates that just over 50% of the world's babies depend on vaccines made at SII. The Poonawalla family charted an unusual path to becoming one of the world's preeminent vaccine makers. They have bred and raced thoroughbred horses since the 1940s, diversifying into pharmaceuticals, finance and real estate over the last half-century. Cyrus Poonawalla is now India's seventh-richest man, worth more than $16 billion, according to the His son Adar took over as CEO in 2011 and has focused on expanding in . To prepare for the AstraZeneca vaccine production, Poonawalla said he spent $800 million on buying chemicals, glass vials and other raw materials, as well as ramping up manufacturing capacity at his plant in the Western Indian city of Pune. More than $250 million came from the company's own funds. Another $300 million came from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which SII with to provide discounted or free doses to low-income countries. The rest was paid by other countries once SII started accepting orders for vaccines. In total, SII agreed to make up to 200 million vaccine doses for as many as 92 countries, as part of its deal with the Gates Foundation and Gavi, a vaccine alliance. All of that happened, though, before regulators signed off on the AstraZeneca vaccine. Had trials for that vaccine been unsuccessful, SII would \"just be making batches and then end up throwing them away,\" Poonawalla said. A business studies graduate of London's University of Westminster, Poonawalla said SII was able to make that decision more swiftly than many other companies, since it is a family-run business. \"The flexibility of being able to decide on the spot very quickly was really the main game-changer that enabled us to be able to do this,\" said Poonawalla, whose office in India is a refurbished . After the vaccine, Poonawalla began supplying doses to Indians and other other countries. By May, Gavi had received some 30 million jabs from SII. But Poonawalla's plans soon went awry when a second wave of Covid-19 hit India in the spring. At its peak the country was reporting over per day, though say the actual number was likely much higher. At that point, only percent of India's 1.3 billion population was fully vaccinated, and the country's national government had been slow in placing orders for more vaccines. Without a massive stockpile, states in India began to run out of the limited number of jabs they had. India then decided to the export of all vaccines, preventing SII from keeping up with its commitments elsewhere. \"I've always been a patriot for my country ... and if my country needs my facility first, I have to do what they say,\" Poonawalla said. \"There was no two ways about that.\" The inability to export vaccines hurt some of the poorest nations in the world. The director of Africa's disease control body, for example, warned India's hold on exports could be \" \" for the continent. People in several countries, from neighboring Nepal to , were left stranded after receiving the first dose of Covishield, the name of the India-manufactured vaccine. When asked why the global vaccine alliance chose to rely so heavily on one manufacturer, a Gavi spokesperson told CNN Business it had few options. At the start of 2021, \"very few vaccines were approved and available for deployment,\" the spokesperson said, adding that it was \"natural\" that SII would be contracted for early doses given its size. But public health expert Jeffrey Lazarus said there were flaws in the plan. \"Relying on one manufacturer was a mistake, which is easier to see in hindsight,\" said Lazarus, who heads the health systems research group at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health. While Poonawalla cannot be held responsible for some of the issues that led to the vaccine rollout stalling \u2014 chief among them, India's massive outbreak \u2014 his detractors have questioned parts of his approach. They point out Poonawalla hasn't delivered the number of jabs he initially promised, and they claim he hasn't been transparent about how he's been using all of the money he raised for the big vaccine push. \"There isn't much accountability for where the money he raised went,\" Malini Aisola, co-convenor of health sector watchdog All India Drug Action Network, told CNN Business. In June last year, it would make one billion doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine for low and middle income countries, with 400 million doses ready by the end of 2020. But by January 2021, the company had a stockpile of just . His critics weren't impressed, given the amount of capital he raised last year. The global media coverage also turned , with linking the global shortfall in vaccines to SII's problems, including the India export ban and a fire at the company's Pune facility. At the time Poonawalla said the fire had on Covishield production. But he has since saying that the incident has played a major role in hampering manufacturing. He also insists he was realistic about his goals. \"We always underpromise,\" Poonawalla told CNN Business, when asked whether the company pledged more than it could deliver. Still, he's been dogged by other controversies that have dented his reputation. As India's Covid-19 cases were skyrocketing in April, Poonawalla lowered the price of his vaccine and referred to the move as a \" \" \u2014 leading to heavy criticism, with activists pointing out that even a small profit is still a profit for SII. \"AstraZeneca has pledged that it won't from low income and middle income countries during the pandemic, but that does not seem to apply to SII,\" Aisola said. According to AstraZeneca, the companies the drugmaker has sublicensing agreements with, including SII, dictate their own prices. SII declined to comment on how much it has profited from the vaccine efforts so far, but Poonawalla said it is a \"very unreasonable and naive way of looking at the world\" for people to expect companies not to profit from the vaccine. While Poonawalla has yet to match his lofty goals, there is a chance that he and SII can get back on track, which is critical to ending vaccine inequality worldwide. India has decided to begin exporting vaccines once again as its own rate of inoculation increases. The nation had administered doses by October \u2014 about 90% of which came from SII, according to the company. SII also says that it has increased its production to 220 million doses a month as of October. SII is also expanding its partnerships, having signed a deal with American biotech firm Novavax to manufacture its Covid-19 vaccine, which is awaiting regulatory approvals. It's also partnering with the Russian Direct Investment Fund on production of the Sputnik vaccine."},

From data about which cell towers your smartphone has been communicating with to your specific GPS coordinates, your smartphone constantly gives off a tremendous amount of information on your whereabouts, the letters from AT&T, Verizon and other carriers show. For example, T-Mobile retains granular latitude and longitude coordinates of devices on its network for up to 90 days, and less-granular cell-site location data for up to two years, the company told the FCC in a letter dated Aug. 3. Verizon said it holds cell-site data for up to one year, while AT&T said it may retain cell-site data for up to five years. The company letters highlight how telecom companies, and cooperate with government requests for personal information \u2014 an issue that's received intense scrutiny in recent months as new state laws restricting abortion have prompted critics to cellular location data being used to prosecute abortion-seekers. In addition to sending official data requests to companies, government agencies have also resorted to simply buying personal data from the open market themselves, a practice US lawmakers have this year. That sensitive data, privacy advocates have said, can reveal whether a person may have visited an abortion clinic or sought other reproductive care, even if the location data was merely collected for the purposes of facilitating an unrelated call or mobile web search at the time. \"Governments collect information for many reasons. But, all too often, data collected by the state is misused and weaponized for other purposes,\" the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group, wrote in this spring. FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel didn't explicitly mention potential risks related to reproductive care or abortion in to more than a dozen top US wireless carriers in July. But the inquiries came less than a month after the Supreme Court's decision to overturn federal abortion rights in June, and amid heightened scrutiny of the many companies that handle location information and to law enforcement requests for that data in connection with abortion prosecutions. \"Given the highly sensitive nature of this data \u2014 especially when location data is combined with other types of data, the ways in which this data is stored and shared with third parties is of utmost importance to consumer safety and privacy,\" Rosenworcel wrote at the time. Last week, Rosenworcel added she has called on the FCC's enforcement bureau to investigate whether wireless carriers are doing enough to tell customers how their information is handled. There are many reasons a wireless carrier collects location information from subscribers, the companies told the FCC. One main reason is simply to operate the network as consumers would expect. But there are other reasons, too. For example, FCC rules require that carriers provide detailed information to 911 dispatchers in an emergency, down to a device's likely elevation so that first responders can more easily locate someone in need if they are on the fifth floor of a building. Carriers also collect location data for purposes that don't directly relate to the provision of wireless services. Verizon, for example, told the FCC it may use location data as part of an offering to third-parties that can \"develop insights to help estimate traffic patterns during the morning rush hour or how many customers go to a retail store.\" AT&T told the FCC it may collect location information in order to serve subscribers targeted ads. While in some cases consumers may be able to opt out of this data collection \u2014 such as with AT&T's advertising program \u2014 they generally cannot opt out of having their location data shared with law enforcement, the carrier letters said. \"Like all companies, we are required by law to provide information to law enforcement and other government entities by complying with court orders, subpoenas, and lawful discovery requests,\" AT&T wrote to the FCC. \"In all cases, we review requests to determine whether they are valid.\""},

Now, Asia's third largest economy is ready for the next big frontier in tech: Coming up with a new generation of software companies like Zoom or Slack. The Covid-19 pandemic has forced business around the world to make huge investments in digital infrastructure, furthering the influence of companies providing software-as-a-service, or SaaS. Businesses spent an extra $15 billion per week last year on tech as they scrambled to create safe remote working environments, . SaaS companies provide web-based applications that take care of everything from how secure the software is to how well it performs. Some of the world's most well-known SaaS companies include  , SAP Concur and  , the American behemoth that owns . India's software-as-a-service industry could be worth $1 trillion in value by 2030 and create nearly half a million new jobs, according to a compiled by consulting firm McKinsey & Co. and SaaSBoomi, a community of industry leaders. There are nearly a thousand such companies in India, of which 10 are unicorns, or startups worth at least $1 billion, the report said. \"This can be as big an opportunity as the IT services industry was in the 90s,\" said Girish Mathrubootham, CEO of Freshworks, India's best-known SaaS company. It filed for an last month, joining a string of other unicorns that are going public this year. Freshworks was founded more than a decade ago in the southern Indian city of Chennai. Like Salesforce, it provides software to help companies manage relations with their customers. It's also India's oldest unicorn in the sector, having raised funds from investors such as Tiger Global and Accel, and has more than 50,000 customers. The company was last valued at $3.5 billion in a 2019 funding round, according to data firm Tracxn. Other Indian SaaS firms have found traction by focusing on niche businesses. , for example, is a unicorn that builds software for the spa and beauty salon industry. Of India's 10 SaaS unicorns, six reached that milestone in 2020, and investors around the world are paying attention. Last year, investors pumped $1.5 billion into Indian SaaS companies, four times more than in 2018 or 2019, according to the SaaSBoomi report. Investors are excited about SaaS because of the \"massive adoption\" of software over the last decade, according to Mohit Bhatnagar, managing director of Sequoia Capital India. While India is a in the global SaaS market, investors say the country could eventually dominate the sector because of two things: its vast pool of English-speaking developers, and the relatively low cost of hiring them. Thanks to the rise of India's IT industry, software engineering has become one of the most in the country. \"India actually has one of the largest developer communities in the world,\" Bhatnagar told CNN Business. Many of them have worked at some of the biggest global tech companies. Abhinav Asthana, the co-founder of Postman, pointed to his experience working as an intern at Yahoo in Bengaluru as instrumental in the decision to build his product. He came up with the idea to build a tool that would simplify the API (Application Programming Interface) testing process. An API is a programming code that defines how two applications communicate with each other, and Postman says it has made it easier for engineers to work together as they design and build their APIs. \"We saw how software was created at these global companies, and we saw API was a key problem,\" Asthana told CNN Business. Now, Postman is India's most valuable SaaS unicorn, with a valuation of $5.6 billion. The low cost of operating in India is a big plus. According to a report by  , the salary of entry-level developers in India is 85% less than their counterparts in the United States. \"If you are building a SaaS company in the US, it is better to have a million-dollar client rather than a $10,000-client because you need to pay for sales and marketing in that country,\" said Prasanna Krishnamoorthy, managing partner at SaaS accelerator Upekkha. \"When you are serving customers from India, you can have these small and mid-sized companies, as well as large ones.\" Most SaaS companies focus on global clients, similar to the strategy that was followed by India's IT giants such as TCS and  . Investors see this as a welcome change, since most of India's oldest unicorns \u2014 from Flipkart to Paytm \u2014 have focused primarily on the domestic market. Almost 98% of Fortune 500 companies use Postman's products, according to Asthana, while Freshworks' first client was based in Australia. SaaS firms are much better placed to go global than e-commerce companies like India's Flipkart, for example. They write software once, and then are able to use it multiple times. \"For a Flipkart you need billions of dollars [to grow internationally], but for a Freshwork you need much less capital to go global,\" said Mathrubootham, who is also an investor in Postman. This is because e-commerce firms require a ton of money to set up physical operations elsewhere \u2014 they have to hire delivery drivers, rent warehouses and buy inventory. Bhatnagar of Sequoia Capital said that Indian software entrepreneurs \"mastered\" the art of \"remote sales\" fairly early. \"Honestly, in this last two years, the whole world has had to understand how to do better remote sales,\" he added. Despite the euphoria, there are some hurdles Indian companies have to overcome before they can deliver on the $1 trillion promise. Indian engineers trained in the IT services industry may find it hard to develop the discipline required to build a product-focused company. In IT services, \"you are selling bodies and you say yes to everything the customer says,\" said Krishnamoorthy. SaaS companies, on the other hand, have to say no to 99% of [potential] customers, he added. And India's startup ecosytem is still relatively immature when compared to Silicon Valley. Despite the massive size of some homegrown unicorns, Mathrubootham said that the country does not have a \"global tech powerhouse product brand.\" But he hoped that future SaaS companies can change that. \"It is my personal dream to see India as a product nation,\" he added."},

Last month, Twitter's former head of security, Peiter \"Mudge\" Zatko, told Congress and federal agencies that the company's security practices pose grave threats to national security. As part of his disclosures, which were revealed by last week, Zatko claims that the company allows about half of its staff \u2014 which amounts to thousands of employees \u2014 access to critical controls, and one or more of them may be working for a foreign intelligence agency. He also alleges that the company does not adequately protect the security of user data, using servers with outdated software that are missing critical security features like encryption. What's more, he claims that he was discouraged from sharing the full extent of the company's security problems with its board. , of course, disputes the idea that it has big security problems. It told CNN that engineering and product teams can only access the production environment if they have \"a specific business justification,\" that employees use devices that IT and security teams oversee, and that if a device is running on outdated software, they can prevent it from connecting to sensitive internal systems. However, Twitter did not respond to questions about its alleged foreign intelligence vulnerabilities. A spokesperson told CNN that \"Mr. Zatko was fired from his senior executive role at Twitter in January 2022 for ineffective leadership and poor performance.\" The spokesperson also said, \"What we've seen so far is a false narrative about Twitter and our privacy and data security practices that is riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies and lacks important context.\" (Zatko contends that he was fired in retaliation for raising at the company.) This latest whistleblower report makes clear that social media platforms not only pose potential privacy risks to users, but also national security risks. Congress needs to urgently pass a law regulating what data social networks can collect, how they can share it, how they can store it, who can access it and under what circumstances. Lawmakers also need to give the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) a specific mandate to closely oversee social media companies' security and privacy practices. That would ensure that these companies follow any new regulations put in place. We simply can't trust them to maintain their own data collection and sharing and security standards. Consider the ramifications of a social media company's inadequate security protocols. If a company lacks proper safeguards to protect user passwords or employees' accounts, the accounts of legitimate sources such as high-profile people could be taken over and used to issue dangerous, even deadly, claims or directives. Recall that, in 2020, hackers took control of the Twitter accounts of people like Elon Musk, Bill Gates and Barack Obama to promote , and were tricked into forking over more than $100,000. The hackers accomplished this by targeting employees who had access to internal tools and were able to post the tweets. Further, if a company lacks protections against how many employees have access to user information and safeguards to ensure that employees and users aren't hacked, then hackers \u2014 or even employees \u2014 could gather sensitive information about users from their social media data and share it with foreign intelligence agencies. Gaining access to their passwords or private messages can reveal evidence of things like affairs or abortions that bad actors can use to try to blackmail them into spying. Does it sound crazy to think that a Twitter employee would sell user data to a foreign government? Just this month, a former Twitter employee was found guilty of giving private information about Twitter users to the government of in exchange for money. That's why it's critical for social networks to limit access to sensitive user information, store and share as little user data as possible, and take every possible measure to prevent hacks. Zatko's allegations suggest, at least at Twitter, this simply isn't happening. Such threats are too serious to leave to social media companies to manage on their own. We need legislation that strictly limits the number of employees who can have access to user data, prohibits the sharing of that data with third parties, and requires companies to take stronger measures to guard against hackings. Congress needs to step in urgently to help protect social media users \u2014 and the country \u2014 from the possibility of these kinds of breaches."},

But the 33-year-old hasn't regretted her decision \u2014 bitcoin's value has increased 15 times since then \u2014 and she continues to invest as much as 10% of her savings in cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin and ethereum. \"I find stock markets boring,\" she told CNN Business, adding that she enjoys the \"thrill\" and \"recklessness\" that comes with investing in volatile currencies. She is not the only one. India has seen a huge boom in cryptocurrency trading since the start of the pandemic, even though authorities in Asia's third largest economy have for years expressed concerns about digital currencies, and even Entrepreneurs in the industry told CNN Business that the country has the potential to become a crypto superpower, since it is one of the hottest internet markets in the world, with , and hundreds of millions more yet to come online for the first time. India ranked second behind only Vietnam last year in a list of countries seeing the fastest growth in cryptocurrency adoption, according to a report published in October by blockchain data platform Chainalysis. While the government does not keep estimates of how many people trade cryptocurrencies, industry experts have suggested that the country may now have more than . The growth is driven by younger investors \u2014 mostly under the age of 35 \u2014 and many of them are coming from smaller cities and towns, founders of two of India's biggest crypto exchanges told CNN Business. According to Sumit Gupta, CEO and co-founder of exchange CoinDCX, many Indian millennials have started \"their investing journey with crypto.\" While 20 years ago, their parents chose to invest in gold, these youngsters \"are more interested in having bitcoin as part of their portfolio,\" Gupta told CNN Business, referring to the fact that traditionally Indians chose to park their money in gold or savings accounts. is both an investment and a cultural habit in India, which is one of the largest markets for the precious metal, according to the . It also considered auspicious by Hindus and Jains, and plays a fundamental role in many religious ceremonies. Mumbai-based CoinDCX became India's first crypto unicorn last year, achieving a valuation of $1.1 billion after raising money from investors such as Coinbase Ventures and B Capital Group. The company says 70% of its 10 million users are between the age of 18 and 34. Data shared by rival firm WazirX tell a similar story. WazirX also has over 10 million users, and called 2021 a \" \" for crypto trading in India. The company was acquired by , one of the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchanges, in 2019. Over 65% of its users are under the age of 35, according to a recent company report, and it has seen a \"700% increase in the number of participants from smaller cities like Guwahati, Karnal, Bareilly, thereby signaling the growing interest from rural and semi-urban areas.\" Pritish Kumawat, a crypto trader from a small town in the western state of Rajasthan, said that he now finds conversations about cryptocurrencies in almost every tea shop in his area. Often, the most engaged participants are college students, he said, adding that bitcoin's massive spike last year has fueled the frenzy in India. In November, bitcoin was trading at a record high of , but it has since fallen to around $43,000. In addition to bitcoin, meme currencies such as dogecoin and shiba inu are also popular among Indians, the WazirX report added. Apart from investors from smaller towns, both companies saw an increase of more than 1000% in the number of women users on their platforms, albeit on a small base. Gupta said that participation of crypto by Indian women has seen \"a massive upside\" in the past 18 months and is \"fairly high, fairly healthy, relative to equity markets.\" The company's data shows that 15% of their overall users are women \u2014 which is the as well. The excitement over crypto is rising in India despite the country's on-again, off-again relationship with digital currencies. The central bank has long expressed concerns that cryptocurrencies can be used for money laundering and to finance terrorism. A cryptically worded proposal posted on the Indian parliament website last year even suggested the government was exploring plans to \"prohibit all private cryptocurrencies in India.\" This year, however, started on a more cheerful note for enthusiasts. , the Indian government announced it would impose a 30% tax on income from virtual digital assets, which many industry experts took as a sign that crypto trading won't be banned after all. The government also said it would launch a digital rupee in the coming months. \"Taxation of virtual digital assets or crypto is a step in the right direction. It gives much-needed clarity and confidence to the industry,\" Gupta said at the time of the announcement. Siddharth Menon, the co-founder of WazirX, told CNN Business that following the announcement, his platform saw daily sign-ups jump by over 50%. He also noticed rising interest among Indian developers and other professionals in joining the crypto industry. \"I'm getting LinkedIn messages\" from senior executives in India, who are now more optimistic about the business, he said. In the past, Indian exchanges have struggled to hire and retain experienced people due to the lack of clear regulations. But the Indian government soon put a damper on the mood, by clarifying that the cryptocurrencies are not yet legal in the country. \"I am not doing anything to legalize it or ban it or not legalize it,\" Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in parliament a few days after announcing the tax rate. \"Banning or not banning will come subsequently ... But I will tax because it is a sovereign right.\" \"I think the government is not entirely sure what it wants to do from a policy perspective,\" said Anirudh Rastogi, founder of tech law firm Ikigaw Law, which works with crypto exchanges in India. \"It knows where it wants to land broadly. It wants to find the right balance where it is not disconnected from the global progress in blockchain and other tech, but it wants to also address concerns regarding cryptocurrency.\" Rastogi added that the \"extraordinarily high\" tax on crypto is a short-term fix, which will also acts as a deterrent to many investors. \"This rate is typically used to tax activities that are not considered economically productive, such as lottery,\" he said. \"So this could be an indication that the government wants to make revenue, but it does not see crypto trading as economically productive.\" For equities, India applies a 15% short-term capital gains tax if shares are sold in less than a year, and 10% if sold after a year. Gupta hopes that the government makes up its mind soon. India, with its vast pool of developers and enthusiastic young population, could be a \"superpower in the next five to 10 years,\" in cryptocurrency and blockchain industry, he said. \"What is missing right now is a clear regulatory framework,\" he added."},

Bollywood celebrities including Priyanka Chopra, Richa Chadha and Farhan Akhtar are among those to have lambasted the commercial for Layer'r Shot, a brand of male fragrance, calling it \"shameful,\" \"disgusting\" and \"incredibly tasteless.\" Its controversial advert shows four men appearing to stalk a frightened-looking woman in a store before cutting to one of the men saying, \"We're four, there's one, who takes the shot?\" Only when the woman turns round does it become clear they are talking about the body spray -- which one of the men then takes from a store shelf and uses. The commercial caused a storm on social media, where critics including various celebrities blasted its innuendo as making light of rape. Many said the timing of the advert made it particularly insensitive, as it was broadcast just a week after a case in which a 17-year-old was allegedly raped by five men in the southern city of Hyderabad -- against women and minority groups across the country. \"This advertisement is clearly promoting sexual violence against women and girls and promoting a rapist mentality among men.

In an email to Twitter, the ministry said the videos were \"detrimental to the portrayal of women in the interest of decency and morality\" and violated the digital media ethics code. In a statement Monday, Layer'r Shot apologized for the television advertisement, saying it \"never intended to hurt anyone's sentiments or feelings or outrage any woman's modesty or promote any sort of culture, as wrongly perceived by some.\" The brand said it had voluntarily asked all its media partners to stop broadcasting variations of the advertisement from Saturday with immediate effect.

More than 4,800 Chinese companies listed in Shanghai, Shenzhen and Beijing have now released their earnings for the first half of the year. It was a bloodbath. As many as 53% posted a decline in net profit, according to data from Wind and Choice, two major financial information services in the country. That was almost as bad as 2020, when companies posted their worst earnings season on record as the country came to a during the initial coronavirus outbreak. Back then, 54% of listed companies saw their profit drop in the first six months. By another measure, though, the start of this year was worse. The number of companies reporting a loss hit a record high of nearly 900 in the first half. In 2020, about 780 lost money. An earnings crash in the world's second largest economy can ripple around the world. That's because Chinese companies are big buyers of commodities, technology and other products on the global market. \"We've already seen the impact,\" said Alicia Garc\u00eda Herrero, chief economist for Asia Pacific at Natixis, a French investment bank. Prices of oil and other energy commodities have retreated and semiconductor factories have started to see decelerating orders, she added. Experts blamed China's strict Covid curbs and a deepening crisis in the property market for the dismal performance of companies. \"The key reasons are mobility restrictions and a huge drop in sentiment associated with the demise of the real estate market,\" said Garc\u00eda-Herrero. Larry Hu, chief China economist for Macquarie Group, said the poor earnings reflected China's slowing economy, which was being dragged back by the real estate slump, the worsening Covid situation, and the weakening global economy. China has so far stuck with its , which often leads to strict restrictions on people's movement and of cities over a few cases. Travel to and from China is also limited. Shanghai, the country's financial hub of 25 million people, was placed under earlier this year. Since then, many other key cities have also tightened curbs on residents and businesses.

China's GDP expanded by just 0.4% in the second quarter from a year ago, the weakest performance since the start of 2020. Last month, several major investment banks slashed their forecasts for China's annual economic growth to 3% or less. Analysts are also concerned about that has swept across southern China recently, which had caused some provinces to shut factories to save power. \"Whether Beijing decides to start easing [zero-Covid policy] from March 2023, we expect the economy and markets to experience a difficult period, as people will be either disappointed about no real opening or be overwhelmed by a surging Covid infection,\" said Nomura analysts in a research report on Friday. China's most prominent tech companies are among those suffering. The second quarter marked an end to years of explosive growth with   for the April-to-June period.   For some other sectors of the economy, this year has already been the worst on record. Three of China's biggest airlines \u2014  ,  , and  \u2014 posted record losses, with a combined loss of 50 billion yuan ($7.2 billion) for the first half. They all blamed travel disruptions because of Covid curbs and a depreciating yuan, which has plunged 9% against the US dollar this year. A weaker currency hurts China's airline industry because it has to pay for imported aircraft, parts and fuel in dollars. The costs of servicing dollar-denominated debt also increases. Property developers are also among the worst performers so far this year, as the country's housing market has spiraled downward. The sector, which accounts for as much as 30% of its GDP, has been crippled by a government campaign since 2020 to rein in reckless borrowing in the industry. Property prices have been falling, as have sales of new homes. The crisis escalated in recent months, as thousands of disgruntled homebuyers threatened to stop paying their mortgages on unfinished homes, jolting markets and prompting businesses and authorities to take action to defuse the crisis. Country Garden, China's No.1 developer by sales, reported a 96% plunge in net profit in the first half, the most since its 2007 listing in Hong Kong. The company said it has been weighed down by \"forces beyond our control such as resurgence of the pandemic in various parts of mainland China and extreme weather, coupled with the downturn in the property sector.\""},

There are currently around two jobs available for every unemployed person, and as a result, employers have had to raise wages to attract suitable candidates. That sounds like a good thing \u2014 and it is for Americans who are facing higher prices on everything from groceries to rent. But the Federal Reserve isn't very happy about it. In order to fight inflation, it needs to cool the economy, and larger salaries do the opposite. Higher labor costs can also get passed on by companies to consumers, and that means higher prices. This inflationary cycle \u2014 pay more and then charge more \u2014 is exactly what the Fed wants to squash. That's why it's paying particularly close attention to wage growth, which . If growth had continued to accelerate, the central bank would have more reason to aggressively hike interest rates at its meeting later this month. But we're not out of the woods yet. Wage levels are still elevated for the year, up 5.2%. There are a number of factors that add to higher prices \u2014 including supply chain and commodity pressures \u2014 but wages are the dominant driver of inflation moving forward, Aneta Markowska, chief financial economist at Jefferies, told me. \"Rising wages are creating a significant amount of inflation. Supply chain issues are expected to ease in the next year, but we're still left with this labor problem.\" The only way to get to the Fed's goal of a 2% inflation rate is to see wage growth decelerate sharply, she said. A 0.3% increase isn't enough of a deceleration. The US unemployment rate grew to 3.7% in August, coming in hotter-than-expected. The economy added 315,000 jobs for the month, topping analyst estimates of 300,000 but marking the lowest monthly gain since April 2021. Wage growth also eased to 0.3% for the month. Wall Street had expected a 0.4% increase. The Federal Reserve is looking for red-hot jobs growth to start cooling in its fight to ease inflation. The report lowered market expectations for a more aggressive interest rate hike at the Fed's September meeting, sending stocks higher. The numbers provided some relief from last month's jobs report, which blew expectations out of the water. More than half a million jobs were created, the most in five months. Average hourly earnings grew by half a percent month-over-month. In the weeks following the July jobs release, Fed officials took a more hawkish stance, saying that rate hikes would continue until inflation comes down and warning of upcoming economic \"pain.\" Fed Chair Jerome Powell cited the strong labor market as a cause of inflationary concern at . \"The labor market is particularly strong, but it is clearly out of balance, with demand for workers substantially exceeding the supply of available workers,\" he said. After the last Fed meeting in July, where the central bank raised rates by a whopping 75 basis points, Powell told me that he was closely monitoring wage growth. His ultimate goal, he said, was to bring inflation down and achieve \"a landing that doesn't require a really significant increase in unemployment.\" That's only achieved by slowing wage growth. Wall Street is currently pricing in . That's down nearly 15 percentage points since Thursday, before the jobs report was released. But there's still a lot of ambiguity around the Fed's upcoming policy decision. There's a lot of economic data to digest in the first half of this month -- in particular, inflation numbers for August -- and this is just one piece of a larger puzzle. \"The Fed will require further proof of softening before adjusting policy materially,\" said David Page, head of macro research at AXA Investment Managers. \"But on balance these figures are consistent with a 50-basis point September Fed hike.\" The US and China have finally come to an agreement on one of the biggest problems in global business: How Chinese companies listed on American exchanges should be audited. Regulators from both countries announced a deal last week that would allow US officials to inspect the audit papers of those firms. The breakthrough means that for now, more than 160 Chinese companies may have dodged the immediate threat of being kicked off the world's biggest stock market, . The US is wasting no time in getting started on those audits. Reuters reported Wednesday that officials picked  ,  and other companies for a first round of inspections beginning next month. US regulations stipulate that all companies on American exchanges must comply with requests to fully open their books by 2024 or they will be barred from trading in the United States. That's a problem for China. The country has been hesitant to let overseas regulators inspect its accounting firms, citing security concerns. The tension has already led some Chinese companies to retreat from US markets. Alibaba, whose shares have traded on the NYSE since 2014, outlined plans this summer to upgrade its Hong Kong listing to primary status, which it expects to take place by the end of this year. The long list of companies at risk goes beyond Alibaba and includes some of China's top tech giants like  , and  . The impending audit deadline has already led to a slowdown in share issues. US IPOs by Chinese companies have slumped significantly, with eight so far this year compared to 37 in the same period last year. The value of those deals has also shrunk. So far in 2022, companies have raised just $332 million through IPOs on US markets, down from nearly $13 billion a year ago. This deal is just a first step in formalizing audit protocol between the US and China. It's still unclear if China will actually comply. Last week, SEC chief Gary Gensler warned that companies still faced ejection if their papers could not be accessed by US authorities. \"The proof will be in the pudding,\" he said in a statement. Analysts at Goldman Sachs said this week that there's still a 50% chance of Chinese shares getting delisted. Either way, this isn't likely to have a big impact on other contentious issues standing between the US and China. But it does mean that China needs Wall Street. \"The US-China relationship reminds me of conflict-ridden relationships where at the end of the day, they realize they can't afford to get divorced,\" said Drew Bernstein, co-chairman of Marcum Asia CPAs, an accounting firm for Asian companies looking to enter US markets.

Apple has some famously loyal customers. Yet as broader economic forecasts get left and right, it might be a hard time to convince people to upgrade their iPhones. \"Apple faces a real conundrum of pricing,\" said Ben Wood, chief analyst at market research firm CCS Insight. On top of inflation and cost-of-living pressures wreaking havoc on consumers, he noted that Apple simultaneously faces rising costs associated with iPhone components and transportation. \"My expectation is that Apple will probably have to nudge prices up,\" Wood told CNN Business. But given the strain consumers are facing, he thinks Apple will also do \"everything they can to make that as minimal as possible.\" Beyond the broader signals of a worsening economy, Apple is also facing other headwinds as it prepares for the product launch next week. Supply chain hiccups stemming from China's zero-Covid policy were partly linked to the company's reported last month. Apple CEO Tim Cook said on the earnings call, however, that there was \"no obvious evidence of macroeconomic impact\" to iPhone sales. Cook added that the company even set a third-quarter record \"for both revenue and switchers to iPhone,\" adding that \"customers continue to find that iPhone remains the gold standard for smartphones.\" Steadfast iPhone sales are linked in part to other the predictions from some industry insiders that Apple will hike up the price of its newest iPhones -- though it is difficult to predict by just how much. Ming-Chi Kuo, an influential Apple analyst based in Asia, earlier this month that he expects Apple to raise the average selling price of the iPhone 14 lineup by some 15% compared to the iPhone 13 lineup. (Currently, the regular, non-mini, iPhone 13 starts at $799, the iPhone 13 Pro starts at $999 and the iPhone 13 Pro Max starts at $1,099.) In a research note Monday, analysts Dan Ives and John Katsingris of Wedbush Securities predicted that Apple would raise the price of its newest higher-end models by some $100. \"We believe a $100 price increase on the iPhone 14 Pro/Pro Max is likely in store given component price increases as well as added functionality on this new release,\" the note stated. The cameras on the upcoming iPhone Pro models are rumored to be upgraded to possibly justify the price increase, among other enhancements. The Wedbush analysts also predicted strong underlying demand for the next iPhone, estimating that some 240 million out of 1 billion iPhone users worldwide have not upgraded their phones in over three and a half years. Wood also noted that Apple's iPhones are in some ways insulated from macroeconomic pressures. Consumers are also increasingly looking at smartphones as \"almost essential,\" compared to some other tech gadgets. \"Whether you really need an iPhone or not, that's open to questions, but people who have an iPhone already are unbelievably loyal,\" Wood said. \"I think that Apple has some advantages over rivals,\" he added. \"There are people who are always waiting for a new iPhone.\" Apple, in its famously tight-lipped fashion during the the lead-up to its product launches, did not respond to CNN Business' request for comment Monday on the latest iPhone prices.

Competition is fierce in the video conferencing business, which means that there aren't any obvious buyers. And analysts say Zoom is still pretty pricey, even after the big stock drop.

Google owner  runs Meet and Chat.  likely wouldn't make sense as a Zoom buyer either. The company already has the ubiquitous video chat platform for its iPhones, iPads and Macs.

But what about other tech firms that still might want a bigger presence in video? Could Zoom be a fit for  ? The Facebook/Instagram/Messenger/WhatsApp owner could potentially get a further boost to its video aspirations by adding Zoom. How about  ? There's an argument to be made to combine Zoom with Slack, which Salesforce agreed to for nearly $28 billion, to create an uber-workplace productivity app that could compete even more effectively with Microsoft's Teams. The major obstacle to any deal could be Zoom's price. Joseph Bonner of Argus noted that although Zoom shares are well off their pandemic peaks, the company still would be tough to swallow \u2014 even for a megacap tech with tons of cash. \"A Zoom acquisition is unlikely due to a number of factors,\" Bonner said in an email. \"The thesis in favor of acquisition would be to pick up the asset on the cheap since it's lost so much value in the past year. Still at a $24 billion market cap, it's not that cheap and an acquisition premium would push that toward $30 billion or more.\" Bonner thinks that price tag would likely scare off any big tech buyers, as would the possibility of any potential deal getting a tough review from regulators in Washington. However, Bonner said there's a chance that Zoom could be bought by an investment firm so that it would no longer be subject to the quarterly earnings report whims of Wall Street. \"Think private equity. That could be a possibility,\" Bonner said. Others point out that Zoom is hardly the only tech/software company that is dealing with a post-Covid hangover. The Nasdaq has plummeted due to worries about rising interest rates and recession fears as well. \"I don't think it's accurate to say Zoom is uniquely struggling right now,\" said Morningstar analyst Dan Romanoff in an email. \"All of software has been battered over the last 10 months.\" Romanoff added that Zoom is \"an innovative company with a great product.\" The problem, he said, is that at the height of the pandemic, Zoom was \"generating an unsustainable revenue trajectory\" and the stock was \"sharply overvalued.\" That said, a deal could be possible. Romanoff noted that a Slack-Zoom combination could make sense. \"I thought a couple years ago that Slack and Zoom should merge because there is no need for standalone video, phone, and messaging products,\" Romanoff said. But he's not sure Salesforce would want to buy Zoom after already paying up for Slack, noting that Salesforce has \"maintained that [it is] not looking to do further large deals at this time.\" There is one other possible wild card though Business software company Oracle. \"Oracle doesn't have anything like this in their portfolio and they have been serial acquirers over the years,\" Romanoff said. But he still thinks an  deal for Zoom is highly unlikely because he's \"not sure that their balance sheet would allow them to do such a deal or that they are in the market at all.\" Romanoff added that if any tech company wanted to make a bigger bet on video, a cheaper way to do so would be with communications software firm  , which has a market value of just a little more than $4 billion. Zoom could also look to go back out and make a deal of its own if market conditions improve. That could help the company diversify. \"I am in the camp that Zoom is more likely to be an acquirer than an acquiree at this point,\" said James Fish, an analyst with Piper Sandler. Zoom had actually hoped to make a big purchase recently when it cloud call contact software firm  in July 2021.

Traders don't have a crystal ball to measure the level of risk when they make investment decisions. Instead they depend on the VIX, or the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index. Known as Wall Street's \"fear gauge,\" the index is supposed to reflect the market's estimate of future volatility \u2014 or how fast prices will change \u2014 30 days out. An elevated VIX means increased fear and risk while a low VIX means the market is entering a less stressful period. That's why the VIX tends to move in the opposite direction of the market. But as investors churn through increasingly choppy markets, some analysts are worried that this trusted measure of forecasting is broken. The gauge, they say, doesn't work in an atmosphere heavy with uncertainty, which is when traders most need it. The VIX is worthless in forecasting the direction of stocks, Aaron Anderson, senior vice president of research at Fisher Investments told me. \"There's just no correlation to future returns. We've never understood why so many people accredit so much to the VIX.\" Markets have tumbled over the last four days, bringing the recent late-summer comeback into doubt. The VIX is just now catching up to that, and only sort of. : Thirty is considered a high benchmark for the VIX. The index floated around 20 and below \u2014 which would indicate less volatility \u2014 for most of August. It hit 25 on Wednesday. In theory, if the index were to predict future market moves, it would have risen that high ahead of last week's selloff, Scott Bauer, CEO of Prosper Trading Academy who worked for 15 years as a market maker at the CBOE, told me. Cliff Asness of AQR Capital Management agrees that the index has limited utility: \"The VIX tells us almost nothing beyond how much markets have been bouncing around lately \" In an analysis dating back to the 1990s he found that the VIX was essentially in line with the S&P 500. By the time an investor looks back and determines a VIX peak or trough, said analysts at Fisher Investments, they've likely already missed the corresponding turn in the S&P 500. Sometimes there isn't any connection at all. Fisher analysts pointed to 1995 \u2014 a stellar year for markets that had no correlation to the VIX. The index wasn't designed to be as useful to retail investors as it is for institutions, said Bauer. There's a whole cottage industry of derivatives built off it. When the CBOE first created the VIX in 1992, it was intended to be a way for traders to make money by predicting market volatility. It wasn't supposed to become the major fear gauge it is today. In uncertain times, we like to cling to any future reassurances that we can, and the financial media certainly likes to use the VIX to that end. But when the unknowns are unknown, the VIX tends to break down.  had a very bad Wednesday. The company announced that it will lay off about 20% of corporate employees, close around 150 stores and slash several of its in-house home goods' brands in a bid to rescue itself from bankruptcy, . The retailer announced that it had also managed to secure more than $500 million in financing to shore up its long-term financial problems. The stock closed down more than 20% lower on the news. That's a big shift from recent weeks when the long-ailing company was adopted by so-called meme investors, who use social media platforms to organize large-scale stock purchases. The meme-induced hype lifted Bed Bath and Beyond's shares from less than $5 at the beginning of August to more than $30 during the middle of the month. It's been volatile since then. Shares of BBBY have either been the best or worst-performing stock in the S&P 1500 on nine out of the last 12 trading days, according to an analysis by Bespoke Investment group. Over on Reddit, meme investors who frequent pages like WallStreetBets appeared confused about what to do next. Some begged fellow Redditors to hold the stock, while others said it was time to let go. But it appears that even meme investors eventually got pulled down with the sinking ship. The company's moves on Wednesday were the \"prototypical rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic,\" said Berna Barshay, an independent retail analyst.

Air travel has been slow to adopt clean energy, but while the next generation of aviators waits for commercial airlines to move away from fossil fuels, it doesn't mean they can't train with lower carbon emissions. The Velis Electro, the world's only electric plane fully certified and , is taking off as a greener option for trainee pilots. Manufactured in Slovenia by Pipistrel, the Velis Electro is a two-seater light aircraft designed for flight schools. The single-engine aircraft can fly up to and has a maximum speed of (113 mph). It has a flight time of around 50 minutes (plus reserve) per charge, with two batteries that take to completely recharge. Tine Toma\u017ei\u010d, chief technology officer at Pipistrel Slovenia, says that while the Velis Electro offers a range of advantages over regular aircraft, a key attraction is that many of the fundamentals remain the same. \"You can literally take this airplane home and use it from day one for whatever you were using other non-electric powered airplanes for before,\" he tells CNN Business. As well as producing no carbon emissions in the air, the airplane is quiet \u2014 around says Pipistrel, which is . Toma\u017ei\u010d says that as a result, it can fly at much smaller airfields \u2014 which are often nearer to built-up areas and closer to prospective pilots \u2014 without annoying nearby residents. Since it was launched in 2020, Pipistrel says it has sold around 100 of the electric planes, priced at \u20ac175,000 ($175,500). With surging gasoline prices and increased scrutiny of the carbon footprint of air travel there is growing interest in the segment. in northern Sweden has three Velis Electros as part of its private and commercial pilot license training programs, which use sustainably powered planes where possible. Around 30% of the flying hours required for a commercial pilot's license take place in the electric aircraft, Johan Norberg, head of flight training at the academy, tells CNN. There is \"a huge difference\" in operational energy cost, he says, estimating a 40-minute flight in the Velis Electro uses $2 to $3 of renewable electricity, compared to roughly $45 of aviation gasoline for the same flight in a traditional single-engine training aircraft, like a Cessna 172, using a Lycoming O-360 engine. Pipistrel says batteries need to be replaced after around 2,000 flight hours (an indicator on the batteries says exactly when) and the price for a new pair is approximately $20,000. Even with the cost of replacing batteries, Norberg estimates the electric aircraft is cheaper to run than the academy's diesel counterpart, although he adds that \"the long-term operational costs are still to be verified.\" Training for a private pilot's license costs ($14,500) at Green Flight Academy, about the same as at flight schools that use conventional aircraft. \"When we can do a larger portion of training in electric airplanes there will be a significant cost cut to the whole training program,\" explains Norberg. In addition to shorter flights, qualifying for a private license requires pilots to undertake two-hour flights, says Norberg, which aren't currently possibly in the Velis Electro. But developing the next generation of electric aircraft with longer flight times could mean that within a few years, pilots might be able to train entirely without burning fossil fuel. Pipistrel was acquired this year by American conglomerate (owner of the Cessna and Lycoming brands), and is now part of . The global electric aircraft market is expected to quadruple , according to market research firm Precedence Research -- which estimates the value could reach nearly $40 billion by the end of the decade. The Velis Electro is currently awaiting approval for commercial use in the US by the Federal Aviation Administration, but it is already being flown privately. While trainee pilots are now getting the opportunity to fly green, large aircraft have yet to be weaned off fossil fuels, and zero-carbon long-haul and cargo flight is a way off. But Toma\u017ei\u010d is hopeful that won't always be the case. \"What (the) Velis Electro is already doing today is training the generation of pilots who will fly these large green aviation products of the future,\" he says. \"Not only is it representing a change in technology applied to training, but it is definitely changing the mindset of future pilots who inevitably will want to fly cleaner, electrified airplanes as part of their pilot careers.\""},

The crash occurred after the Cruise robotaxi making a left turn stopped in the intersection, thinking that an oncoming vehicle would turn in front of it. But the oncoming vehicle instead drove straight, striking the Cruise vehicle. Both the San Francisco police department and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration launched investigations. Cruise has said that the oncoming vehicle drove in the right-turn lane and was traveling at \"approximately 40 mph\" in a 25-mph lane before it exited the lane and proceeded forward. Cruise acknowledged in its recall filing that its robotaxi was not \"sufficiently reactive.\" Cruise spokeswoman Hannah Lindow declined to say what the Cruise vehicle could have done differently, and declined to release video of the crash. Nevertheless, Cruise said in a statement that it made the recall \"in the interest of transparency to the public.\" Cruise said in a document detailing the recall that it has already issued a software update that it says improves the robotaxis' ability to predict what other vehicles will do, including in conditions similar to the crash. Tesla, arguably a Cruise competitor in the long-term, has been criticized in the past for making software updates to its vehicles while not always issuing a recall. NHTSA has been more proactive on recalls of late and in a 12-day span earlier this year. Software updates like what Cruise did, often called \"over-the-air-updates,\" are generally to companies in the way traditional recalls have been, because there aren't costs for physical parts and the labor to install them. \"Automated driving developers are constantly revising their software, including to address potential safety issues,\" Bryant Walker Smith, a professor at the University of South Carolina law school who researchers autonomous vehicles, told CNN Business. \"It's to the company's credit that they treated this particular safety-relevant update as a recall under federal law.\" Cruise continued to operate its robotaxi service in San Francisco following the crash. But at some point after the crash, which Cruise didn't disclose, it disabled its vehicles' ability to make unprotected left turns and reduced the area where its robotaxis operated. Cruise has gradually reintroduce unprotected left turns since making the software update on July 6. An unprotected left turn is a turn where there is not a left-turn signal that indicates when it's a vehicles' opportunity to go. Unprotected left turns are generally considered one of the more challenging things that a fully autonomous vehicle performs. Waymo's robotaxis in Arizona, for example, to help minimize risks.

Photos have of a group of Cruise vehicles blocking lanes on a San Francisco street. Developing and operating robotaxis is extremely difficult and expensive. Cruise has added shareholders in addition to GM, including Honda, Microsoft and Walmart. Cruise lost $500 million in the second quarter of this year, according to GM financial filings. GM CEO Mary Barra that the market for robotaxis would probably be several billion dollars once robotaxis rides were available for $1 per mile, cheaper than human-driven Uber and Lyft's, which are often several dollars per mile and sometimes more. \"It's very much going to be a big part of how we move from point A to point B because it's safer,\" Barra told Fox Business.

The problem isn't only related to the Covid-19 border closures -- experts say the visa system was struggling even before the pandemic. \"I think the biggest issue at the moment is actually getting people into the country regardless of what the cap is,\" said Blair Chapman, director of Deloitte Access Economics. \"We're really competing on a global scale now with shortages reported all across the world and there needs to be serious thought given to how we actually attract people to Australia.\" Part of the problem is that hundreds of thousands of people are waiting for their visa applications to be processed, creating a disincentive for new highly skilled applicants who may have offers elsewhere. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says his new Labor government inherited a backlog of one million visa applications that officials are working to clear. \"Many of those (are) employees or potential employees who had agreements with employers for jobs ... and they have been waiting,\" he told CNN affiliate Seven news. At a jobs summit in Canberra, he committed 36 million Australian dollars ($24 million) to clear the backlog, but experts say the government could find itself in the same position as employers -- having too few workers to do the job. When the first cases of coronavirus were detected in early 2020, Australia shut its borders, restricting access to international arrivals so numbers didn't exceed the availability of hotel quarantine. Now, almost all Covid-19 restrictions have disappeared and from this week, positive cases only need to isolate at home for five days rather than seven. Australians barred from leaving the country are now racing for the border, and while more international visitors are arriving, the The lack of migration has created headaches for businesses -- forcing some to reduce their hours or services. Farmers can't find enough workers to pick their crops, hospital staff are working overtime, and construction workers are stretched thin across multiple work sites. \"It's across the board,\" said Zahan Mistry, the director of Easymigrate, a company offering migration and visa services. \"We're looking for people in IT, people in hospitality, in professional services, childcare workers, aged care workers, construction.\" Natureworks director David Joffe wants at least 10 workers for his sculpting business on the outskirts of Brisbane. \"Right now we're about to sculpt a giant 12-meter high cockatoo,\" Joffe said. \"We would love to build some horses here because we need some for Melbourne Cup day. There's also the lifecycle of a frog -- a series of 15 molds out there that we should be casting.\" But there just aren't enough people around to do the work. \"There are a couple of German backpackers living at Mount Glorious,\" he said. \"(But) everybody is grabbing them to try to get them to work on their house,\" he said. \"I'd love to get them, too, but they're busy.\" On the surface, Australia seems to be a strong option for skilled workers eager to relocate. The country's economy has rebounded from the pandemic and though the cost of living is rising, at 6.1% inflation is still lower than in the United Kingdom and the United States. Experts say Australia should be able to compete with Canada and New Zealand when it comes to skilled workers, but it doesn't. Australia's immigration policies are notoriously tough, but Mistry from Easymigrate said even for people with highly sought-after skills, the visa system can be frustratingly slow. \"It could take sort of eight to 12 months to bring someone in, so it becomes a big disincentive to businesses who are kind of looking for someone to start immediately,\" he said. Partner visas can take up to two years, he added. Mistry said the problems predate the pandemic, going back five years or so to when Border Force, the agency tasked with border control, was absorbed into a larger Department of Home Affairs. \"It seems to have been a very big culture shift from being about facilitating visas to one of more border protection,\" Mistry said. Australia's former Deputy Immigration Minister Abul Rizvi said around that time it became much harder for Australian employers to recruit foreign workers. \"What we did was make employer sponsored visas much, much, much more bureaucratic and made the processing of them very slow,\" he said. Rizvi said Friday's lift in permanent migrant numbers is positive, but it'll take time for the benefit to flow into the market. He said a sharp rise in student visa numbers could help fill vacancies in the short-term -- students have full work rights -- but he said in the long-term the country is \"going down the wrong path.\" \"We need to be selecting students who are interested in studying seriously and are able to study seriously, to complete a course employers value, and we'll give them a skilled job and a pathway to permanent residence. That's how the system works best,\" he said. \"At the moment, we're being sold by education agents around the world as the cheap work visa -- if you want to seriously study you go somewhere else.\" He said international students on low quality courses could find themselves stuck without a permanent path to migration because their qualifications aren't attractive to employers. On top of that, he said the processing system needs to get much faster. \"If you've got the world's best quantum physicist, you don't want to mess them around for two years. You want to get them quickly before somebody else grabs them.\""},

Fed officials, in particular, will be watching closely, as it is one of the last major economic data releases they'll have before their mid-September policy meeting. Here's what you need to know: Hold up \u2014 the Fed wants job growth? Seems counterintuitive, but, yeah. The Fed has a dual mandate to ensure maximum employment (which we have) and price stability (which we definitely don't have). And as Chairman Jay Powell reminded the world so bluntly in Jackson Hole last week, the Fed is going to keep raising interest rates (which makes borrowing more expensive, slowing business activity) until inflation relents. It's a long road ahead: Price surges are hovering around a 40-year high of 8.5%. The Fed wants to get that down to 2%. In effect, the Fed is wagering that the resulting pain of unemployment is less broadly harmful than the pain of inflation. Key quote: \"Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone.\" Of course, not everyone agrees with the Fed's strategy. Much of the root cause of inflation \u2014 supply chain disruptions, the pandemic, geopolitical tensions \u2014 are well out of the central bank's jurisdiction. Raising interest rates tackles the demand side (consumers will buy less) rather than addressing the supply side. \"What [Powell] calls 'some pain,' means putting people out of work, shutting down small businesses because the cost of money goes up,\" Senator Elizabeth Warren told CNN's Dana Bash last weekend. She's not wrong. Powell often euphemistically calls it \"softening of labor market conditions.\" What he means is higher unemployment, which means less consumer spending, which brings prices down. The Fed's trying to trade one kind of pain (inflation) for another kind of pain (unemployment). But Powell has repeatedly said that the labor market's strength is evidence the economy can handle higher rates. Of course, that's little consolation to the people whose jobs end up on the chopping block. A third three-quarter-point hike isn't a foregone conclusion. The Fed will have to weigh tomorrow's jobs numbers along with the results of the consumer price index, due out a week before the central bank's Sept. 21 meeting, to get a clearer view of the inflation puzzle. At least are on strike, including rail workers, lawyers, journalists and postal service staff, demanding higher pay as inflation soars to its highest level in decades. It's one of the most significant waves of industrial unrest in the UK since the \"winter of discontent\" in the late 1970s, when rampant inflation pushed workers to stage mass walkouts. Now for some not-terrible and relatively Musk-free news from Twitter, as a treat. It only took 800 years of pleading and begging but the Twitter gods have finally granted the world's request for a freakin' edit button. \"This is happening and you'll be okay,\" the company tweeted. (Ahem, AP style on that would be \"OK,\" instead of \"okay,\" plus it saves two whole characters! See, Twitter, everyone needs an editor.) This isn't a huge surprise \u2014 Twitter teased at it back in April, on the same day it announced Elon Musk would join its board (lol). (ICYMI, Musk accepted the board seat, then bailed a few days later. And then he offered to buy Twitter outright. And now he's in court trying to bail on that. Are you sensing a pattern?) The lack of an edit button has been an issue for as long as Twitter's been around. Facebook and Instagram have had it for years. Why, oh why, Twitter, did you make me suffer the public shame of my own misspellings and general carelessness? Apparently, some people worried about how editing could be weaponized, Like, say a harmless tweet goes viral and then gets edited to include harassment or misinformation? (To which I say, if you've ever to make a tweet go viral, you know how unlikely this scenario is. But I digress...) To avoid that misinformation potential, Twitter said tweets will be able to be edited \"a few times\" for up to 30 minutes after they are first posted. Edited tweets will appear with an icon, label and timestamp to make it obvious they have been modified, and users can click through to a tweet's \"edit history\" to see past versions. Good idea. Not to miss out on this trend, starting next week, Nightcap subscribers will get a version of the newsletter in which you can read all my terrible jokes and discarded takes that I cycle through every day to emerge with this still-imperfect-and-not-always-typo-free product.

The nation's unemployment rate rose to 3.7% from 3.5%, as more people entered the labor market looking for work, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday. The labor force participation rate ticked up by 0.3 percentage points to 62.4% but still remains below the pre-pandemic level of 63.4%. The August jobs report is among the key economic data the Federal Reserve will review when it meets later this month to decide how much to ratchet up its benchmark interest rate in order to stifle stubbornly high inflation. Thus far, the Fed has been battling soaring inflation While the economy is slowing and certain industries such as housing are showing softening amid a series of hefty rate hikes, the labor market has remained strong \u2014 a little too strong for the Fed's liking. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell the labor market is \"clearly out of balance, with demand for workers substantially exceeding the supply of available workers.\" Earlier this week, as the number of job openings hit 11.2 million in July, an increase of 700,000 from June, according to a separate report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Jim McCoy, senior vice president at staffing firm Manpower Group, characterized the current labor market as the eye of an \"economic hurricane.\" \"We have a calm center and lots of conflicting factors swirling around,\" he said. \"But effectively what we're seeing is that in spite of rising rates and supply chain issues that continue to plague [businesses], the jobs market is robust. There's a lot of pent-up demand for employees.\" Some of the biggest monthly employment gains in August came from professional and business services as well as the health care sector, which saw employment increase by 68,000, and 48,000 positions, respectively. The US economy has added an average of 438,000 jobs per month so far this year, after factoring in revisions that lowered June and July's employment gains by 107,000 jobs. \"I think it's reasonable to expect that we will not keep that pace up between now and the end of the year,\" said Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate. \"I think that we may well have seen the low for unemployment during this cycle.\" The average monthly job gains are robust, compared to pre-pandemic times when the monthly average was around 200,000, BLS data shows. But even the slower pace of August's increase would be considered acceptable to the Fed, said Brian Bethune, an economics professor at Boston College. \"I don't think the Fed wants to see things suddenly decelerate, nor do they want to see things move at too rapid of a rate for the economy to adjust,\" he said. \"What the Fed wants is the Goldilocks economy. They want it to be moving along at a steady pace \u2014 but not too fast; not too hot, not too cold.\" The strong labor market and job gains shouldn't be viewed as a net negative, Bethune said, noting that adding workers helps to ease supply-side constraints in goods and services. \"If the Fed goes and drives through the stop sign [by overcorrecting and spurring a recession], and we get a reduction in employment as a result, then we're going to get a reduction in supply \u2014 really not the right path to go at all,\" he said. This is the second jobs report released since the end of July, when the Fed's rate hike committee last met. Powell said last week that the central bank's decision in September will depend on the \"totality of the data and the evolving outlook.\" Among the biggest reports to land in the weeks to come will be the Consumer Price Index and Producer Price Index, which could help show the direction of inflation. The Fed is also closely monitoring wage growth, with Powell previously expressing concerns that continued gains could keep inflation elevated. Wage gains continue to be outpaced by the rate of inflation, The August report showed that the pace of average hourly earnings increased at a slower pace of 0.3% from July. That's the lowest rate of increase since April, for an annual growth of 5.2%. \"This is, no doubt, a welcome development for the Fed, but we shouldn't see this as a sign of an imminent Fed pivot toward looser monetary policy,\" Gregory Daco, chief economist for EY, wrote in a note Friday. Daco said that \"barring a surprisingly strong CPI\" reading, he anticipates the Fed will institute a 50 basis point increase at its meeting later this month."},

I've visited the Wall of Wind on the Florida International University (FIU) campus many times. It is a wall of enormous fans inside a big warehouse-type building that can blow air up to 160 mph, which would be a Category 5 hurricane, to test infrastructure and research the power of wind. However, in our changing climate, sadly, 160 mph isn't strong enough. So, the National Science Foundation (NSF) just awarded a $12.8 million Extreme Events Institute for the design of a full-scale testing facility capable of producing winds of 200 mph, along with a water basin to simulate storm surge and wave action in extreme winds. FIU will be able to build a house under the current building codes, start up the fans and see if it can withstand 200 mph winds. Will the roof detach? Will the house still be standing at all? The water basin will look like an enormous pool. It will also be able to simulate different coastlines. Storm surge tends to be worse when the coastlines are more shallow like along the Florida Panhandle. The facility will be able to simulate all of it. \"If you think about trying to future-proof, a changing hazard environment, a hazard scape, the US hazard scape with climate change, the past is not much of a guide. In fact, it can be deceiving,\" said Dr. Richard Olson, director of the Extreme Events Institute at FIU. \"So, if we're going to future-proof, we need to be able to research and test what future hazard events will look like. You can't future-proof in a changing environment if you're looking backwards.\" It's true. Climate change is showing us r, moving slower and are holding more water than ever before. They are also rapidly intensifying, meaning the winds are increasing at least 35 mph in a 24-hour period. In 2021, five hurricanes in the Atlantic rapidly intensified. And in 2020, TEN Atlantic hurricanes rapidly intensified. of those storms. \"Dorian in 2019 is the one that totally got my attention,\" said Olson. \"It hit 185 mph over the Bahamas, and until the last day and a half, it was heading straight up Eighth Street in Miami.\" Dorian ended up causing across Abaco and Grand Bahama. \"The scientific consensus is that we're going to see more intense storms, so we have to research and test for more intense storms,\" said Olson. \"Otherwise, nature's going to keep hitting us with harder stuff than we're ready for.\" The facility will be the first of its kind in the world to combine wind speeds of greater magnitude along with a water component. Eventually the facility will be able to test how different types of infrastructure, roads, bridges will all respond with a Category 6 storm. \"We can start putting all of these components together to get a much better picture of what nature is going to be hitting us with,\" says Olson. Yes, I realized I just referred to it as a Category 6 storm. And it might make some of you a little uncomfortable. To be honest, it bothers me a little bit too. But to be fair, if you look at the for the hurricanes, they are all -- more or less -- in about 20 mph increments. When a Category 5 hurricane's wind speeds start at 157 mph, and we see storms with maximum sustained winds of 180 mph, it's a number that makes me go pale. Since 2010, there have been 18 storms globally with recorded wind speeds of at least 178 mph at some point during their life span. and were two storms in the Atlantic to meet the threshold. It begs the question, especially for messaging purposes, do these types of storms need a special name? Category 6? Super-hurricane? Just something to put an exclamation point on how intense these specific storms are. But the truth of the matter is, most people who die in hurricanes don't die from wind, but from water. I reached out to my friend, Dennis Feltgen, the public affairs officer at the National Hurricane Center (NHC) about whether he thought there would ever be a day in our future we would see a Category 6, and here is what he had to say: I do agree with Dennis, but I also think as storms become stronger, wetter and slower, there might be a day the category system evolves from what it is now, just as the EF scale or Fujita scale was in 2007. And by the way, the same facility will also test tornado and thunderstorm winds. There are a few research facilities studying extreme winds. Watch below to see what 100 mph winds can do to a house. \"I think the interaction between the various components of hurricanes, the waves, the flooding, the currents, and the wind, the debris, all of that, it's very important to simulate that as practically as possible,\" said Dr. Arindam Gan Chowdhury, professor of environmental engineering at FIU. \"Everything is not possible to replicate Mother Nature. But the closer we can get, the better we can learn.\" FIU along with seven other universities will partner in this endeavor. Read the"},

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Prediction Center on Tuesday forecast 14 to 21 named storms, six to 10 hurricanes and three to six major hurricanes -- of Category 3 strength or greater. The 2020 and 2021 seasons both exhausted the hurricane name list and broke records. No one can say for sure if this year will be similar, but in early April, , which were right in line with what NOAA is forecasting. The CSU forecast called for 19 named storms, nine hurricanes and four major storms. After back-to-back years of using all the hurricane names and resorting to the Greek alphabet, the World Meteorological Organization decided to do away with using the Greek alphabet and to be used if all the hurricane names are exhausted once again. Of course it's impossible to know how many of those storms will make landfall along the US coast, or where the largest storms will develop. However, during the announcement, NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad recognized that the current hurricane cycle for the Atlantic is a busy one. \"If you go back two years, the 2020 hurricane season broke records across the board and it's the most active season on record with 30 named storms,\" said Spinrad. \"The 2021 hurricane season, which is the third most active year on record in terms of names of storms brought us 21 named storms with impacts, ranging from the Appalachian Mountains all the way to New England, resulting in over $78.5 billion in US damage.\" There are several contributing factors that play into a \"busy\" hurricane season. \"We are in an active period,\" said Spinrad. \"There are certain ingredients that drive the intensity and the frequency of hurricanes.\" One is the existing in the equatorial Pacific. This phenomenon creates cooler-than-average ocean temperatures around the equator in the Pacific and results in weather impacts around the globe. La Ni\u00f1a presents favorable conditions for hurricanes -- in contrast to that of El Ni\u00f1o. Hurricane seasons under El Ni\u00f1o conditions are known for upper-level wind patterns across the Caribbean that tear hurricanes apart as they try to form, making the seasons less active. Another reason for the above-normal forecast is the location of what's called the \"Gulf Loop Current.\" This current is \"a 600-foot-deep river of hot Caribbean water that travels between Cancun, Mexico and western Cuba into the Gulf,\" said CNN meteorologist Chad Myers. This loop current is flowing farther north now, forcing warm water at deeper levels of the ocean to travel closer to the coastal areas along the Gulf of Mexico. \"The warm water is simply too deep and the hurricane has an unlimited supply of hot water for intensification,\" said Myers. Forecasters are comparing the position of the loop current with where it was placed in the record-breaking 2005 season -- when Hurricanes Katrina and Rita both made landfall. \"Yes, the loop current does look like 2005,\" said Matthew Rosencrans, lead hurricane season outlook forecaster with NOAA's Climate Prediction Center. \"But it depends if a storm actually moves over that loop current and forecasting the specific track of storms is not something we can do beyond a week time frame,\" Rosencrans added. During the 2021 hurricane season, eight storms made landfall along the US Gulf Coast and in 2020 six made landfall along the Gulf. In 2020, and both slammed into southwest Louisiana, making landfall roughly 15 miles apart. \"In 2021, ripped through Southeast Louisiana, then caused more . \"Hurricane Ida spanned nine states, demonstrating that anyone can be in the direct path of a hurricane and in danger from the remnants of a storm system,\" said FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell. \"It's important for everyone to understand their risk.\""},
{"url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2022/03/14/weather/cloud-seeding-weather-modification-wxn/index.html", "title": "Scientists in the US are flying planes into clouds to make it snow more", "paragraphs": " With in drought, wouldn't it be nice if we could just \"make it rain\" or just \"make more snow?\" Well, certain parts of the country are doing just that, sort of. It's called cloud seeding, and it's nothing new. It's been around since the 1940s and countries all over the world have been doing it for various reasons , but it's a growing practice in the US, especially in the drought-stricken West. It's also surrounded with controversy. We spoke with Julie Gondzar who is the program manager for , who admits she gets lots of calls about what they are doing. Gondzar said some people say \"you're playing God,\" others say \"you are stealing moisture from the storm,\" making other areas drier than they normally would be, kind of like robbing Peter to pay Paul. There are also environmental factors to consider, as well as the cost-effectiveness versus the reward, which in the West these days water is liquid gold. \"Think about it like water storage, but in the winter on mountaintops,\" is how Gondzar described what cloud seeding is trying to achieve in her state, \"in a nutshell.\" Wyoming started cloud seeding in 2003 . Then eight seasons ago, they started doing it in an official capacity after their 10-year study proved it works. This season, they have gone on 28 flight missions for cloud seeding in Wyoming. She pointed out there are four weeks left in the season, so she is hoping for more opportunities before it winds down. When you compare Wyoming to other states such as Utah and North Dakota, who have been cloud seeding since the '70s and '80s, the state is fairly new to the game. Cloud seeding uses an already existing cloud, and injects silver iodide into the cloud, which adds tiny particles called ice nuclei (which water needs to freeze). Clouds, in basic terms, are a collection of water droplets and/or ice crystals floating in the sky. The nuclei help the cloud produce precipitation, and artificial ice nuclei help create more precipitation than the cloud would produce otherwise. It's done in two ways: One way is from the ground and the other is from the air, using silver iodide as the seeding agent. \"The ground-based generators kind of look like small weather stations, are like 20 feet tall, and they aerosolize into the atmosphere,\" Gondzar explained. \"But you have to wait for the right atmospheric conditions so that the plume goes over the mountain range.\" It makes seeding a little more tricky, because if the wind is blowing in the wrong direction, you'll completely miss your target. The most popular way is by plane, using flares. \"There are flares on the wing of the planes with silver iodide inside of cardboard casings and there are flares on the belly of the plane,\" Gondzar pointed out. Once the pilot flies into the storm, they ignite the cardboard casings full of silver iodide and \"seed\" the clouds. The result is more moisture in the cloud, resulting in more precipitation. The silver iodide \"is a natural salt compound,\" Gondzar emphasized. \"The reason it's used is because the geometric shape down to a molecular level is very similar to that of an ice crystal. And if you don't have that, you're not going to create additional ice crystals, which will then accumulate into snowflakes.\" But if you think you can bust the drought by using planes to modify the weather, Gondzar said think again. \"Cloud seeding does not fix the drought,\" Gondzar said. \"You can't break a drought with cloud seeding. It's a tool in the toolbox.\" Gondzar admitted while they know the method makes more snow than they would otherwise receive, it's difficult to know exactly how much more they are getting. \"There's evidence of it in radar and all kinds of papers written,\" Gondzar noted. \"The question that they're trying to answer now is how well does it work? And that's a difficult question to answer. Because there's an abstract piece of this. There's really no way to know how much snow a particular system would have produced.\" She knows cloud seeding doesn't generate a lot of additional snowfall, but every little bit helps these days. According to , some areas in the state are only at 60% of average for snowpack this season, and the window for additional snow is slowly closing as the season winds down. Since most of the West gets the majority of its water from snowmelt, she hopes what they are doing helps a tiny bit in the long term. \"It's a small incremental change over a long period of time. That's why consistency is important,\" Gondzar urged. She added at $28-$34 per acre foot, cloud seeding is relatively cheap. \"Those numbers tell us that this is an inexpensive way to help add water to the system. Essentially, we are creating a little bit of additional snowpack, that becomes additional streamflow in the spring and summer.\" But you need a cloud, to cloud seed. You can't just go out to the Mojave Desert and make it rain. \"This is not something that we can do out of thin air,\" Gondzar cautioned. \"The criteria is very specific for this to actually work.\" It can only be done within already existing clouds that were going to produce snow anyway and there has to be a certain temperature range. \"The silver iodide in the cloud is initiating that snow,\" Gondzar said. \"But you can't just make snow out of nothing. You have to have the supercooled liquid water in the cloud.\" She explained part of what made this year difficult was the much drier weather during the last month. There were fewer opportunities to cloud seed. \"A lot of people think it's manipulating the weather pattern,\" Gondzar remarked. \"We are essentially just playing with cloud dynamics and cloud physics, on a super, super-small scale.\" She is a meteorologist as well and points out the moisture from the weather systems come from much bigger areas like the Gulf of Mexico or the Pacific. \"There's always a huge stream of moisture that our systems are tapping into, and cloud seeding probably brings an additional one to 2% down to the surface.\" While Gondzar is confident cloud seeding doesn't steal snow from another area, some scientists disagree. Daniel Swain is a climate scientist at UCLA and spoke with my colleague and climate writer . He told her \"It is possible that you're actually stealing water from someone else when you do this, because it may be, at least on a regional basis, a zero-sum game where if water falls out of the cloud in one spot, it's even drier by the time it makes it downwind to the next watershed.\" He went on to ask, \"To what extent are you just shifting around the spatial distribution of precipitation during a scarcity period rather than actually causing it to rain or snow more overall?\" He believes water equity issues need to be researched more. Another note of controversy has been the safety of the chemicals used in cloud seeding. Gondzar stressed it is not made of harmful chemicals like some people claim. She pointed out they did lots of testing for before they started officially cloud seeding and could not find any traces of harmful amounts of silver. \"There's silver in natural background levels in the water in the soil everywhere, on the surface of the earth,\" Gondzar noted. \"So you already have a natural background level of silver, it's been really difficult to find anything beyond background levels.\" She said the amount of silver iodide used is only a few grams at a time. What she's hoping is a small price to pay for bigger rewards down the road. There have been climate concerns surrounding cloud seeding. Here's more from Ramirez, who reached out to a few scientists, to get their take on cloud seeding's climate angle. Although cloud seeding has been around for decades and is currently being operated in roughly 50 countries, many climate scientists remain skeptical of the technology's efficacy as well as the time and effort put into trying to manipulate weather. Swain pointed out it has been historically difficult to design scientific experiments to test the effectiveness of cloud seeding, leaving behind a trail of unclear, intangible evidence on what the benefits are. \"How do you know how much precipitation that might actually end up falling from that cloud occurred due to the seeding? Or how much would have fallen without the seeding?\" Swain told CNN. \"This isn't a setting where you can do a truly controlled experiment.\" Cloud seeding experiments typically deal with a narrow set of parameters, according to Swain, taking into account weather conditions including cloud cover, time of the day, and location. Additionally, the rapidly changing climate adds another layer to the list of variables. As the planet warms, weather patterns and clouds will constantly evolve, often in unexpected ways. That's what Sarah Tessendorf, a scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, and other researchers from universities and an Idaho power company, set out to examine in 2017. , published in 2020 in the Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences, managed to quantify how effective cloud seeding is. Yet uncertainties still linger. During the cold winter months in 2017, the researchers flew aircraft to inject silver iodine, the seeding chemical used, into clouds over the Payette Basin in Idaho, while simultaneously using radars and models to measure its impact on snowfall. In three cloud-seeding events, the scientists identified \"unambiguous seeding patterns,\" in cold cloud decks not producing ice at all; but once seeded, ice crystals formed inside mirroring the same pattern the aircraft had flown. They were then able to track the formed ice and snow to the ground and measure how much additional snow fell from the seeded clouds. Despite the results, Tessendorf said more experiments need to be done to improve the technology for it to become a sweeping solution to the climate crisis. The amount of precipitation produced by cloud seeding \u2014 up to 10% \u2014 isn't enough at all to quench the drought-stricken West. \"It could help over the years augment the storage levels in reservoirs, so that when you get into that extract, you might just go into that drought with a little bit more than you would have otherwise,\" she said. \"That to me is the way that cloud seeding should be viewed. It's not going to be the silver bullet, but it could be a helpful tool in a water manager's toolbox.\" When it comes to tackling climate change as a whole, many also question the methods such as the deployment of fossil fuel-powered aircraft to inject silver iodide into clouds, arguing it is counterintuitive to the overall climate goals of slashing fossil fuel emissions. But Tessendorf argued it is a small price to pay in order to improve the technology. \"I will say that the number of aircraft and the duration of these flights to do cloud seeding and the programs that are currently having it done pales in comparison to the number of commercial flights and aircraft we have in the skies all over the world right now,\" she contended. \"So it's to me a drop in the bucket of extra fossil fuels being burned.\" \"But that does not mean that there isn't room for improvement there in order to have more of a clean process,\" Tessendorf added. With the climate crisis accelerating, climate scientists like Swain say resources are much better invested in climate solutions already guaranteed to make significant and equitable impacts. \"There needs to be controlled studies that actually shows it was the seeding that increased the precipitation in a meaningful way,\" Swain asserted. \"The best case scenario is it's a small incremental adjunct to other water-saving or conservation measures during scarce periods, but even that's not clear if it would really work in that capacity in any systematic way.\" CNN meteorologist Judson Jones contributed to this article"},

All the homes are just destroyed,\" Tezeno recounted. She took a long pause; the wound was as fresh as it was that August day in 2020. Tezeno arrived at her Cameron Parish neighborhood fearing the worst, and amid the rubble, there stood her home. It looked unscathed. But Tezeno's feelings of hope were quickly dashed when she opened the door. Inside, it was a very different story. \"The back was all blown out. The AC unit flew off the back of our house. All the siding came off the house, my back porch on my house with two bedrooms and the bathrooms were all caved in,\" Tezeno told CNN. For two years, Tezeno -- a single mother -- and her four children have not been able to move back in as the home gets repaired. She's been living with relatives as she balances what seems like three full-time jobs: her actual full-time job, raising her family, and endlessly dealing with insurance companies. \"This whole thing has taken an emotional toll on me,\" she admitted. Tezeno and her family are preparing to move back in a matter of weeks, which also happens to be right in time for the start of the hurricane season. NOAA is predicting , with 6-10 hurricanes and 3-6 major storms (Category 3 or higher). According to Colorado State University, the chances of Louisiana getting hit with a named storm within 50 miles this season are 84%. \"Oh Jesus, keep us spared,\" Tezeno sighed. As Tezeno and her fellow Louisianans try to mentally prepare for hurricanes yet to come, two years after Laura, Lake Charles -- 45 miles north of Cameron Parish -- still looks like a blue patchwork quilt. \"I still see blue tarps out there, there are plenty of homes and businesses that are still not completely put back together,\" Lake Charles National Weather Service meteorologist Stephen Corbani observed. \"There is a literal PTSD out there in the community,\" explained Lake Charles Mayor Nic Hunter. \"It's a visceral thing.\" The storm cost more than a billion dollars in the state of Louisiana alone, with more than 44,000 households approved by to receive housing assistance. According to , there are still more than 2,000 cases still open in the Lake Charles area -- that's 2,000 families still working to rebuild. \"We have some homes that literally have not been touched since Hurricane Laura,\" Hunter noted. But he told CNN they just got word . \"Though it has taken far too long, there is over a billion dollars in federal aid that has been allocated for hurricanes Laura and Delta. We are immensely thankful for that,\" he added. The previous two hurricane seasons have been particularly cruel for Louisiana. In 2020, , and in 2021, , a Category 4 behemoth, battered the southeastern part of the state on the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. The poundings have left residents wary of what lies ahead. \"Certainly, as we approach hurricane season, locals are just a bit more on edge than they were prior to 2020,\" Hunter acknowledged. While it is impossible to know exactly where these storms will make landfall, the forecasts are grim. \"Looking at some of the climate signals that are out there, like , it seems like we're in store for another above normal season, just in terms of numbers and activity across the Atlantic basin,\" Carboni projected. Lake Charles is home for Carboni too, and like Tezeno, he hopes this year's busy season doesn't end up affecting his area, still so vulnerable from two seasons ago. \"The last thing we need would be for another hurricane to affect this area,\" Carboni remarked. If you are in a hurricane zone and are preparing for the upcoming season, hopefully you have a plan for you and your family, as well as a . After talking to Tezeno, though, she expressed some advice I think many times gets overlooked. \"Write down everything that you have. I don't care if it's minor and take pictures of everything that you can and check your policy,\" she urged. She also recommended securing your home if you evacuate. She recalled many of her neighbors fled their homes, only to come back and find it structurally damaged AND everything inside looted. Lastly, she advised having some sort of hurricane savings account. \"Have as much as you can to take care of yourself without relying on insurance, because sometimes they are not as quick to come to your aid as you think.\""},

Customers around the world are feeling the pain of higher prices. In the United States, the has risen at some of the fastest rates seen since the 1980s. Historically, when such high bouts of inflation have occurred, recessions and widespread job losses have quickly followed. And, in the past, that has led to \"stagflation\" \u2014 an unpleasant mix of double-digit inflation, declining economic activity and high unemployment. As the odds of a recession in the US grow, what are the risks that history repeats? Our baseline expectation is for the US to enter a recession in 2023. But we don't expect to see the stagflation that we saw in the 1970s and early 1980s. Here's why: We now have two of the three ingredients for stagflation \u2014 high inflation and low or no economic growth \u2014 but we are missing the third: high unemployment. The US labor market is on a tear and shows little sign of contracting, which makes a 1970s-style stagflation scenario far less probable. Consider the following: Much of the labor demand reflects a deep need for certain skills across a range of industries, and the labor supply remains insufficient for the jobs at hand, even with lower growth. Even if firms cut their job openings by 20% and increase layoffs by 20%, the US labor market will still be relatively tight, according to our own analysis. And some firms may be reluctant to let go of workers in this coming recession, fearful that they may not be able to hire them back. A danger of high inflation is that it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, making inflation stubbornly \"sticky.\" When people expect prices to rise even further, they will understandably ask for higher pay. (And during labor shortages, they often get it.) To make up the difference in their profit margins, employers in turn charge higher prices for the goods and services they provide, which in turn leads to demand for higher pay, feeding the wage-price spiral. This is what we saw back in the '70s, with anecdotes of employees negotiating double-digit annual wage increases over three years in anticipation of persistent inflation. That said, although measures of for the next 12 months have risen, most consumers, business leaders and the financial markets don't expect such inflation rates to persist much longer after that, according to and of inflation expectations, which have been steadily falling over the past five months after rising the previous two years. We're in a vastly different world today compared to the '70s. Supply-side issues are improving, inflation seems to already be contracting, and jobs are plentiful. Most important, the Fed has more credibility as an inflation fighter than it did in the '70s. The is aware that its recent aggressive rate hikes are still not restrictive enough when it comes to taming inflation. A lot of energy is spent analyzing the Fed and forecasting its next moves. At , we're no exception. We believe that, although the Fed was late in raising rates last year, it is now intent on bringing down inflation to its 2% target, even if a recession occurs. That likely means raising short-term rates to at least 4% so long as inflation remains well above 2%. No soft landing, but no stagflation either. In 2023, we will likely see lower inflation and declining real gross domestic product for a time. More layoffs will likely occur, and the unemployment rate will rise from its very low 3.7% rate, but perhaps not by that much. My base case has it remaining well below 5%, a \"job-full\" recession compared to the recessions of the past. This certainly does not look like the stagflation of the 1970s. It's clear that the labor market will likely stay strong, even if we end up in a recession."},

We had several this year that brought , staggering to the mountains in the west, and even . An atmospheric river is a long, narrow region in the atmosphere that can transport moisture thousands of miles, like a fire hose in the sky. We talk a lot about them in the West because large-scale storm systems bring the region up to 40% of their yearly rainfall. But we started wondering: Is there anywhere else where these happen? Apparently, atmospheric rivers also occur in the eastern US, unleashing a river of moisture like what we will see this week. The reason East Coast atmospheric rivers aren't talked about much isn't because they are rare. In fact, they are quite common. \"Atmospheric rivers are more frequent on the East Coast than they are on the West Coast,\" said Jason Cordeira, Associate Professor of Meteorology at Plymouth State University. \"They're just not as impactful and don't usually produce as much rainfall.\" While Cordeira noted it is tough to give an exact number of how many atmospheric rivers impact the East every year, he says a rough estimate would be anywhere from 80-100 per year! WOW. The West gets about half that number of atmospheric rivers each year, yet they account for double the annual rainfall percentage. \"The West Coast is a much more arid climate. And they usually get precipitation during just half of the year,\" Cordeira pointed out. The East Coast accumulates its annual rainfall from several sources: afternoon storms, cold fronts and hurricanes, which can bring MUCH higher rain amounts than an atmospheric river. \"Some of the strongest atmospheric river events that are perfectly oriented, can produce 6-8 inches of rain,\" Cordeira reported. \"Those totals are dwarfed by the amount of rainfall that we can get from a hurricane.\" Some recent hurricanes such as , have resulted in rainfall totals measured in FEET, not inches. This week's atmospheric river won't leave the footprint Harvey did by any stretch, but it could affect the same areas as Harvey. The Deep South will once again be hit by a series of storms this week, along with the Plains, the Rockies and the Pacific Northwest. So, needless to say, this week's weather will be much more far-reaching. It has no doubt been a super active stretch of severe weather in the South and Southeast, as this is the fourth week in a row where active weather is affecting the same areas. However, as we get deeper into April and May, we should start to see the storm tracks shift a little farther north into what is traditionally, \"Tornado Alley,\" which is what we will begin to see this week. A series of storm systems will impact the US this week from coast to coast. It will bring everything from blizzard conditions to tornadoes to flash flooding, an exhausting week to say the least. The Storm Prediction Center (SPC) has placed a Level 3 out of 5 \"enhanced risk\" of severe weather today for central Arkansas, however, anywhere from San Antonio to the Ohio Valley could see storms today. The extreme northeast of Texas, southeast Oklahoma and western and central Arkansas, including Little Rock, are under a tornado watch until 11 p.m. CT Monday. Large hail -- possibly greater than baseball size -- and wind gusts to 70 mph are also a concern for the area. While this is happening in the central part of the country, a robust system will be entering the Pacific Northwest, and will crisscross the country in dramatic fashion today, bringing heavy rain to the coastal areas of Washington, Oregon and California, and several feet of snow for the Cascades. \"This system will deepen as it moves farther inland, setting the stage for an intense late season winter storm to impact the Rockies and Northern Plains,\" noted the Weather Prediction Center (WPC). \"Over a foot of snow is likely to accumulate between eastern Montana and central North Dakota on Tuesday.\" Blizzard warnings are in effect for portions of the Dakotas and Montana from Tuesday through Thursday. \"Total snow accumulations between 12 and 24 inches [are forecast],\" said the National Weather Service (NWS) office in Bismarck. \"Winds gusting as high as 50 mph [are also possible].\" The heavy snow and high winds will make travel nearly impossible for those areas due to whiteout conditions and will also create avalanche dangers. Many of the western mountain ranges have some sort of avalanche danger today, so be sure to check before heading out, especially in the backcountry. We wrote a story earlier in the season about what causes extreme avalanche dangers and why you only have about 15-30 minutes to be found alive after burial. Click to read more. After the system blankets the West with its late-season dump of snow, the storm will amplify as it heads east. It will combine with the available moisture provided by the atmospheric river we talked about and will result in the perfect setup for severe weather. The tornado threat will be even stronger for Tuesday and Wednesday in the midsection of the country. But the storms will be impacting areas much farther north than the previous rounds of severe weather we have seen during the last three weeks. Tuesday there is again a Level 3 out of 5 \"enhanced\" risk of severe storms from Dallas to Omaha, which includes more than 16 million people. While it is the area with the highest likelihood of storms, nearly 40 million people will have some possibility of seeing storms. \"Any thunderstorms that can develop in this very favorable thermodynamic environment will likely become severe quickly,\" the SPC advised. They mentioned any (strong thunderstorm) will be capable of producing tornadoes, saying \"some of the tornadoes could be strong.\" By Wednesday, we enter Day Three of this multiday severe event. The main threat area will shift east with the third day of a Level 3 out of 5 \"enhanced risk\" of severe weather. The bullseye will be from northern Louisiana to the south side of Chicago and include places like Shreveport, Little Rock, Memphis, St. Louis, and Indianapolis. \"Large to very large hail, damaging winds and tornadoes will all be possible,\" said the SPC. \"Strong tornadoes may occur.\" Dallas, Houston, New Orleans, and Chicago could all see storms as well. The good news is the severe threat will be over in time for Easter weekend. We could still see some lingering showers in the eastern half of the country, and some mountain snow in the Rockies, which could affect egg hunts and sunrise services. While things could change between now and then, right now the SPC doesn't have any areas highlighted for severe weather during Easter weekend as of now. As if severe storms and blizzard conditions weren't enough of a headline this week, extremely cold air will follow the front, plunging overnight temperatures into the single digits is forecast for portions of the northern Plains. \"Low temperatures in the single digits are possible and this could cause issues,\" said the NWS office in Billings. \"Do not be deceived by the sun, it is going to be fighting a very cold airmass.\" And as the climate crisis continues to change the dynamics of our weather, expect atmospheric rivers to become more intense as well. \"It's expected that as the air temperatures increase, the air can hold more water vapor and therefore any storms that are comprised of water vapor will have more of it,\" Cordeira explained. \"So, an atmospheric river, which is defined as a region of water vapor, will likely become more intense. Their frequency may not be more common, but their intensity could become larger.\" The drought-stricken West is getting even drier, according to the latest . \"Central Washington, Idaho, and northwest Montana also saw increases in drought extent or severity as short-term dryness continues to build upon long-term moisture deficits extending back to last year,\" according to the drought monitor. \"Many parts of southern Idaho, and the rest of the West, have set records for the driest three-month period (January to March) going back 100 years or more.\" Texas is also facing extreme drought with 95% of the state in some level of drought. At 26,000 square miles, Texas has more \"exceptional drought\" area than any other state, per the latest US Drought Monitor. The 26,000 square miles of exceptional drought is larger than the state of West Virginia (or more than three times the size of Massachusetts). The drought is only making fire conditions worse. From Texas to Kansas, there will be an extreme fire danger especially on Tuesday, as dry conditions and winds topping 50 mph will cover the area.

The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted 13 to 1 earlier in the day to recommend updated mRNA boosters for Americans this fall. Walensky's decision means the shots could be available by Friday, according to pharmaceutical manufacturers, which began shipping the new doses after the US Food and Drug Administration authorized them Wednesday. \"The updated COVID-19 boosters are formulated to better protect against the most recently circulating COVID-19 variant,\" Walensky said in a statement. \"They can help restore protection that has waned since previous vaccination and were designed to provide broader protection against newer variants. This recommendation followed a comprehensive scientific evaluation and robust scientific discussion. If you are eligible, there is no bad time to get your COVID-19 booster and I strongly encourage you to receive it.\" The updated boosters have instructions that tell our cells to make antibodies against two strains of the virus that causes Covid-19: the original strain and the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron subvariants, which share the same spike. Pfizer/BioNTech's updated vaccine is a 30-microgram dose authorized for people 12 and older. Moderna's updated vaccine is a 50-microgram dose authorized for people 18 and older. The CDC said in the statement that it \"also expects to recommend updated COVID-19 boosters for other pediatric groups\" in the coming weeks. People are eligible for the updated boosters as long as they have completed all primary doses in their vaccine series. The committee recommended that the new boosters be given at least two months after the last dose of any Covid-19 vaccine and up to three months after an infection. The new formulations do not replace shots for the primary series. The boosters were approved based on studies in mice bred to have human ACE-2 receptors -- the doors the coronavirus uses to get into our cells -- but clinical trial data showing how well they may work in humans won't be available for another month or two. This is similar to the way annual flu shots are studied and approved, but it's the first time for Covid-19 vaccines. In approving the vaccines, regulators also reviewed data behind different two-strain boosters. Those carry instructions to fight the original strain of the Omicron variant, BA.1, along with the original virus. Those boosters have been studied in about 1,400 people. They have been authorized for use in the UK and Canada but will not be available in the US. Several of the committee members said Thursday that they were uncomfortable recommending a vaccine with no human data to back it. \"We're been extrapolating the data that has been seen with the bivalent BA.1, and hopefully, we'll have similar data for BA.4 and BA.5,\" said Dr. Pablo Sanchez, a pediatrician at Ohio State University and a member of the committee. \"So I'm just concerned about that extrapolation. And because and ultimately, I really don't want to establish a precedent of recommending a vaccine that we don't have clinical data,\" said Sanchez, who voted against the recommendation. That prompted a quick rebuttal from government experts who work with the committee. \"I just would like to remind the committee that every year, we use influenza vaccines that are based on new strains without clinical studies being done,\" said Dr. Melinda Wharton, associate director for vaccine policy at the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. Dr. Doran Fink, deputy director of the FDA's Division of Vaccines and Related Products Applications, said, \"I do appreciate the amount of discomfort that I'm hearing from committee members who are being asked to take this leap with the Covid vaccines that they haven't been asked to make previously with the Covid vaccines. \"FDA felt very comfortable with the approach of extrapolating the safety and effectiveness or rather the known and potential benefits,\" Fink said. \"We recognize that we've taken a different path than the regulatory authorities have in Europe and Canada.\" Fink said the US chose to go this route based on feedback from its independent advisory group and projections for the viruses that may be circulating in this country over the fall and winter. On Thursday, the committee saw new modeling data that suggested there were substantial risks to waiting to roll out new boosters. According to the CDC's forecasts, boosters given to US adults in September could prevent 137,000 more hospitalizations and 9,700 deaths than if the boosters were held until November. New analyses on the cost-effectiveness of the boosters suggest that the US could save at least $63 billion in medical costs between August and March 31 if as many people get these boosters as got flu shots during the 2021-22 season. In the studies that looked at the shot targeting BA.1 along with the original, the boosters broadened immunity against many variants, and they were proven to be better than the older single-strain boosters because they made higher levels of antibodies. Moderna presented tantalizing data suggesting that the two-strain shots it developed against the Beta variant might extend the length of protection people get from their vaccines, which currently drops off significantly after about four months. It said a study on these results was being prepared for publication In mice bred to have human ACE-2 receptors, the two-strain vaccines against BA.4 and BA.5 protected better against infections in their lungs, compared with the original vaccine. About two-thirds of the total US population is vaccinated against Covid-19 with an initial series, according to data from the CDC. But less than half of those with their initial series -- and less than a third of the total population -- has also gotten a booster.

Now, a battery-powered glove could help workers by taking some of the strain. The \"Ironhand\" glove strengthens the wearer's grip, meaning they don't have to use as much force to perform repetitive manual tasks. Its developer, Bioservo, says it can increase the wearer's hand strength by 20%. The Swedish company describes the system as a \"soft exoskeleton.\" Exoskeletons are an external device that supports and protects the body, typically increasing strength and endurance. Most have a rigid structure, but the Ironhand is soft, like a regular glove. \"When you have the glove on, it provides strength and reduces the effort needed when lifting objects,\" says Mikael Wester, Bioservo's marketing director. \"It's all in order to reduce fatigue and prevent strain injuries in the long run.\" The system consists of a backpack, which houses the power pack, and artificial tendons that connect to the glove. There are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object. A remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip. Wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry, using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses. Each Ironhand system costs around \u20ac6,000 ($7,275). The device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer's risk of developing strain injuries. According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, work-related neck and upper limb disorders are the , costing national economies up to 2% of their gross national product. The glove was originally intended for workers in a very different setting to the factory floor. NASA developed an early version of the technology, called \"Robo-Glove,\" to help astronauts grasp objects and carry out work in space. Bioservo licensed the design in 2016 and then partnered with auto manufacturer General Motors (GM) to develop the glove for its workers. \"Ergonomics is really the field of trying to fit the jobs to the workers, instead of the workers having to conform and adapt to the job,\" says Stephen Krajcarski, a senior manager with GM's ergonomics team. \"By using tools such as the Ironhand we are really trying to mitigate any potential concerns or physical demands that may eventually cause a medical concern for that individual operator.\" Krajcarski says GM has helped Bioservo to test and improve the Ironhand by piloting it in a variety of jobs at its manufacturing plants. He says some workers have found it easy to use but adds that it's not suitable for all situations. The Ironhand is just one of the exoskeletons GM is looking into. According to market research firm ABI Research, the exoskeleton market will grow from . \"If you look at exoskeletons, this is just one of the tools that are out there,\" says Krajcarski. \"But this is an exciting technology.\" This story has been updated to correct the cost of the Ironhand system."},

One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks, and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one. Among them is San Diego-based TuSimple. Founded in 2015, TuSimple has completed about 2 million miles of road tests with its 70 prototype trucks across the US, China and Europe. Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology, TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world's largest truck manufacturers -- Navistar in the US and Traton, Volkswagen's trucking business, in Europe -- to design and build fully autonomous models, which it hopes to launch by 2024. TuSimple's latest road test involved hauling fresh produce 951 miles, from Nogales, Arizona to Oklahoma City. The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver, but for the bulk of the route -- from Tucson to Dallas -- the truck drove itself. \"Today, because the system is not fully ready, we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we're testing, but we drove in full autonomy: the driver wasn't touching the wheel,\" said Cheng Lu, TuSimple's president and CEO. The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver, mostly because a truck doesn't need to sleep. \"In the US, a driver can only work 11 hours a day. We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation,\" said Lu. That, of course, negates the advantage of an autonomous system, so the idea is that once TuSimple's trucks hit the market, there will be no need to have anyone onboard. Unlike self-driving cars, which are a still , TuSimple trucks won't be required to operate in bustling city traffic, but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company's own software.  \"We collect data from the roads, and we create this very detailed, high definition map of each route. That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles,\" said Lu. As a result, TuSimple's trucks will only be able to self-drive along these pre-mapped trade corridors, which Lu calls \"virtual railroads,\" and nowhere else. According to the company, in the US 80% of goods travel through just 10% of the nation's trade corridors, so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business. TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas, and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024. Its plans are dependent on state legislation, however, because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads.  The technology will add about $50,000 to the cost of a truck, making the final price roughly $200,000. According to Lu, that's still cheaper than paying for a human driver. \"If you take $50,000 and divide it by 1 million miles, the average lifespan of a truck, that means you're adding five cents per mile. But you're saving the cost of a human driver, which based on average US wages is about $80,000 to $120,000 per year -- or 80 cents to $1.20 per mile. Today, the direct labor cost is about 50% of the cost of operating a truck,\" he said. That doesn't mean driverless trucks will take away jobs, according to Lu. By focusing on the \"middle mile,\" rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods, TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers, while at the same time protecting existing jobs. \"A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day -- that's not what autonomy is meant for. We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver, even if they enter the workforce today,\" said Lu. Instead, TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers, which involve long stretches of monotonous driving. \"Take Phoenix to El Paso: that's a six-hour drive. A person cannot make the round trip, because it's more than 11 hours. But the truck can go back and forth all day, the most mundane job that drivers don't want to do. That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile (pickup and delivery).They get to work a full day, which is a more efficient use of their time, and they get to go home at night to their family,\" said Lu. Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased, TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests, without a human safety driver in the cabin at all, before the end of the year. The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024. Lu says that 7,000 have been reserved in the US alone.  TuSimple has prominent competitors, such as Google spinoff Waymo and Uber-backed Aurora, but those are working on a wider range of self-driving vehicles, including passenger cars. TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks, like US companies Plus and Embark.  Grayson Brulte, an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte & Co., believes TuSimple is on the right track. \"The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose-built for trucking. They're not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class-8 trucks. These are different skills and different systems altogether,\" he said.  Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits.

Explaining its decision, the company \u2014 one of several in England and Wales to have announced water usage limits in recent weeks \u2014 said extreme temperatures and this summer's heatwave had resulted in the highest demand for water in more than 25 years. \"The driest July since 1885, the hottest temperatures on record, and the River Thames reaching its lowest level since 2005 have led to a drop in reservoir levels in the Thames Valley and London,\" it said. The TUB does not apply to businesses, although Thames Water said it was asking those within its area \"to be mindful of the drought and to use water wisely.\" This could involve companies switching off water features on their premises and not washing their vehicles, it suggested. \"Implementing a Temporary Use Ban for our customers has been a very difficult decision to make and one which we have not taken lightly,\" Sarah Bentley, the Thames Water CEO, said. \"After months of below average rainfall and the recent extreme temperatures in July and August, water resources in our region are depleted,\" Bentley added. The announcement of the ban comes at a time when many water companies are facing criticism related to leaks from their pipes. For its part, Thames Water said it had teams focused on locating and fixing more than 1,100 leaks per week. When it comes to enforcement of the ban, the firm said it hoped and expected customers to continue using water wisely. \"If we become aware of customers ignoring the restrictions, we'll contact them to make sure they're aware of the rules and how to use water responsibly and wisely,\" it added. \"There are criminal offences for those that repeatedly ignore requests to comply with the ban.\" Last month saw temperatures in the U.K. surge, with highs of over 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) recorded for the first time ever. On Aug. 12, the U.K.'s Environment Agency announced that parts of England had moved into drought status. \"In drought affected areas the public and businesses should be very mindful of the pressures on water resources and should use water wisely,\" authorities said. They added that government expected water firms \"to act to reduce leakage and fix leaking pipes as quickly as possible and take wider action alongside government policy.\" The U.K. is not alone when it comes to drought-related issues. On July 18, the European Commission's Joint Research Centre published a report looking at drought in Europe. \"The severe drought affecting several regions of Europe since the beginning of the year continues expanding and worsening,\" it said. \"Dry conditions are related to a wide and persistent lack of precipitation combined with early heatwaves in May and June.\" In an interview with CNBC earlier this week, Bill Hare, CEO and senior scientist at research non-profit Climate Analytics, explained how the current conditions were having wide-ranging effects. \"On the water supply, it's clear that in the U.K. and other parts of Europe, we're seeing already very significant water stress that's beginning to affect \u2026 ordinary urban residents, not just farmers,\" he said. \"We're seeing the lack of availability for cooling water for thermal, nuclear or coal power stations, which is causing curtailment of power,\" Hare, who was speaking to CNBC's Joumanna Bercetche, said. \"This is a problem we're seeing all over the world,\" he added. \"We're seeing, also, issues for example in Germany, now in the Danube region, with low water flow, meaning you can't carry cargo anymore.\" This was in turn, \"having big implications not just for the transport of energy, but for agriculture, all manner of industrial commodities and so on.\""},

Toyota Battery Manufacturing North Carolina is set to start operations in 2025, with the firm stating that total investment in the plant will now amount to $3.8 billion. Norm Bafunno, who is senior vice president, unit manufacturing and engineering at Toyota Motor North America, said the announcement marked \"another significant milestone\" for the business. The additional investment in the U.S. is part of a wider investment of up to $5.6 billion in battery production, with Toyota noting that demand for battery electric vehicles was growing. To this end, the business said it would aim to ramp up \"combined battery production capacity\" in the U.S. and Japan by as much as 40 gigawatt hours. As well as diesel and gasoline vehicles, Toyota is known for its hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell offerings. It is also attempting to make headway in the increasingly competitive battery-electric market, where firms like Tesla and Volkswagen are jostling for position. This has not been without its challenges. In June 2022, Toyota issued a safety recall for more than 2,000 of its all-electric SUV, the bZ4X. Toyota may be looking to invest billions in EV battery production, but on Wednesday the business stressed it would also \"continue to make every effort to flexibly meet the needs\" of customers \"in all countries and regions by offering multiple powertrains and providing as many options as possible.\" Indeed, the website of Toyota Europe states that the \"internal combustion engine continues to be the most popular means of powering vehicles and it will continue to play a role for the next 20 to 30 years.\" All the above comes at a time when major economies are laying out plans to reduce the environmental footprint of road-based transportation. Just this month, the California Air Resources Board approved a rule that will require all new car sales in the state to be zero emission by the year 2035. Elsewhere, the U.K. wants to stop the sale of new diesel and gasoline cars and vans by 2030. It will require, from 2035, all new cars and vans to have zero-tailpipe emissions. The European Union \u2014 which the U.K. left on Jan. 31, 2020 \u2014 is pursuing similar targets. According to the International Energy Agency, electric vehicle sales hit 6.6 million in 2021. In the first quarter of 2022, EV sales came to 2 million, a 75% increase compared to the first three months of 2021."},

Situated roughly 89 kilometers (approximately 55 miles) off the coast of Yorkshire, England, the scale of Hornsea 2 is considerable. According to Orsted, it has a capacity of more than 1.3 gigawatts and stretches across an area of 462 square kilometers \u2014 more than half the size of New York City. Hornsea 2, it added, uses Siemens Gamesa turbines with blades measuring 81 meters, or more than 265 feet. \"One revolution of the wind turbine blades can power an average UK home for 24 hours,\" the company says. It is the latest step forward for the Hornsea 2 project, which generated its first power in Dec. 2021. The development comes as European countries attempt to wean themselves off Russian fossil fuels, including gas, following the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine in February. \"Current global events highlight more than ever the importance of landmark renewable energy projects like Hornsea 2, helping the UK increase the security and resilience of its energy supply and drive down costs for consumers by reducing dependence on expensive fossil fuels,\" said Duncan Clark, head of the U.K. region at Orsted. The U.K. is home to a mature offshore wind sector that looks set to expand in the coming years, with authorities aiming for up to 50 GW of capacity by 2030. The European Union, which the U.K. left in January 2020, has previously laid out a 300 GW target for offshore wind by the middle of this century. Across the Atlantic, the U.S. has a long way to go to catch up with Europe. America's first offshore wind facility, the 30 megawatt Block Island Wind Farm, only started commercial operations in late 2016.

Over the past two years, fall and winter have brought devastating Covid surges that took hundreds of thousands of lives and pushed hospitals to the breaking point. But U.S. health officials say the nation is in a much different place today due to the arsenal of tools doctors now have to fight the virus. \"We are in a much, much better place. We are in a better place because people have gotten vaccinated and boosted. We've got treatments that are widely available,\" Dr. Ashish Jha, White House Covid response coordinator, said in an August interview with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in a report published in early August, said high levels of immunity in the U.S. population from vaccination and infection have substantially reduced the threat of hospitalization and death from Covid. The CDC ended its quarantine recommendations for people exposed to the virus last month. Public health officials are calling on people to stay up to date on their vaccines, but are largely leaving it up to individuals to decide what other precautions they should take based on their health history, risk tolerance and how much Covid is spreading in their communities. The CDC is taking a more targeted approach that focuses on making sure those at the highest risk of severe illness have access to vaccines, antiviral treatments and other therapeutics to protect their health. Many people haven't had a vaccine dose in months, which means their immune protection against the virus is waning off with some studies showing three shots of the original vaccines were just 19% effective at preventing Covid infection after five months. At the same time, more transmissible omicron subvariants are spreading. It's creating a perfect storm ahead of the cold weather months and holidays that force people indoors in close proximity to each other and a highly contagious airborne pathogen. Even with all the tools the U.S. has available, Covid infections, hospitalizations and deaths have plateaued at stubbornly high levels over the summer. The U.S. is gearing up for a booster campaign after Labor Day with reformulated vaccines that target both the original strain of the virus that emerged in Wuhan, China, in 2019 and omicron BA.5, the dominant variant in circulation. Public health officials believe the reformulated boosters will provide more durable protection against infection and help avert a major surge that taxes hospitals. \"It's going to be really, really important for people to get this updated, new, very specific Covid vaccine because I think it's going to help a lot in preventing infections, and I think it is going to help a lot in keeping people out of the hospital,\" Jha said. The U.S. has so far secured 171 million doses of Pfizer's and Moderna's new boosters shots that target omicron. The reformulated boosters could reduce infections by 2.4 million, hospitalizations by 137,000 and deaths by 9,700 from August through May of 2023 if a new variant doesn't emerge, according to a projection by a team of scientists who forecast the trajectory of the pandemic, called the Covid-19 Scenario Modeling Hub. But the projection is based on optimistic assumptions about booster coverage and efficacy, according to the scientists. The model assumes that the shots will prove 80% effective at preventing illness, the vaccination campaign will ramp up quickly and the public will broadly embrace the new boosters. But many people in the U.S. still haven't gotten their first booster with the old vaccine yet, and it's not clear that these individuals will be more willing to take the new shots. About 76% of people ages 12 and older have received their first two vaccine doses, according to CDC data. Out of those people, about half have gotten their third shot. It's also not clear how effective the new omicron boosters will be in the real world yet. The Food and Drug Administration authorized the shots on Wednesday without results from human trials on the BA.5 shots. But Dr. Peter Marks, head of the FDA office responsible for reviewing vaccines, said the available data suggests the shots will provide substantially better protection. Public health officials are working under the assumption that the U.S. will face some version of omicron in the fall, which is why the new vaccines target BA.5. But there is always the risk that a new variant outside the omicron lineage will emerge that can evade the new shots. If Covid mutates in a way that gives life to a new, dominant variant and boosters are slow to get out to the public, the U.S. could suffer 1.3 million hospitalizations and 181,000 deaths over the next nine months, according to the scientists' most pessimistic scenario. But Michael Osterholm, director of Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said the reality is that nobody really knows what will happen in the fall. \"We don't know,\" he said. Ali Mokdad, an epidemiologist at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, said his group is predicting a rise in Covid cases, deaths and hospitalizations this fall. \"But the rise in mortality and hospitalization will not be similar to what we have seen before, simply because most people have some kind of immunity against illness,\" Mokdad said. About 95% of people ages 16 and older in the U.S., in fact, have Covid antibodies of some sort \u2014 either from vaccination or prior infection, according to a CDC survey of blood donor data. This means more people in the U.S. have at least some protection against severe disease and death from Covid than at any other point in the pandemic. Previous infection, vaccination alone and vaccination plus infection didn't necessarily keep people from getting sick, but they all showed more than 70% effectiveness against developing a really severe case or dying from omicron BA.2 , according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine by Weill Cornell Medicine in Qatar. The study examined the medical records of 100,000 individuals in Qatar from December 2021 through February 2022. But the Qatar study may not translate well to the U.S. population, which has a large elderly population and many people with preexisting medical conditions, like obesity or diabetes. Qatar on the other hand has a very young population \u2014 only 9% of its residents are age 50 or older compared with more than a third of all Americans. Omicron has also continued to evolve into more transmissible and immune-evasive subvariants. The BA.5 subvariant became dominant this summer, pushing out BA.2. Though BA.5 has not been associated with more severe disease, it is more effective at evading immunity and infecting people who are vaccinated or who have recovered from Covid. \"BA.5 is the most contagious, certainly the most immune evasive variant we've seen,\" Jha told NBC News in July. \"That means if you were infected earlier this you're still at very high risk of reinfection. It means if you've not been vaccinated recently you have a very high risk of having a breakthrough.\" While the CDC previously thought that infection provided about 90 days of protection, Jha told reporters in July that breakthrough infections have become more common and are happening earlier with BA.5. He said it's unclear how long immunity lasts after recovering from a BA.5 infection. Osterholm said the pandemic has entered another unprecedented period. Previously, infections have surged to high peaks and then steeply declined before the next wave. But for the past three months, infections, hospitalizations and deaths have plateaued at a high level with no sign of another variant displacing BA.5, he said. \"We're seeing now more and more people are on their second and third episodes of this,\" Osterholm said. \"What is the interaction between increasing vaccination, natural infection and immunity related to infection? We just don't know,\" he said. It's unclear whether the current pattern of transmission will continue or if the U.S. will face another wave, Osterholm said. Right now, the U.S. is averaging more than 88,000 new infections daily, which is likely a vast undercount because people testing positive at home isn't picked up by the official data. More than 32,000 people total are hospitalized across the U.S. with Covid right now, and an average of nearly 400 people are still dying every day from the virus, according to data from the CDC and the Health and Human Services Department. That's a significant improvement from the peak of the outbreak in the winter of 2021 when more than 3,000 people died a day on average. Though milder today than those early days of the pandemic, Covid is still killing at four or five times the fatality rate of the flu, Jha told the Chamber. \"If everybody was up to date on their vaccines and people got treated with Paxlovid as they're supposed to deaths would go to close to zero across America,\" Jha said. Hospitalizations are down 75% and deaths are down 85% from the peak of last winter's omicron surge. But if deaths remain at their current level through next year, more than 140,000 people would succumb to the virus, which would still make Covid one of the 10 leading causes of death in the U.S. \"Will we continue to see this kind of activity maintained for some time? People will say it can't go on endlessly because people will be infected and develop immunity. But what happens with waning immunity?\" Osterholm said. Many elderly people and individuals with weak immune systems remain vulnerable to the virus. The rate of hospitalization and death from Covid has increased among those ages 65 and older since April despite high levels of vaccination in this age group, according to CDC data. Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at the Brown University School of Public Health, said she is worried about the elderly and those with weak immune systems who are not up to date on their vaccines heading into the fall. Nuzzo said the public health response this fall should be laser focused on making sure these people are protected. \"I have some worry that unless we put that at the top of our list, our efforts are just going to be diluted, spread out over a number of different areas,\" Nuzzo said. \"If we fail to make sure the highest-risk people are fully protected, that's when we're going to see the deaths and that's the most important thing we could try to prevent.\" Although 92% of those ages 65 and older received the first two doses of the vaccine, many of them have not stayed up to date with their boosters. About 70% received their third dose and only 40% have gotten their fourth shot since the FDA authorized it in February. People ages 50 and older who received a second booster dose were 14 times less likely to die from Covid than the unvaccinated, and three times less likely to die than people who had one booster dose, according to CDC data. Dr. Paul Offit, an infectious disease expert at Children's Hospital Philadelphia, said people ages 75 and older, people with serious medical conditions and those with compromised immune systems would benefit the most from getting a booster right now. Deaths from Covid have risen in particular among people ages 75 and older, according to the CDC. The CDC has also emphasized the importance of using therapeutics to protect people who simply cannot mount a strong immune response to the virus even with vaccination. Nearly 3% of U.S. adults have compromised immune systems, or about 7 million people ages 18 or older, according a survey published in 2016 in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The CDC has emphasized the importance of administering an investigational antibody therapy called Evusheld for people ages 12 and older with moderate and severely compromised immune systems. Evusheld is administered as two injections, before Covid infection, every six months to prevent severe illness, according to the FDA. But only 450,000 courses of the medicine have been administered so far, according to the Health and Human Services Department. \"The goal moving forward here for this year, next year, five years and 10 years down the road is protecting the vulnerable,\" Offit said."},

The agency's independent committee on vaccines voted 13 to 1 earlier Thursday in favor of the shots after reviewing the available safety and effectiveness data over an almost seven-hour-long meeting. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky signed off on the shots a few hours later, clearing the way for pharmacies to soon start administering the shots. Pfizer 's omicron boosters were OKed for people ages 12 and older, while Moderna 's updated shots were authorized for people ages 18 and older. The eligible age groups can receive the boosters at least two months after completing their primary series or their most recent booster with the old shots. Walensky said her decision followed \"a comprehensive scientific evaluation and robust scientific discussion.\" \"If you are eligible, there is no bad time to get your Covid-19 booster and I strongly encourage you to receive it,\" she said in a statement. Pfizer plans to ask the Food and Drug Administration to also authorize the new boosters for children ages 5 to 11 years old in early October, company executives told the committee Thursday. The original vaccines will no longer be used as a booster in people ages 12 and older now that the reformulated shots are coming online. Public health officials are expecting another wave of Covd infection this fall as immunity from the old vaccines wanes off, more contagious omicron subvariants spread, and people spend more time indoors as the weather turns colder and families gather for the holidays. The CDC and the FDA hope the new boosters will provide more durable protection against infection, mild illness and severe disease. The reformulated shots target omicron BA.5, the dominant variant of Covid as well as the strain that emerged in China more than two years ago. The U.S so far has secured 171 million doses of Pfizer's and Moderna's new boosters. More than 200 million people are eligible for the shots, according to the CDC. Dr. Sara Oliver, a CDC official, told the committee Thursday that there should be enough supply of the vaccine to meet demand this fall. There is no data from human trials on the new BA.5 boosters, so it's unclear how they will perform in the real world. The CDC and FDA used human data from clinical trials for shots targeting the original version of omicron, BA.1, which triggered a stronger immune response than the old vaccines. Pfizer and Moderna were originally developing omicron boosters to target BA.1, but the FDA asked the companies to switch gears in June and develop BA.5 shots instead after the subvariant became dominant. The decision to focus on BA.5 did not leave enough time to wait for data from human trials ahead of a fall vaccine rollout. The lack of human data for the BA.5 shots has caused some controversy, but Dr. Peter Marks, a senior FDA official, said the agency followed the same process used for years with strain changes for flu vaccines. Marks said on Wednesday that flu vaccine strains are also changed without human clinical data. Dr. Pablo Sanchez, the only committee member who voted against the shots, called the recommendation premature and said the U.S. should have waited for human data before proceeding with the boosters. \"There's a lot of vaccine hesitancy already \u2014 we need the human data,\" said Sanchez, a professor of pediatrics at Ohio State University. But Sanchez said he believes the new boosters are safe and he will likely receive one himself. Panel member Dr. Oliver Brooks, chief medical officer at Watts HealthCare Corporation in Los Angeles, questioned why the FDA decided to go with a BA.5 vaccine when clinical data is available for the BA.1 shots that the vaccine makers were originally developing. Brooks ended up voting in favor the shots. But Dr. Sarah Long, also a committee member, said there's no reason to expect the BA.5 boosters will be inferior to the old shots since they also include the original Covid strain, and they have potential to reduce hospitalizations and deaths heading into the fall and winter. Long also voted in favor. Officials at the FDA and CDC have said the omicron BA.1 and omicron BA.5 boosters are similar enough that the immune response data from the BA.1 shot should give a good indication of how the BA.5 shots will perform. Omicron BA.1 and BA.5 are closely related with a four-mutation difference, according to Dr. Jacqueline Miller, who works on vaccine development at Moderna. Moderna completed enrollment in clinical trials on the BA.5 shots last week and should have results by the end of the year, Miller told the CDC committee on Thursday. Pfizer's clinical trial is also ongoing, though company hasn't said when it expects results. The health agencies also reviewed data on the BA.5 shots from mouse studies. Moderna presented data showing that the BA.5 shots increased antibodies in mice more than fourfold compared with the old shots. The mice express the same cell protein as humans that the virus latches onto. Pfizer's BA.5 booster increased antibodies 2.6 fold in mice compared with the original vaccine. The most common side effects from the human trials of the BA.1 shots was pain, redness, swelling at the injection site, fatigue, headaches, muscle pain, joint pain, chills, nausea, vomiting and fever, according to the FDA. Oliver, the CDC official, told the committee that health officials do not expect any difference in the safety profile of the BA.1 and BA.5 shots given that subvariants differ only by a few mutations. But Oliver noted that the risk of myocarditis following a BA.5 booster shot is unknown. There is an elevated risk of myocarditis among young men and adolescent boys following the second dose of Pfizer's and Moderna's shots but the risk of myocarditis from Covid infection is higher, according to the CDC. \"We know that the myocarditis risk is unknown but anticipate a similar risk to that seen after the monovalent vaccines,\" Oliver said. The monovalent vaccines are the old shots that have been administered to millions of people in the U.S. over the past two years. The original vaccines, which were first authorized in December 2020, are no longer providing meaningful protection against infection because the virus has mutated so much over the past two years. The shots were developed against the first strain that emerged in China, so they are no longer matched to target the omicron subvariants that are spreading. Infections, hospitalizations and deaths have declined dramatically since the massive wave of omicron infection last winter, but have plateaued this summer at a stubbornly high level. Omicron BA.5 is the most contagious and immune evasive variant yet, and breakthrough infections have become increasingly common as a consequence. The old vaccines effectiveness against hospitalization also declined after omicron BA.5 became dominant. A third dose was 77% effective at prevention hospitalization four months after receiving the shot, but protection declined after 120 day to as low as 34%, according to CDC data. A fourth dose in people ages 50 and older was 56% effective at preventing hospitalization after four months. Deaths and hospitalizations from Covid among people ages 65 and older have increased since April, according to Heather Scobie, a CDC epidemiologist who presented data during Thursday's meeting. Deaths have risen in particular among people ages 75 and older, Scobie said. The CDC has shifted to a more targeted public health response with an emphasis on protecting the most vulnerable \u2014 the elderly, people with serious medical conditions and those who have weak immune systems. Although there's no data on the real-world effectiveness of the new boosters, the U.S. is moving rapidly to roll them out in the hope that they will protect people this fall."},

Pfizer's new booster dose is authorized for people ages 12 and older, while Moderna's new shots are authorized for adults ages 18 and older. The eligible age groups can receive the boosters two months after completing their primary series or their most recent booster with the old shots. The U.S. will no longer use the original vaccines as booster doses for individuals ages 12 and older now that the the updated shots have been authorized, according to the FDA. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has to sign off on the boosters before pharmacies can give them to patients. The CDC's independent advisory committee is scheduled to meet Thursday and Friday to review the data and issue its recommendations for health-care providers. Public health officials believe the redesigned boosters will provide longer-lasting protection against the virus and reduce hospitalizations this fall and winter. The new boosters target both the original strain that emerged in China more than two years ago, which scientists refer to as the \"wild type,\" and omicron BA.4 and BA.5, which are now the dominant variants in the U.S. Shots that target two different strains are called bivalent vaccines. The vaccine makers developed the original shots against the strain of Covid that first emerged in Wuhan, China, in 2019. But the virus has mutated dramatically since then. Omicron and its subvariants have drifted so much from the original Covid strain that the virus is able to slip past the protective antibodies induced by the vaccines. As a consequence, the shots' effectiveness at preventing infection and mild illness has declined substantially as the virus has evolved. Though the vaccines are still generally preventing severe disease, the protection they provide against hospitalization has slipped over time as well. \"There is declining effectiveness against hospitalization and severe illness. The problem has been persuading the American people to get boosted on a regular basis,\" said Dr. Peter Hotez, an infectious disease expert at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas. Hotez led a team that developed a Covid vaccine based on protein technology that is authorized in India. About 76% of people ages 12 and older have received their first two vaccine doses in the U.S., according to CDC data. About 50% of those individuals have received their first booster dose. For adults ages 18 and older, three doses of Pfizer's or Moderna's original vaccines were 55% effective at preventing hospitalization from the omicron BA.2 subvariant four months after the third shot, according to CDC data. Three shots were 19% effective at preventing infection from omicron five months after the third shot, according to CDC data from August 2021 through May 2022. The rapidly spreading BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants have since driven omicron BA.2 out of circulation. Dr. Peter Marks, head of the FDA office responsible for reviewing vaccines, said the hope is that the updated boosters will restore the high level of protection against disease that vaccines demonstrated when they were first authorized in December 2020. \"We don't know for a fact yet whether we will get to that same level, but that is the goal here. And that is what we believe the evidence that we've seen helps point to,\" Marks told reporters during a news conference after the authorization Wednesday. The Biden administration moved rapidly over the summer to get updated shots ready for the fall. Public health officials are worried the U.S. is on the verge of another wave of infection as more transmissible omicron variants spread, immunity from the original vaccines wears off, and people head indoors to escape colder weather. Pfizer and Moderna were originally developing boosters to target omicron BA.1, the variant that caused the massive wave of infection last winter. But the FDA told the vaccine makers in late June to switch gears and target BA.4 and BA.5 instead as those variants quickly gained ground. The sudden change in plans left little time for clinical trials in humans before a fall rollout. As a consequence, the authorization is based on human clinical trials from the BA.1 shots, which produced a better immune response than the original doses, according to the FDA. But it's unclear how the BA.5 boosters will perform in humans since the data is based on BA.1. Marks said it will likely be at least another two months before human clinical data on the BA.5 shots is made available to the public. The most common side effects from the human trials of the BA.1 shots was pain, redness, swelling at the injection site, fatigue, headaches, muscle pain, joint pain, chills, nausea, vomiting and fever, according to the FDA. The Covid vaccines also have a well-established safety profile after administration to millions of people over the course of the pandemic, the FDA said. In addition to human data from the BA.1 shots, the authorization was also based on animal studies from the BA.5 boosters, Marks said. In June, Pfizer also presented data to the FDA's independent vaccine advisory committee that showed the bivalent omicron BA.5 shots increased antibodies in mice that protect against infection by about 2.6-fold compared with the original vaccine. Marks said the FDA used the same process for the authorization that it relied on in the past for switching the strains in flu vaccines. \"We're pretty confident that or what we have is very similar to the situation that we've done in the past with influenza changes where we don't do clinical studies for them in the United States,\" Marks said. \"We know from the way the vaccine works, and from the data that we have, that we can predict how well the vaccine will be working.\" But some infectious disease and vaccine experts say the FDA should have waited for human data from the BA.5 shots before authorizing them. Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the FDA's advisory committee, said data based on mice studies is not sufficient to justify authorizing the new boosters. \"You have to show some evidence in people that the immune response that you're getting with the bivalent vaccine is clearly better, and those data haven't been presented,\" said Offit, an infectious disease and vaccine expert at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. \"You can't ask millions of people to get this booster dose without showing some human data that you have a dramatic increase in neutralizing antibodies to the BA.4/BA.5 strains as compared to boosting with the ancestral type,\" Offit said, referring to the currently authorized shots based on the version of Covid that emerged in China, more than two years ago. Michael Osterholm, a leading epidemiologist and director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, also said more data needs to be presented on how the BA.5 shots perform in humans. \"It's not that I don't think it could work,\" Osterholm said. \"But I think we need the data first to show that the immune response to this vaccine is equivalent to or better than what we have already.\" But CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky, in a radio interview, said waiting longer for human data from the BA.5 shots could mean the boosters become outdated if a new variant emerges. Walensky said the change in the vaccine formula is small and should not affect safety. \"There's always a question here of being too slow versus too fast,\" Walensky told \"Conversations on Health Care\" in a radio interview. \"One of the challenges is if we wait for those data to emerge in human data [...] we will be using what I would consider to be a potentially outdated vaccine.\""},

The economy saw growth in all the key sectors and subsectors in August, led by a gain of 68,000 jobs in professional and business services. \"The market will like the broad-based gains in jobs as both goods-producing and services jobs rose in August,\" said Jeffrey Roach, the chief economist for LPL Financial. The strongest areas within professional and business services include computer systems design, management and technical consulting, and architectural and engineering. The sector has now added 1.1 million jobs over the past 12 months, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Health care came in second for the month, with 48,200 jobs added. If health-care jobs were added to education and social services, as some economists do, that broad sector would have matched the 68,000 gain by professional and business services. Retail trade was another bright spot, growing by 44,000 jobs. That was an acceleration from the 29,100 jobs added in July. Even though job growth was positive across the board, it was significantly slower in some areas. Leisure and hospitality, for example, added 31,000 jobs in August after growing by 95,000 in July. The sector is still 1.2 million short of its pre-pandemic level. Transportation and warehousing added just 4,800 jobs after growing by more than 24,000 in July. Roach also pointed to a rise in part-time workers by 225,000, with 69,000 saying they could not find full-time employment, as a potential area of concern going forward."},

In a recent note, Charles Dumas, chief economist at U.K.-based investment research firm TS Lombard, said that action on climate change is often criticized as moving too slowly. However, with governments increasing spending to aid their post-Covid economies, they may start catching up. A key tenet of this is the ever-decreasing cost of electricity per megawatt hour, according to figures from TS Lombard, with costs of solar, offshore and onshore wind dropping over the last 10 years, while gas and coal have remained largely the same. \"Effectively by 2030 the cost of renewable electricity is going to be half that of coal and gas sourced electricity,\" Dumas told CNBC. These trends will bring many of the various pledges to reach net zero more closely in sight. The fatal floods in Germany in recent weeks have put the impacts of climate change firmly in the spotlight again but they are only the latest in a series of devastating extreme weather events of late, including the sprawling wildfires in Oregon. Amid this backdrop, the United Nations Climate Change Conference, better known as COP26, will meet in Glasgow in November. It will mark one of the most significant multilateral meetings on climate since the Paris agreement. Dumas said that as COP26 approaches, governments need to understand their key priorities, and among them should be infrastructure investments as numerous technological and engineering challenges continue to obstruct renewable energy. \"I think the intermittency problem is pretty serious and it's not just that the sun goes down at night,\" Dumas said. In the case of solar power, output can be mixed depending on the location of infrastructure like solar farms. \"There's huge variation with sunny days in winter and sunny days in the middle of summer so the intermittency takes on a very big seasonal aspect,\" Dumas said. \"You can have vicious weather for a long time in the middle of December or January and lo and behold you wouldn't want to be depending on solar power.\" Energy transmission could be another bottleneck, he said. While the developing world, including several African nations, has great potential in developing sites for generating solar power, that power needs to move easily. \"The issue of transmission technology is really major. If you want Chad to be the new Saudi Arabia, because of the Sahara Desert there's a lot of sun there, but you want the electricity to be used in Europe then you're talking about some expensive processes and processes needing a lot of research and a lot of further investment.\" Storage and carbon capture are all areas that require hefty investment, Dumas added, if governments are to reach their net-zero targets. \"What we need is a very clear public policy lead in order to get anywhere near these net zero promises and I suspect that actually what it's going to be about is a carbon tax, which the Americans may resist but will be necessary,\" he said. Paul Steele, chief economist at an independent policy research institute called the International Institute for Environment and Development, said that climate action and renewable energy investments will serve the dual purpose of tackling the climate crisis while creating jobs for the post-Covid economy. \"One of the priorities coming out of Covid is to create labor intensive employment. Both in developed and developing countries, you can provide labor intensive employment through renewable energy,\" Steele said. One example, he said, was the retrofitting of boilers in homes in the U.K., which would help push the country toward its climate targets and create new jobs while being relatively inexpensive in the grand scheme of things. Steele said that investments to drive a climate-friendly economy cannot be short term or have quick goals. He pointed to the various government support schemes for the airline industry, which has been battered by the pandemic. Just this week, the European courts gave the nod to a $2.9 billion bailout for Air France-KLM's Dutch business. Bailout funds like these should be tied to sustainability commitments by the airline industry, he said, but that can be a dicey proposition to get over the line. \"Governments aren't making the connections enough and traditionally treasuries and particularly the ministries of transport are still dominated by road building lobbies and people who like to build highways and increase transport rather than people who want to invest in sustainable alternatives.\"  "},

As economies reopened after the pandemic, companies in the hospitality, retail and entertainment sectors ramped up hiring, said Feon Ang, Asia-Pacific managing director at the professional networking platform. All three countries saw an increase in job postings on LinkedIn for jobs in the accommodation sector, such as hotels, motels, casino hotels and bed-and-breakfast inns. According to data collected by LinkedIn, paid job postings for careers in Australia, India and Singapore increased in June compared to a year ago, with the following sectors seeing the most growth: 1. Accommodation, up 62%\n2. Retail jobs, up 46%\n3. Financial services, up 25% 1. Accommodation, up 65%\n2. Construction, up 40%\n3. Real estate and equipment rental services, up 25% 1. Accommodation, up 15%\n2. Transport and logistics, up 31%\n3. Entertainment providers (businesses involved in performances, events, and exhibitions), up 100% However, jobs in Singapore's health care, education and construction industries were all down by more than 30%, according to LinkedIn. Ang noted that the cutback of job postings for Singapore's construction sector was likely due to measures introduced by the government to cool the private and residential property market. Although there's an increase in hiring rates across the three countries, there was less competition among job seekers in June compared to one year ago, LinkedIn data showed. On average, there was a more than a 50% drop in applications for paid job postings on LinkedIn in Australia, India and Singapore \"Even as job postings rise, workers are being more selective in picking their next role, and so competition for jobs on average is down,\" said Ang. \"This means that workers are in a position to demand more out of work, and have higher expectations of what they want in a job \u2013 and that's a healthy sign,\" she added. In both Australia and Singapore, paid job postings that offered remote work options fell. Paid listings in Australia fell by 8% in June compared to a year ago, although sentiment for flexible working arrangements was still strong. Opportunities that offered remote working options received two times more applications on average, according to LinkedIn. In Singapore, paid job postings that allowed employees to work from home fell from 8% in the first quarter to 6.7% in the second quarter. But unlike employees in Australia, LinkedIn observed that interest in flexible working arrangements seemed to be waning in Singapore. Employers in India felt differently, according to the data. Paid job postings in the South Asian country which offered remote work options remained relatively constant throughout the year and there wasn't particularly more interest in jobs with remote options. \"Postings with remote options received only 1.1x more applications on average relative to their absolute share of all job postings in both quarters,\" said LinkedIn."},

He was speaking at the 2022 Global Supertrends Conference. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced in May that the country will take firm steps to restart idled nuclear power plants to stabilize energy supply and prices. In 2011, the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant was hit by a massive earthquake and tsunami, which killed nearly 16,000 people and caused the world's worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986. Though there have been reservations among the Japanese public over the use of nuclear energy, particularly when it comes to the issue of safety, Tanaka said the future of nuclear power is now safer, and stressed the importance of minimizing risk and maintaining \"peaceful use.\" Tanaka attributed the increase in public support to the possibility of \"serious problems by the end of this year\" if Japan does not have nuclear power. He added that Russia supplies 9% of Japan's natural gas, and losing that supply could spell trouble for the country as it would have to turn to alternative sources, which would lead to a spike in energy prices. Japan has repeatedly criticized Russian aggression in Ukraine and has slapped Moscow with economic sanctions. In response, Russia sanctioned over 300 Japanese lawmakers in July. Russia recently cut gas supplies to Europe via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to just a fifth of its capacity. Moscow has repeatedly denied it is weaponizing fossil fuel supplies over the Russia-Ukraine war. Tanaka said that Japan wants to secure energy supplies but also work toward reaching carbon neutrality by 2050, and striking that balance could prove increasingly challenging. Nuclear power has been touted as an important option for decarbonization.\n\"Japan is trying to secure the supply of energy, especially electricity, while trying to maintain the targets of carbon neutral by 2050 intact.

In April, Baidu and rival robotaxi operator Pony.ai received approval from a Beijing suburban district to operate robotaxis without a human driver. But the Chinese capital still requires human staff to sit in the robotaxi with passengers. Municipal authorities across China have issued an increasing number of permits in the last year that allow robotaxi companies to operate and charge fares in selected areas.

From 1991 to 2000, global insured losses from floods was about $30 billion. In the next decade, global insured losses from floods was $40 billion, and from 2011 to 2020, global insured losses from floods was $80 billion, according to Swiss Re. In the first year of the next decade alone, 2021, insured losses were $20 billion, Swiss Re said. That's only a fraction of the total losses from flooding. In the decade from 2011 to 2020, 82 percent of global economic losses from floods was uninsured, according to Swiss Re. Population growth, the growth of cities, and the increasing intensity of flooding events due to climate change are to blame for the surge in the damage done by floods. \"Climate change is increasing likelihood of high-intensity, heavy rain and short-duration floods events associated with tropical cyclones,\" the report from Swiss Re said. Currently, Pakistan is struggling to recover from deadly floods that have killed more than 1,000 people and injured many more, according to Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the Secretary-General of the United Nations. \"Pakistan is awash in suffering. The Pakistani people are facing a monsoon on steroids \u2014 the relentless impact of epochal levels of rain and flooding,\" Guterres said on Monday. \"As we continue to see more and more extreme weather events around the world, it is outrageous that climate action is being put on the back burner as global emissions of greenhouse gases are still rising, putting all of us \u2013 everywhere \u2013 in growing danger,\" Guterres said. In the United States, almost 40% of the population lives in coastal counties and another 10% in floodplains. \"Despite the private flood insurance market gaining traction over the last few years, too many people are still not covered for flooding and the majority of those impacted by these events are uninsured, leaving them to pick up the pieces at their own expense,\" Keith Wolfe, president of property and casualty for Swiss Re in the US, said in a written statement. Extreme rainfall can cause flooding anywhere, said Swiss Re. \"Flood risk is in a lot more places than your mortgage company tells you,\" Wolfe said. For the insurance industry, the ability to properly insure properties for flooding risk is improving due to better date and more granular risk mapping, Swiss Re said. It's still not perfect, though. The accuracy for measuring flood risk has improved but it still \"remains limited,\" the report said. ."},

While the Massachusetts Department of Revenue hasn't made a final determination, state Rep. Steve Owens, a Democrat, on Wednesday said in a tweet that student loan forgiveness won't be taxable. What's more, the state has already issued guidance on conforming to the American Rescue Plan's exclusion, Owens said in a separate tweet. A state provision to conform with the American Rescue Plan Act's exemption was not approved during the last session of the state legislature, a spokesperson for the Minnesota Department of Revenue told CNBC. \"If the state does not conform to this federal law, then Minnesota taxpayers who have their student debt discharged will have to add back this amount for Minnesota income tax purposes,\" the spokesperson said.

Xpeng President Brian Gu said the guidance reflects the fact that the industry is entering a \"relatively slow season\" and that traffic in stores is less due to the Covid situation. Yanan Shen, president of Li Auto, said in an earnings call last month that the Covid outbreak \"severely affected\" the company's supply chains and that there are remaining \"disruptions and difficulties.\" Shen also said there had been a slowdown in order intake for its flagship Li One sports utility vehicle. Li Auto began to deliver its new L9 car to customers at the end of August. And the company said it is planning to launch and deliver a large SUV called the Li L8 in early November. That could be affecting sales of its Li One, according to Russo. \"Li has major new product launches with the L9 and L8 which is also impacting consumer demand for Li One. When new products come out, demand for the older model often suffers,\" Russo said. To spur demand, China said last month it would extend its tax exemption for new energy vehicle purchases until the end of 2023. Competition continues to heat up in China's electric vehicle market. Alongside Li Auto's new cars, Xpeng plans to begin deliveries of its new G9 SUV in October and launch two new vehicles next year."},

Meanwhile, Black workers marked the only demographic to see their labor force participation fall. The unemployment rate rose 0.2 percentage point to 3.7% in August, according to data released Friday by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Nonfarm payrolls came in at 315,000 and fell in line with estimates of 318,000. While all demographic groups saw the unemployment rate tick up slightly, it rose at a sharper pace for both Hispanic and Black workers to 4.5% and 6.4%, respectively, from 3.9% and 6% in July. However, Black workers marked the only group that saw labor force participation decline, while the group's employment-population ratio, which measures what percentage of the population holds a job, also fell. \"There is some volatility in these numbers but seeing a downward trend in employment and participation is worrisome,\" said Elise Gould, senior economist with the Economic Policy Institute. For August, Black labor force participation fell to 61.8% from 62% in July, while the employment to population ratio dipped to 57.9% from 58.3% William Spriggs, chief economist to the AFL-CIO, said that looking at Black workers is one way to gauge and understand what's really happening among employers. Black workers across the board face more discrimination than many other groups, which could be one explanation, he said. A potential slowdown in hiring \u2014 as evident through this week's ADP private payrolls data \u2014 could also be a contributor to these results. \"When firms slow their hiring rate, that hit Black workers immediately because they're already in line the longest to try and find a job,\" Spriggs said. \"What's happened is the queue's just gotten longer so the discouraged worker effect is much more acute for Black workers. While it's too early to assign a specific cause to the declining labor force participation among Black workers, Gould said the continued downward trend in recent months may signal something other than \"a statistical anomaly.\" That said, the Federal Reserve's campaign to quickly raise rates to tame surging prices may be causing more damage to the labor market, which tends to appear among historically disadvantaged groups like Black workers. \"Black workers are beginning to feel the brunt of it in a disparate fashion,\" said Michelle Holder, a distinguished senior fellow at Washington Center for Equitable Growth. \"Now, this is one report, but I pretty much believe that this is going to be the pattern over the next few months, particularly if the Fed continues to aggressively implement its approach.\" Like others, Holder agrees that it's too early to attribute a cause to the decline in Black labor force participation, but called attention to rising unemployment among Black female workers. The group saw its unemployment rate rise from 5.3% in July to 5.9%. In comparison, white female workers saw their unemployment rate tick up to 2.8% from 2.6%. Hispanic female workers also experienced a sharp increase in their unemployment rate, rising to 4.3% from 3.2% in July. While the unemployment rate did rise at a faster clip among Hispanic workers compared to white workers and the overall jobs market, the group's labor force participation rate and employment trend seem to mimic the broader market, Gould said. \"We're seeing this rise in unemployment as accompanied by a significant increase in participation and then uptake as well in employment,\" she said. \"I think that's a hopeful sign. The fact that the unemployment rate moves up is not a troubling thing on its own.\" \u2014 CNBC's Gabriel Cortes contributed to this report."},

But that didn't stop the state of Mississippi from paying Favre $1.1 million in 2017 and 2018 to make motivational speeches \u2014 out of federal welfare funds intended for needy families. The Mississippi state auditor said Favre never gave the speeches and demanded the money back, with interest. Favre has repaid the fees, although not the $228,000 in interest the auditor also demanded. But the revelation by the auditor that $70 million in TANF welfare funds was doled out to a multimillionaire athlete, a professional wrestler, a horse farm and a volleyball complex are at the heart of a scandal that has rocked the nation's poorest state, sparking parallel state and federal criminal investigations that have led to charges and guilty pleas involving some of the key players. Favre hasn't been accused of a crime or charged, and he declined an interview. His lawyer, Bud Holmes, said he did nothing wrong and never understood he was paid with money intended to help poor children. Holmes acknowledged that Favre had been questioned by the FBI in the case, a fact that hasn't previously been reported. The saga, which has been boiling at low grade for 2\u00bd years, drew new attention in July, when the state welfare agency fired a lawyer who had been hired to claw back some of the money, just after he issued a subpoena seeking more information about the roles of Favre and the former governor, Phil Bryant, a Republican. The current governor, Republican Tate Reeves, acknowledged playing a role in the decision to sack Brad Pigott, accusing the former Bill Clinton-appointed U.S. attorney of having a political agenda. But the state official who first uncovered the misspending and fraud, auditor Shad White, is a Republican. In his first television interview since he was fired, Pigott said his only agenda was to get at the truth and to recoup U.S. taxpayer funds sent to Mississippi that he says were \"squandered.\" \"The notion of tens of millions of dollars that was intended by the country to go to the alleviation of poverty \u2014 and to see it going toward very different purposes \u2014 was appalling to many of us,\" he said. \"Mr. Favre was a very great quarterback, but having been a great NFL quarterback, he is not well acquainted with poverty.\" Pigott, who before he was fired sued on behalf of Mississippi's welfare agency, naming Favre and 37 other grant recipients, laid ultimate blame at the feet of top Mississippi politicians, including Bryant. \"Governor Bryant gave tens of millions of dollars of this TANF welfare money to a nonprofit led by a person who he knew well and who had more connections with his political party than with the good people in Mississippi who have the heart and the skills to actually cajole people out of poverty or prevent teenage pregnancies,\" he said. In an interview with Mississippi Today, Bryant said he never knew the grants came from welfare money. His lawyer didn't respond to requests for comment. The person in charge of the nonprofit group Pigott was referring to is Nancy New, a close friend of Bryant's wife. New and her son have pleaded guilty to state and federal charges and agreed to cooperate. New, a key player in doling out the money, said in a court document that Bryant was among those involved in directing the transactions. Her lawyer declined to comment. The former head of the state welfare agency, John Davis, has pleaded not guilty to state charges of bribery and conspiracy, and law enforcement officials say the investigations continue. Favre defended himself in a series of tweets last year against charges from state auditor White that he accepted state money for speeches he never intended to give. \"I would never knowingly take funds meant to help our neighbors in need, but for Shad White to continue to push out this lie that the money was for no-show events is something I cannot stay silent about,\" Favre tweeted. The speeches aren't the only welfare grants tied to Favre. Text messages obtained by the website Mississippi Today and authenticated by Pigott show that Favre sought a $3.2 million grant to a drug company in which he was a shareholder and a $5 million award that built a volleyball arena at the University of Southern Mississippi, where his daughter played the sport and where he played football. Favre's lawyer declined to comment. The drug company, Prevacus, was touting treatments to mitigate the effects of concussions, although none were approved by the Food and Drug Administration. In some texts, Favre suggested awarding shares in the drug company to Bryant while he was governor. \"Don't know if legal or not but we need cut him in,\" Favre texted a company official in November 2018, referring to Bryant. Following up three days later, Favre wrote, \"Also if legal I'll give some of my shares to the Governor.\" Bryant has said he never would have accepted such an offer. \"All of it remains quite a mystery,\" Pigott told NBC News, \"as to why Mr. Favre would get the benefit of millions of dollars in TANF welfare money, both for a fee for speeches he didn't make, $2 million-plus to go to a company in which he was the largest outside individual investor and $5 million for his alma mater to play volleyball in a volleyball building.\" The state auditor said he found other \"no show\" contracts benefiting former pro athletes and family members of Davis, the welfare agency director. The auditor said Davis directed one contract to Austin Smith, his nephew, who was paid more than $400,000 to provide \"coding skills\" classes even though prosecutors allege he had no such skills \"and did not know how to teach.\" At least $3 million went to Ted DiBiase, a retired professional wrestler. Marcus Dupree, a former college football star, also received $370,000 in welfare funds, which prosecutors say partly went to fund his horse ranch. Paul LaCoste, who is the current governor's athletic trainer, was paid $300,000 in welfare funds to run a fitness boot camp for legislators. DiBiase, Dupree, LaCoste and Smith didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. The scandal has also spotlighted the meager scope of Mississippi's welfare program and provided a stark reminder of the Clinton-era welfare reform that provided states with block grants and wide latitude in how they spend it. According to state figures, Mississippi rejects more than 90% of those who apply for the federal welfare benefit known as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF. This year 2,500 children received benefits, state officials said, in a state with 192,000 poor children. One of those who had trouble getting help was Tamara Edwards, who raised four children on her own while working a series of low-wage jobs. She once received welfare vouchers for child care, and in 2009 she applied again, she said. Even though her income was low enough, she was denied. \"They told me they didn't have the funds,\" said Edwards, who now works as a cook at a Cracker Barrel restaurant. Advocates and state legislators say Mississippi's welfare agency, under years of conservative Republican state governments, has a history of questionable spending and a lack of transparency. \"TANF has been a slush fund for a long time,\" said Oleta Fitzgerald, who is the director of the Children's Defense Fund's Southern Regional Office and is based in Jackson, the state capital. \"Mississippi is the poorest doggone state in the country \u2014 where is the money, and what are they doing with it? There is nobody on welfare \u2014 welfare participation rates are way down \u2014 and no one knows where that money is being spent.\" Aisha Nyandoro, the chief executive of Springboard to Opportunities, a local nonprofit group that works with residents of affordable housing, said: \"And DHS [the state Department of Human Services] will tell you that the reason that they cannot go about allocating the TANF funds is because they can't find any families who are eligible. Go outside and throw a rock. It's Mississippi. You can find an eligible family.\" Jarvis Dortsch, a former state legislator who heads the state's chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, said that when he was a member of the Legislature, \"I could not get a list of how the money was being spent.\" Dortsch said he had to resort to secrecy. \"Someone had snuck me a list \u2014 it didn't have [a] DHS [logo] on it \u2014 they had it printed out and snuck it out,\" he said. Shad White, the auditor, told NBC News the investigation goes on. \"My office is continuing the work we started over two years ago on what is now the largest public fraud case in our state's history,\" he said. \"We will also continue to work with our state and federal partners to be sure each person responsible for this massive scheme is held fully accountable under the law.\""},

These days? Not so much. The average new-car discount offered by manufacturers is down an estimated 47.1% from a year ago to $969, according to a recent forecast from J.D. Power and LMC Automotive. August marked the fourth consecutive month of incentives trending below $1,000. More from Personal Finance:\nHere's how to combat inflation with Labor Day deals\n50% of employers expect job cuts, survey finds\nAmericans spend $314 a month on impulse purchases At the same time, the average price for a new car reached an estimated $46,259 in August \u2014 11.5% higher than a year ago and the highest on record, according to the J.D. Power/LMC forecast. \"Shoppers waiting for Labor Day sales events with substantial discounts on outgoing model-year vehicles will be frustrated by the lack of markdowns and choice of vehicles,\" said Thomas King, president of the data and analytics division at J.D. Power, in the report. However, even as the average sales price for a new car continues pushing higher, Labor Day deal shoppers may find a general easing in prices for used vehicles. \"Car shoppers can't expect to find anything close to the doorbuster bargains of pre-pandemic Labor Day sales, but they can at least look forward to used car prices softening across the board heading into the holiday weekend,\" said Jessica Caldwell, executive director of insights at Edmunds. \"Although these price drops are not earth-shattering, they should be a welcome reprieve for consumers compared to the continued higher cost of new car purchases or leases,\" Caldwell said. As the calendar gets closer to 2023, used vehicles are getting older and racking up more mileage, so they generally are selling for less than they did earlier in the year, according to Edmunds. Additionally, an uptick in the number of near-new cars (no more than 2 years old) making their way to the used market via trade-ins is pushing down the price of 3-year-old vehicles. The average sales price for 3-year-old vehicles was $31,302 in July, down 4.6% from their peak of $32,828 in January. Across more than 200 models in that age group, 92.8% have experienced a price decline this year. For instance, a 2019 Ford Fusion Energi, a plug-in hybrid electric car, sold for an average $17,514 in July. That's a $3,776 drop \u2014 17.7% \u2014 from its $21,290 peak in March. For a 2019 GMC Yukon, a full-size SUV, the average price in July was $50,478, which is $6,602 lower, or 11.6%, than its high of $57,080 in January. There's also good news for those trading in a used car for one of those pricey new ones. The average trade-in in August was worth an estimated $10,011, a 32.7% jump from a year ago and the third consecutive month above $10,000, according to the J.D. Power/LMC report. The auto industry continues to operate in a challenging environment due to supply chain issues, including a persistent shortage of computer chips. That shortage has led to elevated prices in both the new and used markets as consumer demand remains strong. In August, an estimated 55% of vehicles were sold within 10 days of arriving at a dealership, according to the J.D. Power/LMC Automotive. The average number of days that new cars are on a dealer's lot before being sold is about 20 days, down from 25 days during the year-earlier period."},

Already reeling from an economic crisis, flood waters have submerged over one third of the country in water, killing over 1,000 and impacting 33 million people. Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, the country's foreign minister, told CNBC's Dan Murphy Thursday that he fears the damages from the natural disaster will exceed current estimates of $10 billion, adding that the crisis in the country is still ongoing and in the \"rescue and relief phase.\" The flooding, which Bhutto Zardari told CNBC is \"a climate disaster of biblical proportions,\" covers over 95,000 square miles of land. Bhutto Zardari said the crisis is far from over, as \"southern areas of Pakistan are still bracing themselves for the flooding to come through the rivers from the north.\" \"Pakistan at this point in time, are paying in their lives and in their livelihoods for a climate disaster that is not of their making,\" he said. Pakistan's contribution to global carbon emissions is less than 1%, but it's among the 10 most affected countries in the world by climate change. The South Asian nation of over 220 million people reported a 27% inflation rate for August, according to government data, and was hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic. Its currency has tanked while net foreign reserves have dwindled to just $8 billion in August, according to the State Bank of Pakistan. Political infighting has gripped the country since April, after the ousting of former Prime Minister Imran Khan, who has been charged under anti-terror laws by Pakistan's police. Rural areas in Pakistan have been hit the hardest by flooding, which will have a compounded impact on Pakistan's farming industry, and ultimately the cost of food. Bhutto Zardari told CNBC \"about 80 to 90%\" of Pakistan's crops have been damaged by the floods. The International Rescue Committee report that 4 million acres of crops have been destroyed with 800,000 livestock perishing. Prior to the disaster, food inflation in rural provinces was much higher compared to urban areas. For instance, the cost of onions in Pakistan's urban areas increased by 89% from July 2021 to July 2022. In rural areas, that cost increase topped 100%. The International Monetary Fund on Monday approved the release of $1.1 billion to Pakistan in special drawing rights, a part of its bailout program which began in 2019. The money was already part of a relief program to help Pakistan stabilize its economy. Pakistan has now launched a joint appeal with the United Nations for about $160 million, which Bhutto Zardari told CNBC \"is obviously a very conservative estimate about the bare minimum requirements at this moment.\" Over a million homes have been destroyed, and Bhutto Zardari added that key infrastructure like bridges, road networks, and dams have been damaged. Pakistan going forward, he says, will need \"large scale reconstruction, which will require a lot of work.\""},

The majority wrote, \"when an employer interferes in any way with its employees' right to display union insignia, the employer must prove special circumstances that justify its interference.\" Tesla did not demonstrate special circumstances that justified its policy, the NLRB decided. Tesla had previously argued before the NLRB that its dress code was meant to prevent workers' clothing from \"causing mutilations\" to the cars or car seats they were building, and to help managers \"easily determine that employees are in their assigned work areas,\" of the company's factory.

Variety reported that Wojcicki sent an internal memo to YouTube employees on Monday noting that under his leadership, \"YouTube forged new relationships and partnerships in music, traditional media and tech,\" while paying \"more than $30B to creators, artists and media companies in the last 3 years.\" Kyncl's experience at Netflix and YouTube made him a go-to source for legacy media executives, including former Disney CEO Bob Iger, who have transitioned their businesses to focus on direct-to-consumer streaming services. Incoming CBO Mary Ellen Coe has served as Google's president of global customer solutions since early 2017, and has been working at Google since 2012. Prior to her tenure with the search giant, she was a partner at McKinsey. She also served on the boards of multi-national healthcare company Merck, and grocery business Whole Foods Markets before it was acquired by Amazon. Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.   "},

The Japanese gaming giant launched PlayStation Studios Mobile Division on Monday and said it will run independently of the console business. Sony also said on Monday it acquired Helsinki- and Berlin-based mobile game developer Savage Game Studios. The move comes after a tough second quarter for Sony's gaming division, and the company's downgrading of its full-year profit forecast for the business as the Covid-induced boom \u2014 during which people were stuck at home playing video games \u2014 begins to fade. Sony also continues to face supply chain issues and cannot meet the demand for its flagship PlayStation 5 console. Sony has dominated the console market for several years, thanks to the PlayStation. But the company is now looking to diversify. This year, the Japanese gaming giant said it plans to release around 50% of games on PC and mobile by 2025, up from about a quarter currently. \"For that to happen, Sony needs to make big bets on mobile gaming,\" Serkan Toto, CEO of Tokyo-based game industry consultancy Kantan Games, told CNBC. And the opportunity is big. Consoles account for about 27% of the $196.8 billion games market, whereas mobile makes up more than half of revenues, according to Newzoo. The purchase of Savage Game Studios continues Sony's recent acquisition drive as it looks to boost the development of titles across platforms. \"PlayStation Studios must continue to expand and diversify our offering beyond console, bringing incredible new games to more people than ever before,\" said Hermen Hulst, head of PlayStation studios. \"Acquiring the talented team at Savage Game Studios is another strategic step towards that goal.\" Sony said that Savage Game Studios is working on an \"unannounced new AAA mobile live service action game.\" A \"triple A\" game is an informal industry classification usually for a blockbuster type of title. A live service game is usually a title where developers continually update and add content to extend its lifetime and generate revenue over a longer period of time. The success of Call of Duty Mobile and Diablo Immortal on mobile, both of which were originally designed for console and PC, show there is demand for well-known titles on smaller screens \"if executed well,\" according to Daniel Ahmad, senior analyst at Niko Partners. Sony's mobile strategy is likely to lean on its massive library of intellectual property (IP) but also with a focus on developing specific games for smaller devices, Kantan Games' Toto said. \"Sony is very likely to not only bring existing PlayStation IPs to mobile but also encourage studios to develop new franchises for smart devices from scratch,\" Toto said. Sony is the latest console maker to make a big step into mobile gaming. Microsoft's Xbox gaming unit has also begun making early moves into mobile. Nintendo has, for the last three years, also been focusing a lot of effort on the smaller screen gaming format. Globally, Sony will compete with companies it hadn't really before, particularly Chinese giants Tencent and NetEase \u2014 two of the world's largest mobile gaming players. But Toto said Sony's chances of success are still high. \"The mobile gaming market is overcrowded. There are over 1 million games in app stores nowadays. But players such as Sony, even if they are new entrants, can still make it just because of their fire power,\" Toto told CNBC. \"There are not many companies like Sony out there, with such strong branding, a whole range of high-performing studios and a treasure trove of valuable IPs.\""},

The crash on June 3 i nvolved a Cruise vehicle, which does not require a human driver, braking harshly while making an unprotected left turn as an oncoming vehicle traveling about 40 mph \u2014 15 mph above the speed limit \u2014 switched from a right-turn lane to travel through the intersection. In public filings, federal regulators said the recalled software may \"incorrectly predict another vehicle's path or be insufficiently reactive to the sudden path change of a road user.\" Cruise said a software update in July was conducted to address the problem. Following the crash, Cruise said its robotaxi fleet continued to operate but that it temporarily prevented the vehicles from making unprotected left turns. It said it gradually reintroduced unprotected left turns after the software update. The crash was especially notable because it occurred a day after California regulators granted Cruise permission to commercialize its robotaxi fleet. It also happened amid increased scrutiny by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, part of the Department of Transportation, involving such vehicles and advanced driver-assist systems. Commercializing autonomous vehicles has been far more challenging than many predicted even a few years ago. The challenges have led to a consolidation in the autonomous vehicle sector after years of enthusiasm touting the technology as the next multitrillion-dollar market for transportation companies. In June, Cruise became the first company to offer unmanned fared rides to the public in a major city. The company for several years had been testing the vehicles, which are modified Chevrolet Bolt EVs, and was offering limited, non-fared rides to the public before then. The June crash was the only such incident in more than 123,560 driverless unprotected left turns prior to the software update, according to Cruise. The report also noted that law enforcement found the \"party at most fault\" for the collision was the other vehicle, according to the filings. When the crash occurred, the Cruise vehicle \"had to decide between two different risk scenarios and chose the one with the least potential for a serious collision at the time, before the oncoming vehicle's sudden change of direction,\" according to Cruise. In July, NHTSA said it was investigating the incident, with the assistance of Cruise, a majority-owned subsidiary of GM."},

The company will invest up to $1 billion in the new factory, which it plans to build in the Southeast of the U.S. The newly announced plant will be the panel maker's fourth fully integrated U.S. factory. First Solar also said Tuesday that it will spend $185 million upgrading and expanding its existing facilities in Ohio. CEO Mark Widmar pointed to the IRA as the key catalyst that made the company decide to build another factory in the U.S. rather than looking elsewhere. The funding packages create, for the first time, a \"long-term view and understanding of the industry, and policies aligned to that industry,\" he told CNBC. \"With that level of clarity, we stepped back and evaluated the alternatives or the options of where we could go with our next factory and when we looked at it comprehensively the U.S. was a very attractive option,\" he said. Widmar added that this is the first time the entire supply chain has been incentivized, from the manufacturer to the generating asset and finally to the end customer. \"With that type of alignment, you can create partnerships and opportunities to grow together collectively and more of a win-win type of structure than maybe we had before the implementation of the IRA,\" he said. First Solar said the new factory will manufacture 3.5 gigawatts of solar modules annually by 2025, with the company's Ohio facilities posting cumulative annual production capacity of over 7 GW by 2025. By comparison, the U.S. added 3.9 GW of solar capacity during the first quarter of 2022, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. The country's total solar industry now stands at 126.1 GW, which is enough to power 22 million homes, according to SEIA. Shares of First Solar have surged 65% since the end of July when Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V. announced their surprise agreement on the climate, health care and tax bill. The legislation, which swiftly passed the House and Senate and was signed into law by President Joe Biden, benefits First Solar in several ways, including through the production tax credit for domestic manufacturers. First Solar is the largest U.S.-based developer of solar panels, with a focus on utility-scale panels. The factory announcement comes as First Solar struggles to keep pace with booming demand. During its second quarter earnings call, First Solar said it's sold out through 2025, with a backlog of 44 GW. Widmar said First Solar wants to move quickly when building out its new factory. One of the company's considerations is a site that's as close to shovel-ready as possible. Other factors include the type and availability of workers in the area. First Solar is aiming to have identified the site by the end of the current quarter. \"I think the industry is in the best position it ever has been\u2026for growth beyond any expectations that anyone would have envisioned,\" Widmar said."},

In the forthcoming book, \"Like, Comment, Subscribe: Inside YouTube\u2019s Chaotic Rise to World Domination,\" author Mark Bergen writes that the executive, known for being loyal to Google cofounders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, talked about becoming Tesla's Chief Operating Officer before becoming YouTube CEO in 2014. At the time, Wojcicki had been senior vice president of ads and commerce at Google and had been looking for a higher-level role, the book said, citing those close to her. \u201cBy then, Page had begun plotting his own exit \u2014 a plan to hand Google off to a trusted deputy, Sundar Pichai,\" Bergen reports. In a conversation, Laszlo Bock, Google's HR chief at the time, said he \"suggested Page could more easily clear the way for his chosen successor by moving Wojcicki to YouTube.\u201d The announcement of Wojcicki's appointment came as a shock to many Googlers, the book says. Wojcicki had one of the earliest connections to Google -- in 1998, she famously let Page and Brin, who still hold majority shareholder voting power of Google parent company Alphabet, work from her garage when they were starting the company. Her sister, 23andMe founder Anne Wojcicki was married and had kids with Brin. In the book, Bock compared Google to a family enterprise, and the book says Wojcicki often was able to get Page's attention. \u201cWhen people couldn\u2019t get him to see reason, she always could,\u201d said former Google director and early Silicon Valley workplace influencer Kim Scott, who referred to her in the book as \u201ca Larry whisperer.\u201d One example is how Google used search data. \"Wojcicki wanted to use search queries to inform ads people saw on all those banner ads Google ran across the web; if advertisers could target consumers based on searches and on websites, they might spend gobs more with Google,\" the book says. Page had long wanted to keep search data from everything else but Wojcicki \"felt this wasn\u2019t keeping up with trends in the ad industry, which sought ever more data.\u201d \u201cThe founders trust Susan maybe more than anybody on the planet,\" Patrick Keane, an early Google sales director, said in the book. \u201cYou could never get Susan rattled, no matter how challenging the moment was.\u201d YouTube was also discussed as a potential spinout, the book reports. The year after Wojcicki\u2019s appointment, in 2015, Larry Page, announced the creation of Alphabet, a new holding company, that would separate several businesses, including self-driving car Waymo and health sciences unit Verily, from Google. \u201cYouTube seemed like a natural splinter; it already operated with a different name and office,\" the book states. \"Leaders there considered plans to become a separate Alphabet unit, detached from Google. Wojcicki wanted to keep reporting to Page, who had appointed himself Alphabet CEO, rather than his successor at Google, Sundar Pichai. But ultimately it was decided YouTube was too intertwined with Google\u2019s business and machinery to leave. So it stayed at Google.\" Under Wojcicki's watch, YouTube grew to reach more than 81% of U.S. adults and generate nearly $29 billion in revenue in 2021."},

Google said the app lacks effective systems for moderating user-generated content, which violates the store's terms of service. \"On Aug. 19, we notified Truth Social of several violations of standard policies in their current app submission and reiterated that having effective systems for moderating user-generated content is a condition of our terms of service for any app to go live on Google Play,\" the tech company, which is owned by Alphabet, told CNBC in a statement Tuesday. Axios first reported the Google statement. The restriction means that Android users, who make up 44% of smartphone users in the U.S., can't download the app. Google will not let the app go live until the content issues are addressed. Truth Social acknowledged Google's concerns and said it would work on addressing these issues, according to Axios. Trump Media and Technology Group CEO Devin Nunes told a different story. The former lawmaker, who was one of former President Donald Trump's staunchest allies in Congress, said the decision is up to Google and not dependent on Truth Social's policies. \"When are we going to be available on Android? Well, look, that's up to the Google Play store. We're waiting on them to approve us, I don't know what's taking so long,\" Nunes said on the \"Just the News Not Noise\" podcast. \"It sure would be nice if they would approve us.\" Google said that Nunes' statements misrepresent the ongoing dialogue between Trump Media and the Play store. Google reiterated that Truth Social's violations, and the steps to redress them, have been clearly communicated with the company. Trump Media pushed back, saying Truth Social was creating a \"vibrant, family-friendly environment.\" \"TMTG has no desire to litigate its business matters in the public sphere, but for the record, has promptly responded to all inquiries from Google,\" the company said in a press release Tuesday. \"It is our belief that all Americans should have access to Truth Social no matter what devices they use. We look forward to Google approving Truth Social at their earliest convenience.\" Trump Media and Technology Group made the app available for preorder on Android in early August. It is available on Apple's App Store. Google's YouTube has suspended Trump's channel. Android users can still access Truth Social through the platform's website. The restriction is one of several obstacles faced by the former president's app. Truth Social was created as a \"free-speech\" alternative to Twitter, after Trump was banned from the platform for his tweets relating to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Hundreds of the president's supporters stormed the building that day to try to block Congress from confirming Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election. Trump, who had about 88 million followers on Twitter, has about 4 million followers on Truth Social, where he continues to push false claims about the election. He is facing a criminal investigation over secret government records he took with him to his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida and is considering another run for the White House. Trump Media was set to go public through a merger with Digital World Acquisition Corporation, a special-purpose acquisition company. The deadline is Sept. 8, although DWAC is pushing for a delay of up to a year. DWAC warned shareholders that a decline in the former president's popularity could hurt the app and that, without a delay, the acquisition company may have to liquidate. DWAC scheduled a shareholder meeting for Sept. 6, two days before the current merger deadline. Shares of the company were down more than 2% Tuesday at $24.65, far from their peak of about $97 in March."},

The National Labor Relations Board said Thursday that the Amazon Labor Union's winning effort to unionize a Staten Island, New York, warehouse should be upheld.

Twitter shares were down more than 1% in premarket trade. The latest filings come after Twitter's former head of security, Peiter \"Mudge\" Zatko, earlier this month alleged\"extreme, egregious deficiencies\" by the social media company related to privacy, security and content moderation. On July 8, Musk 's legal team initially filed a notice with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to terminate the Twitter acquisition. Musk's team alleged that \"Twitter has not complied with its contractual obligations.\" The follow-up notice, disclosed to the SEC, cites allegations made by Zatko as additional reasons to terminate the deal. \"Allegations regarding certain facts, known to Twitter prior to and as of July 8, 2022, but undisclosed to the Musk Parties prior to and at that time, have since come to light that provide additional and distinct bases to terminate the Merger Agreement,\" Mike Ringler, Musk's legal representative from Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, wrote in a letter to Twitter's legal chief, Vijaya Gadde. Ringler said in the letter that the latest termination notice is \"not legally necessary\" to end the merger deal, but is being delivered in case the July 8 filing is \"determined to be invalid for any reason.\" The letter on behalf of Musk said the Zatko complaint \"alleges far-reaching misconduct at Twitter\u2014all of which was disclosed to Twitter's directors and senior executives, including (CEO) Parag Agrawal\u2014that is likely to have severe consequences for Twitter's business.\" Musk's lawyer said Zatko alleges that Twitter is in \"material noncompliance\" with its obligations under its 2011 agreement with the Federal Trade Commission. The letter laid out some of Zatko's other allegations including claims that Twitter is \"uniquely vulnerable to systemic disruption resulting from data center failures or malicious actors,\" something senior management knew about but \"ignored and sought to obfuscate.\" \"These allegations, if true, demonstrate that Twitter has breached the following provisions of the Merger Agreement, thereby giving the Musk Parties the right to terminate the Merger Agreement pursuant to its terms,\" the letter said. Twitter's legal team responded on Tuesday by sending a letter to Musk's legal representatives. Twitter said Musk's termination case is \"invalid and wrongful under\" the acquisition agreement. \"It is based solely on statements made by a third party that, as Twitter has previously stated, are riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies and lack important context,\" the letter written by William Savitt of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz law firm said. \"Contrary to the assertions in your letter, Twitter has breached none of its representations or obligations under the Agreement, and Twitter has not suffered and is not likely to suffer a Company Material Adverse Effect.\" Twitter said it intends to enforce the acquisition agreement and \"close the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon\" with Musk. Twitter's legal team said Musk's latest notice to terminate the deal is \"invalid for the independent reason that Mr. Musk and the other Musk Parties continue to knowingly, intentionally, willfully, and materially breach\" the acquisition agreement. The social media giant has previously responded to Zatko. In a memo to staff posted to Twitter on Aug. 23 by CNN correspondent Donie O'Sullivan, Agrawal described Zatko as \"a former Twitter executive who was terminated in January 2022 for ineffective leadership and poor performance.\" Zatko's attorneys issued a statement on Monday in response to that characterization, saying he \"put his career on the line because of his concerns about Twitter users, the public, and the company's shareholders.\" Twitter and Musk will go on trial on Oct. 17 in Delaware to resolve Musk's attempt to cancel his acquisition of the company unless they reach a settlement first. Since proposing the Twitter takeover, Musk has complained that the number of fake or spam accounts on the social media platform is higher than is being disclosed. In the July 8 letter, Musk's legal team claimed the company had \"failed or refused to provide\" information on these accounts to the Tesla CEO. Ahead of the October trial, Musk's legal team has subpoenaed Zatko, seeking information on the company's spam accounts and its alleged security vulnerabilities. \u2014 CNBC's Lora Kolodny contributed to this report."},

In a series of letters sent Tuesday morning, the committee asked four agencies, including the Department of the Treasury, the Federal Trade Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as five digital asset exchanges \u2014 Coinbase, FTX, Binance.US, Kraken, and KuCoin \u2014 for information and documents about what they are doing, if anything, to safeguard consumers against scams and combat cryptocurrency-related fraud. More than $1 billion in crypto has been lost to fraud since the start of 2021, according to research from the FTC. \"As stories of skyrocketing prices and overnight riches have attracted both professional and amateur investors to cryptocurrencies, scammers have cashed in,\" wrote Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D.-Ill., Chair of the Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy. \"The lack of a central authority to flag suspicious transactions in many situations, the irreversibility of transactions, and the limited understanding many consumers and investors have of the underlying technology make cryptocurrency a preferred transaction method for scammers.\" The letters ask that the federal agencies and crypto exchanges respond by Sept. 12 with information about what they are doing to protect consumers. The committee says that these responses could be used to craft legislative solutions. In particular, the letters ask that the exchanges produce documents dating back through Jan. 1, 2009, which display efforts to combat crypto scams and fraud, as well as show attempts made to \"identify, investigate, and remove or flag potentially fraudulent digital assets or accounts,\" as well as highlight discussions around \"whether to adopt more stringent policies.\" In one letter, addressed to Sam Bankman-Fried, the CEO and founder of FTX, the committee notes that \"while some exchanges review cryptocurrencies before listing them, others allow digital assets to be listed with little or no vetting.\" Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis found that 37% of crypto scam revenue last year went to \"rug pulls,\" a type of scheme that involves developers listing a token on an exchange, pumping it up, and then vanishing with the funds. Binance.US, which also received an inquiry from the committee on Tuesday, has been accused in a class action lawsuit of misleading consumers about the safety of investing in the U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin known as terraUSD (or UST, for short) and its sister token, luna. At their height, luna and UST had a combined market value of almost $60 billion. Now, they're essentially worthless. Concern over the safety of crypto funds parked on centralized platforms has also been gaining traction following the recent collapse of Voyager Digital and Celsius, both popular apps among retail traders because of the double-digit annual percentage yield once offered by the two companies. The subsequent bankruptcies of these two platforms have highlighted the question of who owns cryptocurrency assets when a custodial business goes belly up. In the bankruptcy proceedings of both Voyager and Celsius, customers are considered unsecured creditors, rather than federally-insured bank depositors, meaning there is no guarantee they will get any of their money back. As for the relationship between investor and crypto exchange, the terms and conditions vary. In a financial filing released in May, Coinbase said its users would be treated as \"general unsecured creditors\" in the event of bankruptcy. Krishnamoorthi also noted that the agencies often seem to be acting at cross-purposes and giving inconsistent guidance to private-sector players. \"Without clear definitions and guidance, agencies will continue their infighting and will be unable effectively to implement consumer and investor protections related to cryptocurrencies and the exchanges on which they are traded.\""},

The Hangzhou, China-headquartered firm bought Quantic Dream, marking the establishment of its first fully owned gaming studio in Europe. NetEase and its rival Tencent have been upping their efforts overseas as the Chinese domestic games market slows down amid tighter regulation. Over the years, Tencent has been prolific in acquisitions and investments in overseas gaming companies. NetEase is now catching up. This year alone, NetEase has set up gaming studios in Japan and the U.S. NetEase has typically been focused on PC and mobile gaming, extremely popular formats in China. Mobile gaming makes up more than half of its global games revenues. But more recently, the tech giant has been expanding into console games. Quantic Dream, a 25-year-old studio, will focus \"on creating and publishing its video games on all platforms, as well as supporting and publishing third-party developed titles,\" according to a press release. That highlights NetEase's intention to grow across mobile, PC and consoles. The acquisition of Quantic Dream is in line with NetEase's strategy of acquiring well-known international characters and franchises. Quantic Dream is currently developing a game called Star Wars Eclipse, based on Disney's space adventure movies. NetEase has already released mobile games based on the Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter. NetEase's international push comes as regulators in China continue to scrutinize the games market, though there are signs of some easing. Last year, authorities restricted the amount of time those under 18 years old could play online games and froze the approval of new titles. In China, games need the green light from regulators to be released and monetized. Those approvals restarted in April. In an interview with CNBC last year, Hu Zhipeng, vice president at NetEase and one of the top bosses of the technology giant's video games business, said that he aims to eventually have 50% of the company's gaming revenue come from overseas, up from around 10% now. Competition in the global games market is heating up. Sony, a leader in console gaming and producer of the PlayStation, announced on Tuesday that it is setting up a dedicated mobile division, which will put it in competition with the likes of Chinese giants Tencent and NetEase."},

It's also working with dairy farmers to help them reduce emissions produced on their farms. While electricity and transportation tend to get most of the attention when it comes to global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, agriculture is a massive contributor. Breakthrough Energy Ventures has segmented global emissions into five categories, and agriculture is the third worst offender, responsible for 19% of total greenhouse gas emissions, behind manufacturing (31%) and electricity (27%), but ahead of transportation (16%) and buildings (7%). Neutral Foods milk is in about 2,000 grocery stores and has already received funding from a diverse roster of celebrity investors, including Mark Cuban, NBA stars LeBron James and Kevin Love, Tobias Harris, and musicians John Legend and Questlove. The company is planning to expand into butter, and eventually meat. \"It's clear that consumers are hungry for sustainable, climate-forward options and they're reflecting that in their purchasing decisions, especially when it comes to buying food and beverages,\" Carmichael Roberts, one half of the investing committee at Bill Gates' investment fund, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, told CNBC. Neutral Foods measures the carbon emissions of the entire lifecycle of its products and purchases carbon offsets for the measured emissions, Ann Radil, the Head of Carbon Reduction at Neutral Foods, told CNBC. Carbon credits are permits that businesses buy to certify greenhouse gasses have been removed from the atmosphere. While not all carbon credits are reliably policed, Neutral Foods says it uses only offsets verified by Climate Action Reserve (CAR), which it says are quite strict. CAR offsets are \"real, additional, permanent, verifiable, and enforceable,\" said Lauren Brown, senior manager of carbon reduction data and analytics for Neutral Foods. Long-term, the company's plan is to work with farms to reduce their greenhouse emissions directly. Currently, Neutral Foods has eight distinct projects underway at farms it works with and 30 projects in some phase of development, Radil told CNBC. Those projects include changing what cows eat and changing how cow manure is managed. Separating and composting manure \"alone can reduce manure-related GHG emissions like methane and nitrous oxide by 19 to 50 percent,\" Radil told CNBC. Also, Neutral Foods is working with farms to change the way they plant things on the farm to improve the amount of carbon that gets absorbed by the soil. The start-up both guides farmers to help them make changes in the operations on their farms to reduce emissions and then also provides the financing to make those changes, explains CEO Marcus Lovell Smith. Helping farmers lower the emissions on their farms requires approaching farmers with respect. \"You don't go onto a farm and tell a farmer what to do,\" said Smith, who runs his own dairy farm in New Hampshire. \"Farmers are one of the most independent minded groups of people in the country. So I learned that pretty quickly.\" One partner is Groeneveld Farms, a dairy farm with 240 cows, located in Snohomish County, Washington. The farm grows 90% of its feed, and Neutral Foods has helped it figure out how to plant two different crops -- corn and grass -- at the same time.This process, sometimes known as \"co-cropping\" or \"relay cropping\" means the farm only has to till the ground once, which decreases the amount of fossil fuels used on the farm. \"We can do this in a way that works really well for where we are located here in Washington,\" Groeneveld told CNBC. \"Neutral found this appealing and it's something that works within both of our collective budgets to try out.\" Neutral Foods started its product line with milk, which it currently sells at Amazon -owned Whole Foods, Target stores on the West Coast, Sprouts, and various other grocers. The price of Neutral Foods is \"pretty much in the middle of the pack for organic milk,\" CEO Smith said. Results so far are positive. \"We are pleased with how customers are reacting and purchasing the Neutral Foods products. Based on that, we are looking at other opportunities to expand with them into other items,\" said Sprouts spokesperson Steve Nieto. Starting in August, Neutral Foods will start selling carbon neutral pasture-raised butter, and it's planning to expand its product repertoire to include beef as well. Carman Ranch, located in the Wallowa Valley in northeast Oregon, raises cows and hogs. Owner Cory Carman, reached out to Neutral Foods to see they were working on any carbon emissions tracking programs for beef. \"We know that there are so many innovations in agriculture that can make a huge difference in greenhouse gas emissions or carbon sequestration, but discovering how those innovations play out in specific regions, or testing new ones is incredibly hard for individual ranchers,\" Carman told CNBC. Carman Ranch is what is called a \"century farm\" because the same family has worked the farm for over a hundred years. Cory herself grew up on the ranch and has worked at the ranch for the last two decades. \"Neutral has helped bring us technology, resources, and information that I would never had access to and that I am now sharing across my network.\" Carman Ranch has learned about feed supplements for cattle that lower the methane that cows belch out when they digest their food, Carman told CNBC. Currently, Carman Ranch is running trials with Neutral Foods to plant feed for their cows to graze on that contain condensed tannins. \"They are nutritious to our animals, promote soil health and can lower methane emissions,\" Carman told CNBC. Carman Ranch is also running a trial with Neutral Foods to put a seaweed supplement into the feed for 50 cattle. For this pilot program, Neutral Foods and the company making the seaweed supplement, Symbrosia, \"will bring leading researchers, partners, equipment, and procedures to measure methane emissions and weight gain, conduct a full life cycle analysis, and generate verified carbon credits,\" Carman said. It will take time for the projects Neutral Foods is doing with farms to be fully implemented and measurably reduce the emissions of their products, Radil told CNBC. But for now, Gates' investment fund is encouraged by the steps Neutral Foods is making. \"It sends a critical price signal to farmers that climate-forward practices have value. As they continue to improve upon those decarbonization techniques, there's an opportunity for scale at the farm level that can mirror the brand's growth and retail expansion,\" Roberts told CNBC. Fellow investor Marc Cuban, who put money into the company last October, agrees. \"I think consumers are becoming increasingly concerned about the impact of the products they consume on the environment,\" Cuban told CNBC. \"I think Neutral is well positioned to meet that demand.\""},

The move sees the former NASA chief throw his experience and reputation behind a startup with a unique propellant technology. Bridenstine has joined up with larger, established organizations since leaving the space agency. Bridenstine served at NASA during former President Donald Trump's administration, and now holds a variety of roles within the space industry \u2013 including as senior advisor to private equity group Acorn Growth, and on the boards of Viasat and The Aerospace Corp. El Segundo, California-based Phase Four builds next-generation electric thrusters for small satellites, with six operating in orbit so far. The company has raised about $30 million in funding since its founding in 2015. Bridenstine told CNBC that Phase Four's approach of using radio frequency to utilize a wide variety of propellant types \u2013 including xenon, krypton, iodine and water \u2013 is \"going to be an absolute game changer for these proliferated [low Earth orbit satellite] constellations.\" Phase Four's propellant flexibility gives the company stability in the face of a geopolitical threat, Bridenstine said. Noble gases xenon and krypton \u2014 often used as spacecraft propellants \u2014 are \"not widely available\" and largely produced in Russia, Ukraine and China. \"The idea that we can get away from those traditional fuels and get into things like iodine and water, I think [should] significantly drop costs and create an environment where you don't have as many opportunities for disruption,\" Bridenstine said. That supply chain threat is also a focus of the Pentagon's work in space. \"I think the Space Force is very interested in making sure that that we do have consistent supply chains that are not at risk, and we don't have to be spending money with countries that aren't friendly with us,\" Bridenstine added. Phase Four has contracts to develop and produce thrusters from the Air Force and DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, as well as commercial orders from companies like Capella Space. The company has 32 employees and is expanding into a 23,000-square-foot facility in Hawthorne, California. It plans to raise another funding round in 2023 and to grow to about 50 people over the next 12 months. CEO Beau Jarvis told CNBC that his relationship with Bridenstine dates back to when Jarvis was a vice president at satellite imagery company Planet and the latter was a congressman. At the time, Bridenstine was \"trying to make it easier for small space companies to be able to work with the Department of Defense, or more broadly, the U.S. government,\" Jarvis said. \"Seeing some of what Jim has talked about more recently, in terms of having more sustainable space operations, and the potential for debris issues in space ... there's a lot of overlap [between] Jim's vision and our vision,\" Jarvis said."},

The Swedish payments firm generated revenues of 9.1 billion Swedish krona ($950 million) in the period spanning January to the end of June 2022. That was up 24% from a year ago. But the company also racked up hefty losses. Klarna's pre-tax loss soared more than threefold year-on-year to nearly 6.2 billion krona. In the first half of 2021, Klarna lost around 1.8 billion Swedish krona. The company, which allows users to spread the cost of purchases over interest-free installments, saw a jump in operating expenses and defaults. Operating expenses before credit losses came in at 10.8 billion Swedish krona, up from 6.3 billion krona year-over-year, driven by administrative costs related to its rapid international expansion in countries like the U.S. Credit losses, meanwhile, rose more than 50% to 2.9 billion Swedish krona. Klarna had previously been profitable for most of its existence \u2014 that is up until 2019, when the firm dipped into the red for the first time after a hike in investments aimed at growing the business globally. The company's ballooning losses highlight the price of its rapid expansion after the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. Klarna has entered 11 new markets since the start of 2020, and took a number of costly gambits to extend its foothold in the U.S. and Britain. In the U.S., Klarna has spent heavily on marketing and user acquisition in an effort to chip away at Affirm, its main rival stateside. In the U.K., meanwhile, the firm acquired PriceRunner, a price comparison site, in April. It has also engaged in a charm offensive with British politicians and regulators ahead of incoming regulations. More recently, Klarna has been forced to cut back. In May, the company slashed about 10% of its global workforce in a swift round of job cuts. The company subsequently raised raised funds at a $6.7 billion valuation \u2014 an 85% drop from its previous valuation \u2014 in an $800 million investment deal that defined the capitulation from high-growth tech firms as investors grew wary of a possible recession. The sharp discount reflected grim sentiment among investors in fintech in both the public and private markets, with publicly-listed fintech Affirm having lost about three quarters of its market value since the start of 2022. \"We've had to make some tough decisions, ensuring we have the right people, in the right place, focused on business priorities that will accelerate us back to profitability while supporting consumers and retailers through a more difficult economic period,\" said Sebastian Siemiatkowski, CEO and co-founder of Klarna. \"We needed to take immediate and pre-emptive action, which I think was misunderstood at the time, but now sadly we have seen many other companies follow suit.\" Klarna said it plans to tighten its approach to lending, particularly with new customers, to factor in the worsening cost-of-living situation. However, Siemiatkowski said, \"You won't see the impact of this on our financials in this report yet.\" \"We have a very agile balance sheet, especially in comparison to traditional banks due to the short-term nature of our products, but even for Klarna it takes a little while for the impact of decisions to flow through.\" Fintech companies are cutting expenses and delaying listing plans amid a worsening macroeconomic backdrop. Meanwhile, consumer-oriented services are losing their appeal among investors while so-called \"business-to-business\" fintechs attract the limelight. Klarna says it is now used by over 150 million people, while the company counts 450,000 merchants on its network. Klarna mainly generates income from retailers, not users, taking a small slice of each transaction processed through its platform. \"Ultimately they've proven there can be a profitable business there but have doubled down on growing in the U.S. market which is expensive,\" Simon Taylor, head of strategy at fintech startup Sardine.ai, told CNBC. \"Market share there will be meaningful for long-term revenue. But it takes time and the funding taps aren't what they used to be.\" But the company faces stiff competition, with titans in the realms of both tech and finance seeking to capitalize on growth in the buy now, pay later industry. Apple is set to launch its own BNPL product, Apple Pay Later, this fall, which will allow users to split the cost of their purchases over four equal monthly payments. Meanwhile, proposals are afoot to bring the BNPL market under regulatory supervision. In the U.K., the government has announced plans to enforce tighter affordability checks and a crackdown on misleading advertisements. Stateside, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau opened a market-monitoring probe into BNPL companies."},

Speaking to CNBC's \" Street Signs Asia\" on Wednesday, Sanjay Kapoor, who is now an independent analyst, said Indian mobile operator Reliance Jio's $25 billion plan to launch 5G network across the country indicates that India is \"very serious\" about 5G. 5G refers to the fifth generation of high-speed mobile internet which offers super-fast download speeds and more bandwidth that's capable of supporting technologies like driverless cars and virtual reality applications, including the metaverse. According to Reuters, Reliance is making a push to roll out its network within two months. It is also developing an affordable 5G smartphone with Google, according to the report. \"But when you look at what's happening \u2026 [in] China, for example, a single operator puts in more than $15 [billion], $16 billion every year, and they've been doing it for the last couple of years,\" said Kapoor. \"From an international perspective, [$25 billion] seems pretty okay. But in India, it looks really colossal.\" In July, India kicked off its 5G auction ahead of a planned 2023 rollout. Bidders include three of the country's major mobile operators in India \u2014 Reliance Jio, the market leader, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea \u2014 as well as Indian billionaire Gautam Adani's Adani Enterprises. Kapoor said the battle for the 72 gigahertz of 5G spectrum will be a \"two-horse race\" between Reliance and Bharti Airtel. \"They will be neck-to-neck [and] the strategies might differ,\" he added. Reliance Industries' Jio deposited 140 billion rupees of earnest money with the Indian government in July \u2014 it was the largest sum among the contenders. The amount of earnest money deposited is an indication of the amount of spectrum a company wishes to buy. Bharti Airtel deposited 55 billion rupees, while Vodafone Idea put in an earnest money deposit of 22 billion rupees. Reliance may have had a first-mover's advantage with its recent announcement, but Bharti Airtel's postpaid customer base could give it an edge over its rival, Kapoor said. However, what customers really value is their experience with a service provider, he pointed out. \"Therefore, each one of them will have to strive for supremacy in the market to make sure that they have a positive customer experience and are able to be competitive and world-class.\" But India's 5G infrastructure still has some way to go before that can happen, according to Kapoor. \"To give a sizable rollout in a country as large as India, it's not going to be very easy,\" he said. \"Do we have completely fiberized sites? China, for example, has a million sites already \u2026 and we [have] roughly, to each operator, about 250,000 sites.\" He added that India is going to need \"a lot more\" fiberized sites before it can give coverage to every nook and corner. Fibre infrastructure is the backbone of ultra-fast 5G networks, where a large availability of fiber-optic cables are required. \"To the time when we really can boast about giving a great customer experience, I think we are two, three years away,\" Kapoor said."},

The agency claims Kochava violated a section of the FTC Act that prohibits unfair deceptive practices in commerce. Using data Kochava collected on mobile devices and combining it with public map programs, the FTC found it was possible to infer the identity of the device owner by linking those devices to sensitive locations and tracing them back to single-family homes. The agency claimed that until at least June of this year, Kochava would grant users access to a sample data set of time-stamped location information from 61 million unique mobile devices, with relatively little effort required by the user seeking access to the data. The FTC claims Kochava was aware of this potential use, marketing its services on the Amazon Web Services Marketplace with the suggestion of using its information \"to map individual devices to households.\" The agency argues in its complaint filed in federal court in Idaho that identification via Kochava's location data \"is likely to injure consumers through exposure to stigma, discrimination, physical violence, emotional distress, and other harms.\" It added that Kochava could have installed reasonable safeguards to protect consumer information, like by blacklisting information associated with sensitive locations so that it would not appear in data sets, such as addiction recovery centers, shelters or medical facilities. \"This lawsuit shows the unfortunate reality that the FTC has a fundamental misunderstanding of Kochava's data marketplace business and other data businesses,\" Kochava Collective General Manager Brian Cox said in a statement. \"Kochava operates consistently and proactively in compliance with all rules and laws, including those specific to privacy.\" Cox said the company announced a new ability to block location data from sensitive locations prior to the FTC's lawsuit. He said the company engaged with the FTC for weeks explaining the data collection process and hoped to come up with \"effective solutions\" with the agency. \"Unfortunately the only outcome the FTC desired was a settlement that had no clear terms or resolutions and redefined the problem into a moving target,\" Cox said. \"Real progress to improve data privacy for consumers will not be reached through flamboyant press releases and frivolous litigation. It's disappointing that the agency continues to circumvent the lawmaking process and perpetuate misinformation surrounding data privacy.\" The FTC voted 4-1 to bring the lawsuit, with Republican Commissioner Noah Joshua Phillips voting against filing the complaint. The commission's other Republican, Christine Wilson, voted with the Democratic majority. The lawsuit builds on the agency's focus on privacy, after announcing earlier this month it is exploring new rules to crack down on commercial surveillance and lax data security.

One of the enduring lessons of the iPhone era is that Steve Jobs led with what the consumer didn't know they wanted until he showed it to them. Robotics pioneer Rodney Brooks has operated from a similar idea \u2014 with varying degrees of success. His robot vacuum cleaner Roomba, and its parent company iRobot, which more or less made the category of robotic vacuums an inexpensive, must-have for many consumers, was recently sold to Amazon for $1.7 billion. \"iRobot found a product-market fit. It had a feature set and a cost that lots and lots of people were willing to pay for, that puck-shaped thing that cleans the floor pretty well,\" said Matt Beane, an assistant professor in the technology management program at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and a robotics expert. But another of Brooks' big, early ideas, hasn't worked out the way he or the world imagined. Rethink Robotics was founded in 2008 with the idea that a cobot \u2014 a robot working alongside humans in ways that traditional automation couldn't (i.e. with much less danger to the human), and without the fencing that most industrial robots remained inside \u2014 was a market waiting to be made among industrial customers. But for all the novel ideas that Brooks and his Rethink colleagues brought to the table, its first cobot never caught on. It caught on in the press, for sure, and if you were following tech news at the beginning of the last decade you likely saw Baxter and \"his eyes\" staring out from the screen between his arms at some point in a photo or video footage. At CNBC, we learned firsthand the limitations of working with novel industrial robots when we invited Baxter on-air for a live segment as part of Rethink being named to the inaugural Disruptor 50 list in 2013. For technical reasons, it would have been a lot more difficult than we imagined to get Baxter onto the television studio set. While he may not be a part of the robotic future anymore, there is no history of the cobot that can be written without Baxter. \"There is no such thing as the cobot without Rod Brooks,\" Beane said. \"Rethink started the industry.\" After a lot of early fanfare, reality set in for Rethink. By 2018, it was struggling to scale its operations and find enough buyers for Baxter, with its two-armed design proving to be a novel idea, but a mistake. \"No one needs a two-armed robot,\" Beane said, describing that design decision as \"humans projecting onto a robot their own physical form.\" Rethink pivoted, in what turned out to be a move made too late, to a one-armed robot named Sawyer. But the technology had other problems. Rethink bet on an approach that used elastic actuators \u2014 a technology one of Brooks co-founders was an expert on \u2014 which allowed the robot to perform \"force sensing,\" an approach the company backed because it would make the robots safer around human coworkers. Rethink's design would also make the robots low cost, getting rid of standard industry reliance on motors and related parts. Paul Maeder, a mechanical engineer who invested early in Rethink through his VC firm, told the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in a post-mortem on Rethink that goes deep into the technical shortcomings, that cheaper parts plus force sensing seemed like the way to bring down pricing in the robotics market and appeal to customers. And it did bring down pricing. \"The reality is that they had a very low price point, shockingly low,\" Beane said. \"They had done an amazingly good job at materials sourcing and design, and they were headed to one-third or one-quarter of the price for other robots.\" But Rethink never achieved the market penetration or scale it needed to maintain its operations. As the financials worsened, Rethink became the acquisition target of a Chinese firm, a deal Beane says would have had a good shot at getting the firm to scale. But that deal was scuttled \"at the last moment,\" according to the company, and a 2018 bankruptcy followed. Rethink was bought out of bankruptcy by German automation company Hahn Group, which is still trying to make the technology a success today. In a statement provided to TechCrunch at the time of its demise, Rethink said, \"We were early to market with a very innovative product that was ahead of its time, and unfortunately, we did not achieve the commercial success we had expected.\" It's true Rethink had no shortage of interesting, innovative ideas, even if they weren't the right ones for the market. According to Beane, one of the most intriguing was the ability for the cobot to be programmed by the worker. \"People don't make much of this feature anymore, but that was a graphic user interface system which didn't require code and you could teach it, train it to do a job as the worker,\" Beane said. \"But no manager would turn those features on,\" he added. That's an idea that Brooks is still working on today, through his latest robotics startup Robust.ai, co-founded with cognitive scientist Gary Marcus, which is making a warehouse cobot, Carter, that is like a mobile shopping cart providing transport within fulfillment centers. \"It can drive in any direction and is worker programmable and can physically collaborate,\" Beane said. \"A lot of the same DNA is there.\" Once Sawyer became the lead cobot, Rethink invested in a technology that integrated the cobot with preexisting industrial automation, an interesting approach, but ultimately, another bottleneck that was costly in engineering time to connect and to get to communicate with machinery like conveyors. \"Just to alter the speed of a conveyor is extremely expensive,\" Beane said. The DNA that has become standard in the cobot market that Baxter, and later Sawyer, hoped to dominate, is from Rethink rival and Denmark-based Universal Robots. While its cobots may be \"very boring looking\" in Beane's view, they were what the market ultimately wanted. \"In the end, the series elastic actuators were probably not the best idea in the world,\" Maeder told ASME. \"What customers really want is a low-cost, simple, fast, repeatable robot. They want to put something in this exact location again, and again and again. In the end, that was a lot more complicated for us to achieve than for some of our competitors because they weren't trying to do force sensing.\" Even the two arms that Baxter had could always be purchased by a buyer if they really wanted that approach, by purchasing two single-arm robots, and that's what Universal Robots \u2014 which was acquired by industrial automation company Teradyne in 2015 \u2014 excels at, with its UR3, UR5 and UR7 cobots leading to increased sales, and successive generations of its cobot line continuing to hit the market. The opportunity for robotics technology remains significant, though it is still trailing other automation approaches in market penetration. Robot sales in the North American market have been growing, and the Teradyne unit led by Universal Robots is seeing steady, if not explosive, sales growth, too. Revenue was $300 million in 2019, and then increased to $376 million last year after a Covid dip. According to Wall Street estimates, sales could reach $440 million this year, or about 18% growth. That growth rate is higher than the percentage of overall revenue it represents, which is still under 15%. \"A lot more will occur,\" Beane said. \"Progress often looks slow up close ... but the utility of a robotic system that can accomplish general tasks at a reasonable cost is extraordinary, billions, maybe trillions worth of value,\" he added. And costs keep going down, from batteries to sensors and software, meaning the price performance for robots keeps going up steadily. But where the cobot finds its greatest utility remains an open question. While the industrial world use has been in the first decades often as much a marketing ploy or, at best, an experiment rather than proof of widespread adoption, there is reason to forecast multiple roles for cobots based on an aging demographic. \"Anyone who says not in my lifetime, you better hope it is in your lifetime, because you will need help,\" Beane said. He anticipates that jobs outside of the manufacturing sector with which cobots have been associated \u2014 from warehousing to retail, medical (think cobots bringing supplies to nurses) and retirement communities \u2014 are areas poised for growing use. \"Manufacturing is about high throughput and high consistency and you can automate the heck out of it without a cobot,\" Beane said. \"We're only just getting started on this capability being useful and used at scale.\" Rodney Brooks is among the robotics experts who has spoken about a world that is getting older and a working population that is not as strong. He wrote in a blog post covering his annual predictions that \"soon the houses of the elderly will be cluttered with too many robots.\" Wall Street analysts are focused on the opportunity presented by a chronic labor shortage, and related changes taking place in a global outsourcing paradigm which economies including the U.S. have been relying on for decades. With \"near shoring\" and onshoring of more manufacturing activity, there is increasing demand for labor in a tight labor market. One answer is automation, and technology like Universal Robots is relatively easy to program and implement. But one big issue the cobots have not yet solved is the same one that started Brooks down the Rethink path: figuring out what everyone wants from this technology, the \"killer app,\" so to speak, for the cobot. Universal Robots has many different applications for its technology, but not a single one that drives strong demand within one very high volume market. That's a solvable problem, but still a work in progress. Robots running popcorn stations in a movie theatre or robot cafe baristas aren't the career opportunity that takes the cobots to center stage in the economy. But there is a shortage of people and automation has to be one of the solutions, even if it doesn't happen by tomorrow. We have not reached a world of genuine physical collaboration between human worker and cobot, Beane says, \"the kind of stuff where humans reach over to grab the next thing and the robot sees I am reaching and hands it to me and we might even brush up against each other,\" but, \"We are getting there,\" he added. The automated systems that are most widely deployed remain the ones that are more dangerous and kept at a distance. But Beane thinks that Rethink came closer to solving the problem than it is given credit for, and has yet to prove in its new life under Hahn. Hahn did not respond to a request for comment by press time. \"Another eight months and maybe they might have gotten product-market fit. It was inexpensive and reliable. I really do believe we could have seen an iPhone moment,\" Beane said. In his personal blog, Brooks summed up the Rethink story this way: \"Baxter and Sawyer were the first safe robots that did not require a cage to keep humans away from them for the humans' protection. And Sawyer was the first modern industrial robot which finally got away from having a computer-like language to control it, as all robots had since the idea was first developed at the Stanford AI Lab back in the very early seventies. There is still a lot remaining to be done.\""},

The lawsuit also names MicroStrategy as a defendant. Racine alleges the company conspired to help Saylor evade the taxes. The AG's office said it's seeking to recover a total sum of over $100 million in unpaid taxes and penalties. Shares of MicroStrategy were down more than 6% Wednesday afternoon on the news. Saylor, who oversaw the company's push into bitcoin, stepped down as CEO earlier this month. Under his leadership, MicroStrategy spent close to $4 billion acquiring bitcoin at an average price of $30,700, and he has said he considers the company's stock a sort of bitcoin ETF. Saylor allegedly claimed to reside in Virginia or Florida, which have lower or no personal income tax rates, while actually living in several different homes around D.C., including a penthouse apartment in the Georgetown neighborhood or on his yacht on the Georgetown waterfront or Potomac River when the apartment was undergoing renovations, according to the lawsuit. The suit includes several screenshots of posts that appear to be from Saylor's Facebook page dating back several years and referencing the view from his \"Georgetown balcony\" and discussing his \"home\" while tagging Washington, D.C. MicroStrategy allegedly \"had detailed information confirming that Saylor was in fact a DC resident,\" according to a press release, but it chose to withhold that information. In a statement, MicroStrategy said, \"The case is a personal tax matter involving Mr. Saylor. The Company was not responsible for his day-to-day affairs and did not oversee his individual tax responsibilities. Nor did the Company conspire with Mr. Saylor in the discharge of his personal tax responsibilities. The District of Columbia's claims against the Company are false and we will defend aggressively against this overreach.\" Around 2014, the AG's office claims in the lawsuit, MicroStrategy's then-chief financial officer confronted Saylor about his alleged tax evasion being a potential liability for the company. Saylor and MicroStrategy ended up reaching an agreement where Saylor's salary would be reduced to a nominal $1, the lawsuit claims, in order to reduce the risk authorities would discover the alleged scheme. Still, the AG alleges, Saylor continued to benefit from \"fringe benefits\" with a \"high cash value,\" such as use of the company plane. \"A decade ago, I bought an historic house in Miami Beach and moved my home there from Virginia,\" Saylor said in a statement. \"Although MicroStrategy is based in Virginia, Florida is where I live, vote, and have reported for jury duty, and it is at the center of my personal and family life. I respectfully disagree with the position of the District of Columbia, and look forward to a fair resolution in the courts.\" The suit is the first to be brought under a recently passed law called the False Claims Act, according to Racine's office. The district law incentivizes whistleblowers to report tax fraud and allows the court to impose penalties up to three times the amount of the evaded taxes, according to the AG's office. The district suit follows a separate complaint filed by whistleblowers against Saylor in April 2021, accusing him of failing to pay income taxes from 2014 through 2020. The complaint was filed under seal but made public on Wednesday. The AG's office said it independently investigated the whistleblower case and found MicroStrategy had filed inaccurate W-2s with his Florida-based address and had failed to withhold taxes allegedly owed to the district. The new lawsuit alleges Saylor failed to pay income tax he owed to the district starting in 2005. \u2014 MacKenzie Sigalos contributed to this story.

CEO Evan Spiegel announced the moves in a memo Tuesday, and told employees the company needs to restructure its business to deal with its financial challenges. He said the company's current year-over-year revenue growth rate for the quarter of 8% \"is well below what we were expecting earlier this year.\" \"While we have built substantial capital reserves, and have made extensive efforts to avoid reductions in the size of our team by reducing spend in other areas, we must now face the consequences of our lower revenue growth and adapt to the market environment,\" Spiegel said. \"We are restructuring our business to increase focus on our three strategic priorities: community growth, revenue growth, and augmented reality.\" Other projects the company nuked include its Snap Minis third-party apps and Snap Games. Spiegel said Snap is also starting the \"process of winding down\" its Zenly map product and Voisey music feature, which were both inherited through acquisitions. Snap has also promoted Jerry Hunter from senior vice president of engineering to chief operating officer. Hunter will continue leading Snap's engineering unit, Spiegel said. The company said it hired Ronan Harris, Google's vice president and managing director of U.K. and Ireland, to be its president of the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, a new position. Harris will join Snap's executive team. Spiegel said Snap is currently searching for presidents of the company's Asia-Pacific and Americas regions, also two new roles. \"Changes of this magnitude are never easy, and we must act decisively to meet this moment as a team,\" Spiegel said. \"I am proud of the strength and resilience of our team as we have navigated the myriad challenges of growing our business in a highly competitive industry during uncertain and unprecedented times.\" In July, Snap shares cratered more than 25% after the company reported second-quarter results that missed on both the top and bottom lines and said it would not provide guidance for its current quarter. The company said at the time that it planned to \"substantially\" slow its hiring rate and operating expense growth rate. Like other social media companies, including Facebook parent Meta, Pinterest and Twitter, Snap said a confluence of factors has simultaneously hurt the company's business. They include a weakening macroeconomic environment and Apple 's 2021 iOS update, which made it more difficult for social media companies to track users on behalf of third-party advertisers. The rise of TikTok's short-video service has also posed a significant challenge for Snap and its competitors. Snap said it was scrapping development of its Pixy drone after reports surfaced that the company was pausing its work on the device. The drone was supposed to be a fun way for users to take photos of themselves from multiple angles. Snap has been trying to build a consumer hardware business and announced the $230 drone in April."},

Thursday's announcement follows the largest climate funding package in U.S. history, which President Joe Biden signed into law in August. The package includes incentives to jump-start domestic supply chains for electric vehicle batteries, although Piedmont said plans for the plant were in development prior to the Inflation Reduction Act. Now that the company has selected the site in McMinn County, it will begin the process of securing the necessary permits, which can be lengthy. Still, the company is targeting construction beginning in 2023, with production starting in 2025. When fully operational, the plant will produce 30,000 metric tons of lithium per year, making it the largest lithium refining facility in the U.S, according to the company. Piedmont said it will churn out enough material to supply roughly 500,000 electric vehicles annually. Piedmont currently has no active mines in the U.S., so once the facility is up and running it will process spodumene concentrate from Piedmont's international operations in Quebec and Ghana. Eventually, the company hopes to use lithium that's mined domestically. The company has plans for a mine as well as another plant in North Carolina, although CEO Keith Phillips said it's challenging from a permitting perspective, since both the mine and the plant are on the same site. Albemarle runs the only meaningful lithium mine in the U.S., which is in Silver Peak, Nevada. Additionally, only 2.1% of lithium is refined in the U.S., according to data from Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. China dominates the industry, refining more than half of global lithium supply. Should Piedmont's North Carolina mine and plant secure the required permits, however, the company forecasts its lithium output doubling, with the company supplying 1 million electric vehicles per year. Piedmont Lithium's announcement also comes as automakers are rushing toward vast electric vehicle fleets. By some forecasts, there simply won't be enough lithium to meet demand in the foreseeable future. The International Energy Agency estimates that in order to meet the goals set forth in the Paris Agreement, lithium demand will grow by over 40 times by 2040. Building new mines takes years. They're capital intensive and can face permitting challenges. There are also those opposed to new mines, who argue that the world should instead focus on existing production. Piedmont's Phillips noted that in just the last year $33 billion has been announced for electric vehicle battery manufacturing plants in the U.S., which would require 500,000 metric tons of lithium annually. \"That is more than all the lithium hydroxide produced in the world currently, so clearly the industry is facing a critical resource shortage,\" he told CNBC. \"Anyone who can produce material to supply this market \u2014 especially domestically in the United States \u2014 will be in a favored position.\" Piedmont plans to invest around $600 million developing the Tennessee facility."},

The e-commerce platform is warning merchants who try to install Amazon's \"Buy With Prime\" button on their storefront that it violates Shopify's terms of service, and is also raising the specter of security risks, according to research firm Marketplace Pulse. Amazon introduced Buy With Prime in April, pitching it as a way for merchants to grow traffic on their own websites. The service lets merchants add the Prime logo and offer Amazon's speedy delivery options on their sites. Members of the retail giant's Prime loyalty club can check out using their Amazon account. Shopify will not protect merchants who try to use Buy With Prime against fraudulent orders, according to a screenshot of a notice Shopify sent to merchants. The notice also warns that Amazon's service could steal customer data, and charge customers incorrectly. Shopify's terms of service require merchants to use Shopify Checkout \"for any sales associated with your online store.\" Merchants can use checkout integrations that are part of Shopify's payments platform. In order to be part of the payments platform, providers have to agree to Shopify's Partnership Program Agreement and API terms. Buy With Prime competes directly with Shopify's instant checkout and payment service, Shop Pay. Shopify has sought to expand the feature beyond its own platform, striking deals with Facebook and Google last year to let customers use the system to make purchases. Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke welcomed the launch of Buy With Prime at the time of Amazon's announcement, saying the company was \"happy\" to integrate the feature into its platform. \"This fits perfectly into our world view,\" Lutke told investors on the company's first-quarter earnings call. \"And it's not nearly as zero-sum as some people make it out to be.\" Privately, Shopify may not have been as pleased about Buy With Prime. The Information reported in May that the launch sparked internal debate about whether Shopify should integrate the feature on its site. Additionally, a Shopify spokesperson told the publication that Lutke's comments only represented his opinion, adding that the company needed to gather more details before ruling on the issue. A Shopify spokesperson told CNBC in a statement: \"Shopify believes it's a good thing when a company like Amazon opens their infrastructure to more independent businesses to succeed in commerce.\" Shopify has become a popular alternative for sellers who are looking to sell products online, or diversify beyond Amazon. The Canadian company got its start providing businesses with software to help them build a presence online. Shopify in May acquired third-party fulfillment service Deliverr, putting it more directly in competition with Amazon's logistics arm. In response to Shopify's claims that Buy With Prime is insecure, an Amazon spokesperson said: \"We protect information collected via Buy with Prime, including shopper data, in accordance with Amazon's high security standards. We use this information to provide and improve Buy with Prime for merchants and shoppers.\" \"We use Amazon Pay to process payments for Buy with Prime orders. Amazon Pay is backed by the fraud protection technology used on Amazon.com,\" they added. \"Merchants have complete control over the prices customers are charged.\" Shopify said its terms of service are intended to protect merchants, and violations may trigger a warning.

Now, the cryptocurrency trading platform is going after Melbourne-based Thevamanogari Manivel and her sister, Thilagavathy Gangadory, to retrieve its money \u2014 along with 10% interest and legal fees. Court documents show that in May 2021 an employee for the Singapore-based trading platform mistakenly entered an account number into the payment amount field. Crypto.com realized it had accidentally sent Manivel millions of dollars in December 2021 when it was conducting a routine audit. Manivel spent about AU$1.35 million of the accidental windfall on a property, according to the filing. While cryptocurrency transactions are not reversible, centralized platforms can theoretically reverse payments in cases of fraud or error. But in this instance, the company did not discover the error until seven months later, after some of the money had allegedly been moved or spent. The company convinced authorities to freeze Manivel's bank account in February, but she had already transferred the money to other defendants named in the case, according to the filing. The judge ruled in Crypto.com's favor, and the case returns to court in October where a judge will determine next steps in the case. The suit comes at a difficult time for the platform. In June, the company laid off 260 employees, or 5% of its workforce, and has reportedly gone through a second round of aggressive cuts, as crypto firms across the board look for ways to cut costs with investors rotating out of the riskiest assets, pulling down trading volumes.

In April, more than 2,600 workers at Amazon's warehouse in Staten Island, known as JFK8, voted to join the Amazon Labor Union, becoming the first group to vote in favor of unionizing at one of the e-commerce giant's U.S. facilities. Amazon in May sought to overturn the results of the election. It submitted a filing to the NLRB accusing the federal agency's Brooklyn office of violating labor law by appearing to support the union drive. Amazon, which included 25 objections in its filing, also alleged that labor organizers intimidated workers to vote in their favor. Amazon's objections kicked off 24 days of hearings held via Zoom where lawyers for the company, NLRB's Region 29 office, and the ALU dissected conduct during the election. JFK8 workers and union organizers, including Chris Smalls, co-founder and interim president of the ALU, were among the more than a dozen witnesses called to testify. Lisa Dunn, the NLRB attorney presiding over the hearing, concluded in a filing Thursday that Amazon \"had not met its burden\" of establishing the agency, the union or any other parties \"engaged in objectionable conduct affecting the results of the election,\" NLRB spokesperson Kayla Blado said. Dunn also recommended ALU be certified as bargaining representative, Blado said. Amazon has until Sept. 16 to file objections to Dunn's recommendations, which will then be heard by a regional director of the NLRB. The regional director will determine whether to order a new union election, or certify the results of the April election, at which point Amazon will be required to start contract negotiations with the ALU. The union said in a statement that it's pleased with the hearing officer's recommendations. \"It is our hope that the Regional Director for Region 28 can expedite our certification and that the NLRB enforces Amazon's legal obligation to negotiate with the workers of the ALU,\" the union said in a release posted to Twitter.

The lawsuit, filed on Wednesday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, comes at a critical time for Arm as its owner Softbank hopes to soon list the firm on public markets after a deal to sell it to Nvidia fell through because of regulatory scrutiny. But the suit also threatens Qualcomm's expansion plans, as it was hoping to use Nuvia processor designs at the heart of the dispute to compete more directly with Apple's chips for iPhones and Macs, and possibly use them to crack the server chip market, a lucrative space dominated by Intel and AMD. Nuvia was founded by ex-Apple chip designers and Qualcomm spent $1.4 billion to acquire it in 2021. Qualcomm's current Snapdragon chips for smartphones are also based on Arm technology. Arm is seeking damages and to force Qualcomm to destroy information and hardware from the Nuvia acquisition including chips, dies, packaging and promotional materials. The dispute centers around the rights to develop a chip using Arm's instruction set architecture (ISA), a core piece of intellectual property with origins dating back to 1985 that outlines how a chip performs basic functions like accessing memory or basic arithmetic. Arm-based chips have been ascendant in recent years because they're more power-efficient than the x86-based chips made by Intel and AMD. Over 29 billion chips based on Arm technology were shipped in 2021, including the chips at the heart of Apple's iPhones, Macs and iPads. Some companies, like Apple, license the ISA from Arm, then design their own physical processor circuits to implement the ISA instructions. Other companies, like Qualcomm historically, also buy the rights to full core designs from Arm, marketed as Cortex. Arm reported $2.7 billion in sales from licensing and royalties in 2021. The suit highlights the tension between Arm's business licensing the underlying intellectual property to make processors that could compete with the company's own designs. Arm said last year that it considered Qualcomm to be a competitor and that architectural licenses pose a threat to its implementation business. Lawsuits over intellectual property and contracts in the semiconductor industry are common. But the Arm-Qualcomm lawsuit is a significant conflict over the ability to design the kind of chip at the heart of nearly every smartphone in the world. It could have significant ramifications for chip startups and could open up a path to adoption for open-source alternatives to Arm. Qualcomm general counsel Ann Chaplin said in a statement that the dispute was a departure from a \"longstanding, successful relationship.\" \"Arm has no right, contractual or otherwise, to attempt to interfere with Qualcomm's or NUVIA's innovations,\" Chaplin said. \"Arm's complaint ignores the fact that Qualcomm has broad, well-established license rights covering its custom-designed CPUs, and we are confident those rights will be affirmed.\" Meanwhile, Arm said in a statement that the company was \"left with no choice other than to bring this claim against Qualcomm and Nuvia to protect our IP, our business, and to ensure customers are able to access valid Arm-based products.\" Qualcomm bought Nuvia because it wanted its chips to have better performance than what it could do with an off-the-shelf Arm processor design, especially to compete with Apple's high-efficiency custom Arm cores. Nuvia, a startup founded by former Apple and Google engineers, was developing a server chip with custom cores under an architecture license. It also had access to Arm's core designs. After the acquisition, Qualcomm placed Nuvia at the heart of its smartphone and PC strategy, using the startup's cores to make its laptop processors more competitive with Apple's M-series chips in products launching as soon as 2023. Qualcomm was also pitching Nuvia-based cloud processors to cloud providers such as Amazon, according to Bloomberg News. Arm says in its lawsuit that Nuvia's architectural license didn't transfer to Qualcomm when it bought it. Qualcomm has an architectural license, Arm says, but needed Arm's consent to purchase and use Nuvia's custom core designs. Arm terminated its Nuvia licenses in March, it said. If that holds in court, Qualcomm's entire chip strategy could be in flux. There may be an alternative route, however. Karl Freund, founder and analyst at Cambrian AI Research, speculated that Qualcomm could try to use RISC-V, an open source alternative to Arm's instruction set. Arm told regulators in December that \"RISC-V's momentum is accelerating\" and that established vendors are increasingly using it instead of Arm's instruction set. A few startups are currently building CPU cores based on RISC-V, but it has yet to be used in high-volume smartphones, which all currently use Arm. Arm's efforts to enforce its intellectual property with long-term partners, however, will likely prompt companies building custom Arm cores to take another look at open-source alternatives."},

The new U.S. rules are designed to reduce the risk of supporting the Chinese military, according to the U.S. government, Nvidia said in its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday. But it's unclear what prompted this specific policy move or what could drive future ones. In another positive sign for the chipmaker, the U.S. will allow Nvidia to continue developing its H100 artificial intelligence chip in China, the company said Thursday. \"The U.S. government has authorized exports, reexports, and in-country transfers needed to continue NVIDIA Corporation's, or the Company's, development of H100 integrated circuits,\" Nvidia said in a filing Thursday. The company said second-quarter revenue for its automotive business was $220 million, up 45% from a year earlier. \"Our automotive revenue is inflecting, and we expect it to be our next billion-dollar business,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in an earnings call in late August, according to a StreetAccount transcript. WeRide, an autonomous driving technology start-up, said in a statement that \"there is no immediate impact from the ban.\" \"We believe both the supply and demand side in the industry will work closely together to handle the constantly changing business environment to safeguard the continuous development of technology,\" the company said in a statement to CNBC. Pony.ai, another autonomous driving start-up, said it is not affected, as did automaker Geely. \u2014 CNBC's Kif Leswing contributed to this report."},

The website called Temu, which went online Thursday, lists items across a number of categories including clothing, jewelry, pet supplies and home and garden, and could mark a new challenge to U.S. e-commerce leader Amazon. Pinduoduo did not respond to a request for comment when contacted by CNBC. Temu marks Pinduoduo's biggest push overseas yet as the domestic Chinese economy faces a number of challenges from a resurgence of Covid-19 to an energy crunch. That has hurt economic growth in China and dampened consumer sentiment. China's biggest technology companies from Tencent to Pinduoduo's e-commerce rivals Alibaba and JD.com continue to pursue international markets. Pinduoduo, a much younger company than Alibaba and JD.com, having only been founded in 2015, is behind its rivals when it comes to the overseas push. Alibaba took a controlling stake in Singapore-based Southeast Asian e-commerce site Lazada in 2016 and has since invested money in the business to expand its presence in the region. Alibaba also has a separate website called AliExpress that services markets like Europe and the U.S. JD.com meanwhile operates Joybuy.com for international customers. Pinduoduo's Temu is a cross-border e-commerce website with most products likely to come from overseas, especially China. Temu said shipping to the U.S. could take 7-15 business days. \"It's important to keep in mind that you may see longer delivery times than you're used to from other e-commerce websites. This is due to the fact that items that may be coming from another country or need to be bundled or packaged with other similar-sized items,\" the website says on the shipping information page. Shipping is free for orders over $49. Pinduoduo could face some challenges in cracking the U.S. market. First it will need to build brand reputation versus the likes of Amazon. And it could also suffer from its relatively long shipping times versus the same-day or next-day deliveries Amazon offers via its Prime subscription services. Temu's \"main challenges will be cultivating trust and awareness among customers,\" Jacob Cooke, CEO of WPIC, an e-commerce tech and marketing firm that helps foreign brands sell in China, told CNBC. There are currently also some categories that have very few products. For example, the men's wristwatch category had just two products listed. However, Temu could compete on price. On Thursday, Temu had a 20% discount offer sitewide. And products appear to be quite cheap. For example, the women's dresses listed were mostly under $20. Temu could also have an advantage due to \"existing relationships with low-cost manufacturers in China that maybe haven't expanded to the U.S. yet,\" Cooke said. Pinduoduo has grown quickly in its seven-year history to become one of China's biggest e-commerce firms. The company has tended to focus on lower-income consumers by offering heavily discounted products. And it has been focusing on bringing agricultural products onto its platform to differentiate from rivals. The company is worth around $87 billion."},

Some 220 solar panels and other equipment at the facility, known as FAT1, were damaged by the three-alarm fire, which was caused by \"an undetermined electrical event within the solar system mounted on top of the roof,\" Leland Wilding, Fresno's fire investigator, wrote in an incident report. A little over a year later, about 60 firefighters were called to an even larger Amazon facility in Perryville, Maryland, to put out a two-alarm blaze, local news outlets reported. In the intervening months, at least four other Amazon fulfillment centers caught fire or experienced electrical explosions due to failures with their solar energy-generating systems, according to internal company documents viewed by CNBC. The documents, which have never been made public, indicate that between April 2020 and June 2021, Amazon experienced \"critical fire or arc flash events\" in at least six of its 47 North American sites with solar installations, affecting 12.7% of such facilities. Arc flashes are a kind of electrical explosion. \"The rate of dangerous incidents is unacceptable, and above industry averages,\" an Amazon employee wrote in one of the internal reports. The solar snafus underscore the challenge Amazon and many other large corporations face in their quest to shrink their environmental footprint and reduce reliance on fossil fuels. Amazon has been among the most aggressive. In 2019, founder Jeff Bezos launched the Climate Pledge, promising the largest online retailer would zero out emissions by 2040, embrace renewable energy and move away from gas-guzzling delivery vans, including through a billion-dollar-plus investment in electric vehicle company Rivian. Corporate America is under pressure from regulators and a growing subset of investors to set and report on environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals. Many will be able to reap financial rewards for renewable energy efforts after Congress in August passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which includes climate provisions projected to reduce the country's carbon emissions by roughly 40% by 2030. Commercial solar in the U.S. is expected to see 8% annual growth over the next five years, thanks in part to the legislation, according to Wood Mackenzie solar analyst Michelle Davis. Warehouses can take outsized advantage of solar, she said, because they have large roofs and the systems can power all the HVAC, refrigeration and other energy-heavy systems located inside. But costly and dangerous issues can arise. By June of last year, all of Amazon's U.S. operations with solar had to be taken offline temporarily, internal documents show. The company had to ensure its systems were designed, installed and maintained properly before \"re-energizing\" any of them. Amazon spokesperson Erika Howard told CNBC in a statement that the incidents involved systems run by partners, and that the company responded by voluntarily turning off its solar-powered roofs. \"Out of an abundance of caution, following a small number of isolated incidents with onsite solar systems owned and operated by third parties, Amazon proactively powered off our onsite solar installations in North America, and took immediate steps to re-inspect each installation by a leading solar technical expert firm,\" the statement said. Those details didn't show up in Amazon's 100-page sustainability report for 2021, which was published at the beginning of August. In that report, available to the public via Amazon's sustainability website, the company said rooftop solar was powering 115 of its fulfillment centers across the globe by the end of 2021, up from more than 90 in the middle of the year. The majority of those are outside the U.S. \"Many of our fulfillment facilities throughout the U.S., Europe, and India are powered by on-site solar, where a rooftop installation can power up to 80% of the facility's energy use,\" the report said. By April of this year, Amazon had onsite solar at 176 facilities, according to its website. The solar program was launched in 2017. \"As inspections are completed, our onsite solar systems are being powered back on,\" Howard said. \"Amazon also built a team of dedicated solar experts overseeing the construction, operations, and maintenance of our systems in-house to ensure the safety of our systems.\" Excluded from the public sustainability report is any mention of the expenses Amazon incurs when there's a failure. An Amazon employee estimated, in the documents circulated internally, that each incident cost the company an average of $2.7 million. Costs included third-party audits of rooftop solar systems, checks on how much electricity they were generating and repairs for any broken or faulty parts of the systems that inspectors identified. The Amazon employee also said the company would lose $940,000 per month, or $20,000 for each of the 47 decommissioned North American sites, as long as the solar remained offline. There could be additional costs for Amazon depending on contracts with clean energy partners for renewable energy credits, the documents show. To date, Amazon has contracted with third-party vendors to design, then install solar photovoltaic systems on rooftops and big backup batteries on site. Other major retailers, including Walmart and Target, have also installed solar rooftops and adopted programs to trim their energy bills and reach sustainability goals. In addition to its warehouses, Amazon has some solar roof systems at its Whole Foods stores. Amazon and its auditor, Clean Energy Associates (CEA), put off inspection of the solar rooftop systems at Whole Foods locations until 2022, the documents said. As of late 2021, four years after acquiring Whole Foods, Amazon was still working to attain technical information about the renewable energy assets at the stores. To maintain tighter quality control of its solar energy systems, some Amazon employees recommended bringing more operations in-house. The fire in Perryville, Maryland, which was the sixth failure in a little over a year, spurred the company to take systematic action. On June 17, 2021, roughly a week after the fire at the warehouse known as MDT2, Amazon's sustainability division directed the owners and developers of solar rooftop systems on its U.S. warehouses to decommission them. The solar rooftops would no longer be generating electricity from the sun or producing renewable energy credits. Amazon then hired Denver-based CEA to conduct a third-party audit of its rooftop solar systems in the U.S., Asia-Pacific and Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Late last year, while CEA was still conducting its inspections, it informed Amazon of one critical and 259 major findings across Amazon's rooftop solar portfolio. Problems included mismatched module-to-module connectors, improper installation of connectors, poor wire management and evidence of water intrusion in the inverters, internal documents said. Issues with inverters, which convert solar energy into usable electricity, were identified as the likely cause of a fire in at least one Amazon warehouse. Wilding, the Fresno fire inspector, concluded the blaze at FAT1 \"originated on or near two inverters,\" according to an investigation report obtained by CNBC through a request for public records. Amazon blamed third-party partners and vendors for the most significant problems uncovered by CEA and other teams working on facilities and sustainability initiatives. \"Over the past five years, solar malfunctions have been caused by improper installation techniques, improper commissioning of a new system, inadequate system maintenance and equipment malfunction,\" the documents said. Amazon teams working on facilities and sustainability initiatives devised a two-part plan to help prevent future breakdowns in the rooftop solar program. In late 2021, the divisions requested $3.6 million in funding to reinspect sites where major findings were identified in order to ensure the systems were safe to be brought back online, according to internal correspondence. Internal teams also began to urge Amazon leadership to rely more on salaried employees and less on outside vendors. Over time, the company hired more solar experts focused on procurement, design, construction and maintenance globally. In some cases, management was notably slow in responding. For example, the groups inside the company agitating for change went to leadership for approval on the hiring, re-inspection and re-energizing plans. But the efforts were held up for months by top Amazon executives, including Kara Hurst, vice president of worldwide sustainability, and Alicia Boler-Davis, senior vice president of global customer fulfillment, who left the company in June 2022, according to internal correspondence viewed by CNBC. Amazon disputed the claim in the documents that leadership was slow to address employee requests. Job openings suggest Amazon is still seeking to hire people internally for solar operations. The company was recently looking for someone to manage sustainability projects across its North American facilities, which include rooftop solar. There's a current listing for a technical program partner on the solar team says that a key aspect of the position is collaborating with \"internal partners\" in worldwide design, solar construction and sustainability, among other divisions. As it tries to staff up, Amazon has acknowledged that going green comes with hurdles, particularly for a company \"of the size and broad scope of Amazon.\" \"But at Amazon, we don't shy away from big challenges,\" Hurst wrote, in the letter kicking off the 2021 sustainability report. \"We don't have all the answers today, but we believe in the need to act now.\" WATCH: How two friends formed Amazon's first U.S. union and what's next"},

The two U.S. technology giants have signed a multi-year agreement \"to collaborate on a new era of spatial computing,\" using Qualcomm's \"extended reality\" (XR) Snapdragon technology. Extended reality refers to technologies including virtual and augmented reality, which merge the physical and digital world. \"We're working with Qualcomm Technologies on customized virtual reality chipsets \u2014 powered by Snapdragon XR platforms and technology \u2014 for our future roadmap of Quest products,\" Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, said in a press release. The Quest products are Meta's line of virtual reality headsets. The Meta Quest 2 headset currently uses Qualcomm's Snapdragon XR2 chipset. Since its rebrand in 2021, Facebook-parent Meta has staked its future on the metaverse \u2014 a term that encompasses virtual and augmented reality technology \u2014 with the aim of having people working and playing in digital worlds in the near future. In the smartphone field, companies ranging from Apple to Samsung have designed their own custom processors to differentiate from competitors and create better products than they might have using off-the-shelf chips. A focus on custom chips by Meta makes sense as it looks to differentiate its headsets and possibly create unique experiences for users. \"Unlike mobile phones, building virtual reality brings novel, multi-dimensional challenges in spatial computing, cost, and form factor,\" Zuckerberg said. \"These chipsets will help us keep pushing virtual reality to its limits and deliver awesome experiences.\" The length of the deal between the companies and financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. It comes as Meta gears up to launch a new virtual reality headset in October, even as losses widened in its Reality Labs division, which includes its VR business, in the second quarter of the year."},

On Friday, the company launched the mid-range Honor 70 smartphone in Europe and said an unannounced foldable phone will be coming to the region and other international markets too in the future. It will be the first time Honor launches a foldable device overseas, the company said. Honor faces an uphill battle outside of China where it has less than a 1% smartphone market share. The brand was sold by Huawei to a consortium of Chinese buyers in late 2020 as a way to survive U.S. sanctions. In 2019 and 2020, Huawei was hit by a number of American sanctions that cut its access to Google software and key chips, destroying its smartphone business. Since then, Honor has launched a number of smartphones. This year, it brought its flagship Magic 4 handset to international markets. Alongside the upcoming foldable phone, Honor is placing emphasis on the more expensive premium end of the smartphone market outside of China. That will put Honor in competition with Samsung's latest foldables \u2014 the Galaxy Z Flip 4 and Galaxy Z Fold 4. \"As the global economy has deteriorated in 2022, the premium end has remained strong, benefitting Samsung and Apple so far this year,\" James Manning Smith, senior analyst at CCS Insight, told CNBC via email. \"One of Honor's greatest challenges in the year will be trying to leverage this trend, attempting to win sales from well-established premium brands, particularly in a year where stretched budgets will result in consumers looking to avoid potentially more risky purchases.\" Shipments of phones costing over $1,000 grew 94% year-on-year in the second quarter, according to Counterpoint Research. This segment is dominated by Apple and Samsung. But Honor's Chinese rivals including Xiaomi, Oppo and Realme have also managed to gain share overseas by managing to pump out mid-priced devices with high specs. That will pose another challenge to Honor. Honor's \"low-cost Chinese peers have made some serious in-roads in the European market over the last two years, a position that they will not give up without a fight,\" Smith added. \"Although Honor has been ramping up its marketing, it faces some incredibly fierce competition outside of China.\""},
{"url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/29/apple-iphone-14-event-preview-september-2022.html", "title": "Expect Apple to show four new iPhones and an updated Apple Watch next week", "tag": "Tech", "author": "Kif Leswing", "datetime": "2022-08-29 18:11:43", "paragraphs": " Apple is holding a launch event at its headquarters in Cupertino, California, on Sept. 7. The company is expected to announce new iPhone models, as it has every September since 2012. Apple has used prerecorded videos for its launch events since early 2020 thanks partly to Covid restrictions, and this will be the first iPhone launch with an in-person component since 2019. Apple is streaming the launch event online on its website and YouTube in addition to inviting some media to its campus. Apple's hype-filled fall launches are a signature event for Apple. They typically draw millions of simultaneous viewers on YouTube. They garner attention from around the world and set the stage for a holiday marketing blitz during the last three months of the year, which is when Apple's sales are the highest. This year's event has the tagline \"far out,\" which could refer to features such as night-sky photography. Last year, Apple released new iPhones and Apple Watches at an event in September, and then followed it up with an October launch featuring iPads and Macs. Here's what Apple is likely to launch next Wednesday, based on reports. Apple is expected to release four new iPhone models. If Apple's current naming convention holds up, they will be called the iPhone 14. This year Apple will likely discontinue the \"mini\" model with a 4.7-inch screen, according to reports. Instead, Apple could offer two sizes, one with a 6.1-inch screen and one with a 6.7-inch screen, each coming in a standard model and a pricier \"Pro\" model. The Pro models are expected to get more upgrades, according to reports from Bloomberg News, TFI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, and other analysts and Apple watchers. Since 2017, iPhones have included a space at the top of the phone's display with space for Apple's FaceID system, which includes several sensors and a camera. The Pro models could ditch Apple's \"notch\" where it houses the FaceID camera for a slimmer, more streamlined \"pill\" or \"cutout\" approach with a smaller space that has to remain blank, leaving room for an even larger display. The Pro models are also expected to get upgraded A16 processors and cameras. The camera bump is expected to get larger. Apple could release an always-on screen display for showing notifications, like some Android phones have sported for years. Beta iPhone software released over the summer suggested that Apple may be planning a similar feature because of new widgets that show weather and battery life. One of the biggest questions is how Apple will price its iPhones in a period of inflation around the world and macroeconomic uncertainty in some regions. Other consumer electronics, such as Sony's Playstation 5, have seen price cuts. Apple's least-expensive iPhone 13 model is the $699 iPhone 13 Mini, which is expected to be discontinued. That would make Apple's mainline device, which is currently the iPhone 13, the least-expensive new model at $829, if its price doesn't change. Some analysts also expect Apple to increase the price of its Pro models. Apple usually drops the price of older models when it releases new ones, giving more price-sensitive consumers an option. Apple is likely to show the eighth major new version of its watch next week. Last year, the Apple Watch Series 7 got a slightly larger screen, but the redesign did not significantly change the look and feel of the device, which has remained mostly the same since 2014. Expect more evolution this year, too. Apple is considering a body temperature sensor in the new devices, according to the Wall Street Journal, which could help with fertility and sleep tracking. Other sleep tracking features could include the ability to detect advanced sleep patterns or apnea. But the biggest Apple Watch Series 8 announcement could be a new \"Pro\" model with a bigger screen and more durable finish. Apple has previously released Apple Watches with pricey case materials such as gold, ceramic and titanium, and the new \"Pro\" model described by Bloomberg and Kuo could be one of the first high-end Apple Watches to gain additional features over its less-expensive siblings. Also likely: A new updated version of the Apple Watch SE, its $329 entry-level Watch model. IPhone owners who don't plan to buy any new gear this fall will still get an annual update to the iPhones software, iOS 16, which was announced in June and has been in testing over the summer. The software has several new features that users will immediately notice. The biggest banner feature is the ability to customize the iPhone's lock screen with widgets that can display weather forecasts, calendar appointments and other information at a glance. Users can also change the font for the lock screen clock for the first time, as well. IOS 16 also lets you unsend or edit iMessage text messages, as long as you catch them within a few minutes of sending. IOS 16 will also introduce short-term loans from Apple called Apple Pay Later. The feature will allow users to buy stuff online with Apple Pay but pay for the item in four installments without paying interest. One cool feature in iOS 16 is if a user has both an iPhone and a Mac laptop or desktop, they can use the iPhone as a very high-definition web camera. Apple is unlikely to release new iPads next week because their software isn't ready yet. Earlier this month, Apple told TechCrunch that iPadOS, the iPad software, will ship after iOS this fall, suggesting a staggered release. Apple's statement was terse, and the company dislikes talking about unannounced products. But in general, it likes to release new hardware together with new software, so the statement clearly suggested that new iPads would come at a later launch date than iPhones. IPadOS and iOS are very similar, but this year iPadOS is getting a feature called Stage Manager that could allow users to multitask more efficiently \u2014 but also got panned by early testers. Improved iPads could include more powerful processors that are closers to laptop processors, smoother displays and better integration with accessories. Apple also uncharacteristically teased a new \"Mac Pro\" in the spring. The Mac Pro is currently a $5,000 tower of power using an Intel processor. Apple wants to transition its entire Mac lineup away from Intel to its own M-series processors, but a pricey niche product doesn't fit as well with Apple's mass-market iPhones and Apple Watches. Instead, new Macs could be announced at a separate event later this year, as happened last year."},

It's a win for the company after it warned Wednesday that new export restrictions could hamper its operations in the country. Nvidia said in an SEC filing Wednesday that the U.S. government is restricting sales of high-performance AI chips for servers, the A100 and H100, to China and Russia. Sales of both chips are still restricted in those markets, though it can still develop the H100 in China. Nvidia expects a $400 million hit to revenue in the current quarter from new export restrictions. The company's stock fell nearly 9% in trading Thursday. \"The U.S. government has authorized exports, reexports, and in-country transfers needed to continue NVIDIA Corporation's, or the Company's, development of H100 integrated circuits,\" Nvidia said in a filing Thursday. The Biden administration is working to limit U.S. exports of certain semiconductors and equipment because of fears that Chinese companies could use them for military purposes. Graphics processors like the kind that Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices make are well suited for artificial intelligence applications that could include weapons development, facial recognition and other military uses. The H100 is Nvidia's upcoming enterprise AI chip that was previously expected to ship by the end of the year. Part of its development takes place in China. The A100 is an older model that has been shipping for three years. They are both graphics processors that can be used for supercomputing and artificial intelligence. Nvidia's data center business, which includes sales of the A100 and H100, is one of the fastest-growing parts of the company, reporting $3.8 billion in sales in the June quarter, a 61% annual increase. However, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang warned analysts in August that Chinese cloud companies were slowing down building out their data centers and that China was a \"very large market\" for the company. Nvidia said Thursday that it can continue to ship AI chips from its Hong Kong facility through September 2023. \"The Chinese hyperscalers and the Chinese Internet companies really, really slowed down infrastructure investment this year, particularly starting in -- they've been rather slow in building out and really accelerate -- well, really slowed down in Q2,\" Huang said. Some analysts believe that Nvidia can ameliorate the impact of the new export restrictions by working with the government, although it's unclear whether the Chinese government might retaliate with its own bans. \"While there are potential near and intermediate term risks from the export ban, Nvidia is working closely with the [U.S. government] to navigate through the situation and we believe the USG is fully aware of the critical/strategic importance of Nvidia's accelerated compute platform to the global tech industry,\" JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur wrote in a note Thursday. The Department of Commerce said the new export restrictions are related to national security, but it didn't answer follow-up questions about whether it clarified or changed the policy for Nvidia. \"While we are not in a position to outline specific policy changes at this time, we are taking a comprehensive approach to implement additional actions necessary related to technologies, end-uses, and end-users to protect U.S. national security and foreign policy interests,\" a Department of Commerce representative said Wednesday. AMD also said Wednesday that it received new license requirements from the Department of Commerce, but did not expect them to materially affect its business because of lower China exposure. Shares of AMD fell more than 4% during trading Thursday."},

Employees are turning to gadgets to outsmart monitoring software. One such tool is a mouse mover, or mouse jiggler, that's supposed to keep your screen on. I decided to give one a try to see if it works. I learned about mouse jigglers on TikTok. A mouse mover is a device that claims to be undetectable by your computer. As the name indicates, the device simulates mouse movement, preventing your computer from going into sleep mode. So-called \"tattleware,\" or surveillance software is being installed on company-issued devices to track employee screen time, keyboard usage, and clicks. The mouse jiggler may not help with keyboard usage or clicks, but it should address screen time monitoring by keeping your computer's display on. Here's how a mouse jiggler works. I ordered a $30 Vaydeer Mouse Jiggler off Amazon and tested it out for a day. It took less than a minute to set up. You simply plug the power cord into the USB port on your computer, or attach it to the power brick and plug it into the wall. Use the wall for power if you're paranoid. You probably don't want to plug any type of device that helps you avoid work directly into a work-owned computer, especially since USB ports open up a whole host of security concerns, too. There's an orange power button on the left side that you can press to turn it on and off. A turntable moves when it's on. That's where you place the mouse's sensor. Once your mouse is in the right position, you'll begin to see the cursor on your screen move very slowly, keeping your monitor from going to sleep. That's pretty much all there is to it. Once your mouse is on the jiggler you can get up, make lunch, do whatever you need, and your computer won't go to sleep. It won't make you more productive, of course, but it may trick some surveillance software into thinking you're still working, at least if that software is checking to see if your computer is active. We shouldn't need these gadgets in the first place, though. I was surprised to learn employer surveillance is more common than I thought. A recent examination by the New York Times found that 80% of the 10 largest private U.S. employers track the productivity metrics of individual workers. And secretly monitoring employees makes them more likely to the very break rules these systems are trying to deter, according to a recent study by Harvard Business Review. Transparency is key to keeping worker morale up. Instead of monitoring employees, explaining the scope and purpose of monitoring can boost employees' acceptance of the practice by about 70%, according to a recent study by Gartner, a management consultant company."},

It also launched a line of frozen, human-grade meals for dogs. \"Pet parents are driving one of the biggest trends the pet industry has seen as they increasingly seek out fresh, human-grade food for all members of the family,\" Petco CEO Ron Coughlin said in a release. Coughlin said the growing \"humanization\" of animal companions is being led by Gen Z and Millennial consumers who are \"hyper focused\" on their pets' health and wellness. In addition to more premium foods, Chewy and Petco see their health products and services as a way to better compete with the low-price offerings from retailers such as Amazon and Walmart. Earlier this month, Chewy expanded its health offerings with CarePlus, a line of pet wellness and insurance offerings. For its second quarter, Chewy said net sales rose 12.8% from a year ago to $2.43 billion as shoppers shifted toward more fresh and premium food products. Petco said its sales rose 3.2% to $1.48 billion and reported a similar shift. Still, the pet category isn't shielded from the soaring inflation that's pressuring consumers. Both Petco and Chewy reported softening demand in products such as crates, beds, leashes and toys over the summer months. Chewy noted that such items don't have to be replaced as often as some other items, and that shoppers are opting to skip on them as prices rise. Chewy said the downturn in such products is temporary and that it expects demand will recover. Brian LaRose, Petco's chief financial officer, also said orders for the products \"are delayed, not canceled.\" Still, both companies tightened their full-year guidance, in part because of the softened demand. Both companies lowered their revenue guidance for the year. Petco said it now expects adjusted earnings per share of 77 to 81 cents. It previously forecast 97 cents to $1. Petco's shares are down down around 24% year to date, while Chewy's stock is down around 41%."},

In a filing with the SEC, Nvidia said the U.S. government told the company on Aug. 26, about a new license requirement for future exports to China, including Hong Kong, to reduce the risk that the products may be used by the Chinese military. Nvidia said the restriction would affect the A100 and H100 products, which are graphics processing units sold to businesses. \"The license requirement also includes any future Nvidia integrated circuit achieving both peak performance and chip-to-chip I/O performance equal to or greater than thresholds that are roughly equivalent to the A100, as well as any system that includes those circuits,\" the filing said. The company expects that it could lose $400 million in potential sales in China in the current quarter after previously forecasting revenue of $5.9 billion. The new rule also applies to sales to Russia, but Nvidia said it doesn't have paying customers there. In recent years, the U.S. government has applied increasing export restrictions to chips made with U.S. technology because of fears that Chinese companies could use them for military purposes or steal trade secrets. Nvidia said it was applying for a license to continue some Chinese exports but doesn't know whether the U.S. government will grant an exemption. \"We are working with our customers in China to satisfy their planned or future purchases with alternative products and may seek licenses where replacements aren't sufficient,\" an Nvidia spokesperson told CNBC. \"The only current products that the new licensing requirement applies to are A100, H100 and systems such as DGX that include them.\" An AMD representative confirmed to CNBC that it had also received new licensing requirements from the U.S. Department of Commerce which it believed applied to its MI250 circuit, which is intended for artificial intellegence. AMD said it did not believe the new requirements would cause a material impact to its business. In a statement to CNBC, a department spokesperson said \"While we are not in a position to outline specific policy changes at this time, we are taking a comprehensive approach to implement additional actions necessary related to technologies, end-uses, and end-users to protect U.S. national security and foreign policy interests.\" WATCH: Semiconductor market signaling a surplus"},

The company also raised its outlook for the year. Shares rose about 9% in off-hours trading. Here's what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by Refinitiv: Same store sales grew 23%, which beat StreetAccount's estimate of 17.6%. Net sales rose 29% to $1.87 billion. The company said that traffic remains strong both in stores and online, even as surging inflation cramps consumers' spending. Lululemon has a higher-income customer base that seems mostly unfettered by inflationary pressures. Still, other higher-end retailers like Nordstrom and Macy's slashed their outlook this quarter on fears of slowing demand. Lululemon, on the other hand, has boosted its guidance in two consecutive quarters. \"Despite the challenges around us in the macro-environment, guest traffic in our stores and on our e-commerce sites remains robust, which speaks to the strength of our multi-dimensional operating model,\" Chief Financial Officer Meghan Frank said in a news release. Store traffic increased over 30%, and ecommerce traffic rose over 40%, executives said on the earnings call Thursday. The company is hoping to boost customer loyalty with a soon-to-launch membership program. The membership program was announced at the end of the first quarter. It has a free tier and a $39 per month paid tier which give subscribers early access to product drops and exclusive items, as well as invitations to in-person events. The company said the traffic increases were not attributable to promotional programs or product markdowns. \"We have not changed our promotional cadence,\" CEO Calvin McDonald said on the earnings call. \"We have no plans to do so.\" Lululemon continued brick-and-mortar expansion during the quarter, with 21 net new stores for a total of 600 locations. Inventories were up 85% to $1.5 billion compared to the same period last year, but the company said it was \"under-inventoried\" at the time due to supply chain bottlenecks. Retailers in general have had to contend with swelling inventory levels as shoppers adjust their spending habits. Lululemon said Thursday it is confident the inventory level will help it boost sales during the holiday shopping season. The company said it now expects 2022 revenue of between $7.865 billion and $7.940 billion, up from the range of $7.610 billion to $7.710 billion it stated last quarter. The company also raised its adjusted earnings per share outlook to a range of $9.75 to $9.90, from last quarter's guidance of $9.35 to $9.50 adjusted. The release also maintained the company's long-term outlook of doubling net revenue to $12.5 billion from from 2021 to 2026. The plan includes an expansion of its menswear business, footwear, and membership-based fitness classes. Upon the plan's announcement in the spring, some analysts were skeptical about Lululemon's ability to achieve the lofty longer-term target. Lululemon touted some early success with the plan. It launched new shoes during the quarter, while its men's business saw 27% growth. The company also reported growth across all of the countries in which stores are currently active.

During an interview at the Ambrosetti Forum in Italy it was put to Starace that, in some people's view, oil and gas would be key for energy over the next 25 years, a contention he disputed. \"I totally disagree, because this is a view that is coming from, say, 15 years ago,\" he said. \"Was that wrong at that time? No, it was not. Now it's wrong.\" \"The economy can work much better, relying much less on fossil fuels, than people think,\" he went on to add. \"It will take maybe another two years before everybody understands that \u2014 but we are there.\" Despite this optimism about the future, today's reality on the ground is hugely challenging. The current situation in Europe, where many countries are attempting to wean themselves off Russian energy following the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine, illustrates the crucial role fossil fuels still play in society. With colder months closing in, European nations have been looking to shore up gas storage in a bid to ensure security of supply. Looking ahead, Enel's Starace expressed confidence Europe had prepared for the coming winter. \"Insofar as storage is concerned, Europe \u2026 did the right thing,\" he said, noting that most countries were \"pretty full.\" \"Now, the question is what happens if gas is cut altogether from Russia,\" Starace went on to state. \"Well, we're almost there, the cut is actually almost there.\" \"We have a view, and there are many studies showing that with some sacrifices, [such as] two notches of temperature down, and a little bit of attention to gas consumptions \u2026 Europe can make it through the wintertime.\" \"The question is when we get to the spring [of] 2023 with totally depleted, really, reserves, and gas is still not flowing,\" he said. \"Is Europe able to re-establish the storage, with all the backup of floating regasifiers and energy coming from other parts of the world? I think that's going to be the big challenge.\" The Enel Group \u2014 whose main shareholder is the Italian Ministry of Economy and Finance \u2014 has said it will abandon gas generation by 2040. It also plans to leave the retail gas market in 2040. Starace's comments came on the same day that the EU's climate chief, Frans Timmermans, hammered home the urgency of the situation facing European economies in the face of rising energy prices and concerns about supply. \"We need to do everything we can to face this energy crisis and to make sure that we do everything we can to reduce the prices so that our citizens can still afford to heat their homes this winter,\" Timmermans, who was speaking to CNBC's Silvia Amaro at an event in Bali, Indonesia, said. He also stressed the importance of member states being \"in a position to address the issue of windfall profits, if necessary.\" \"So we'll try everything to make sure that our energy markets are functioning, and are functioning in a way that addresses the issues that we need to tackle.\" Timmermans was asked if \"doing everything\" meant the EU agreeing, in the short term, to imposing caps on the price of gas and electricity. \"Well, nothing's off the table right now,\" he replied. \"We're preparing all of that, but we have to make sure that what we do doesn't create more damage than it helps us address the issue.\" \"So we have to be extremely careful. It took us 30 years to build the energy markets, so we need to make sure we address today's issue without creating long term problems.\""},

Speaking to CNBC at the Ambrosetti Forum in Italy, Ferguson said the catalyst events had already occurred to spark a repeat of the 70s, a period characterized by financial shocks, political clashes and civil unrest. Yet this time, the severity of those shocks was likely to be greater and more sustained. \"The ingredients of the 1970s are already in place,\" Ferguson, Milbank Family Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University, told CNBC's Steve Sedgwick. \"The monetary and fiscal policy mistakes of last year, which set this inflation off, are very alike to the 60s,\" he said, likening recent price hikes to the 1970's doggedly high inflation. \"And, as in 1973, you get a war,\" he continued, referring to the 1973 Arab-Israeli War \u2014 also known as the Yom Kippur War \u2014 between Israel and a coalition of Arab states led by Egypt and Syria. As with Russia's current war in Ukraine, the 1973 Arab-Israeli War led to international involvement from then-superpowers the Soviet Union and the U.S., sparking a wider energy crisis. Only that time, the conflict lasted just 20 days. Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine has now entered into its sixth month, suggesting that any repercussions for energy markets could be far worse. \"This war is lasting much longer than the 1973 war, so the energy shock it is causing is actually going to be more sustained,\" said Ferguson. Politicians and central bankers have been vying to mitigate the worst effects of the fallout, by raising interest rates to combat inflation and reducing reliance on Russian energy imports. But Ferguson, who has authored 16 books, including his most recent \"Doom: The Politics of Catastrophe,\" said there was no evidence to suggest that current crises could be avoided. \"Why shouldn't it be as bad as the 1970s?\" he said. \"I'm going to go out on a limb: Let's consider the possibility that the 2020s could actually be worse than the 1970s.\" Among the reasons for that, he said, were currently lower productivity growth, higher debt levels and less favorable demographics now versus 50 years ago. \"At least in the 1970s you had detente between superpowers. I don't see much detente between Washington and Beijing right now. In fact, I see the opposite,\" he said, referring to recent clashes over Taiwan. Humans like to believe that global shocks happen with some degree of order or predictability. But that, Ferguson said, is a fallacy. In fact, rather than being evenly spread throughout history, like a bell curve, disasters tend to happen non-linearly and all at once, he said. \"The distributions in history really aren't normal, particularly when it comes to things like wars and financial crises or, for that matter, pandemics,\" said Ferguson. \"You start with a plague \u2014 or something we don't see very often, a really large global pandemic \u2014 which kills millions of people and disrupts the economy in all kinds of ways. Then you hit it with a big monetary and fiscal policy shock. And then you add the geopolitical shock.\" That miscalculation leads humans to be overly optimistic and, ultimately, unprepared to handle major crises, he said. \"In their heads, the world is kind of a bunch of averages, and there aren't likely to be really bad outcomes. This leads people ... to be somewhat overoptimistic,\" he said. As an example, Ferguson said he surveyed attendees at Ambrosetti \u2014 a forum in Italy attended by political leaders and the business elite \u2014 and found low single-digit percentages expect to see a decline in investment in Italy over the coming months. \"This is a country that's heading towards a recession,\" he said."},

The buyout offers, which are being outlined to Buick dealers Friday, are the latest efforts by GM to accelerate the company's electric vehicle plans and transform its sales network. All of Buick's roughly 2,000 U.S. franchise dealers will be given the opportunity to take a buyout, Duncan Aldred, global head of Buick, told The Wall Street Journal. \"Not everyone necessarily wants to make that journey, depending on where they're located or the level of expenditure that the transition will demand,\" he told the publication. \"So if they want to exit the Buick franchise, then we will give them monetary assistance to do so.\" Michelle Malcho, a company spokeswoman, on Friday confirmed the buyout plans to CNBC but declined to disclose the expected cost or how many dealers GM anticipates will take the offer. Many Buick dealers also sell GMC vehicles or another one of GM's U.S. brands. The company offered similar buyouts to Cadillac dealers in 2020. About 150, or 17%, of those 880 retailers accepted the offer rather than assume expectations to invest at least $200,000 toward upgrading dealerships for electric vehicles. Buyout offers for Cadillac dealers ranged from about $300,000 to more than $1 million, a person familiar with the plans previously told CNBC. Malcho declined to disclose how much Buick dealers would be offered. Buick's EV plans are part of a broader $30 billion investment by GM into electric vehicles by 2025. That investment is expected to lead to about 30 new EVs globally from the automaker, which has pledged to exclusively offer electric vehicles by 2035."},

Narasimhan most recently served as CEO of health and hygiene company Reckitt, which owns brands such as Lysol, Durex and Mucinex. He announced earlier Thursday he was stepping down from that role. He'll join Starbucks in October, learning about the company and its reinvention plan, before assuming the top job in April. Until then, Howard Schultz will continue as interim CEO of the coffee chain he grew into a global giant. Schultz will remain on Starbucks' board after Narasimhan succeeds him. Schultz has been at the helm since April, when his handpicked successor Kevin Johnson retired after five years on the job. Schultz returned to the company as its interim CEO, earning just $1 for his salary. In the meantime, Schultz and the Starbucks board hunted for a long-term successor, with the intention of announcing the new CEO in the fall. (The coffee chain brought back the Pumpkin Spice Latte and other fall menu items on Tuesday.) Schultz has previously said that he wants to reinvent the employee, customer and store experience to reckon with how the world has changed since the pandemic. The company is holding an investor day on Sept. 13 in Seattle, where it's expected to unveil more details about the bold changes it plans to make. Starbucks said in a news release that Schultz will remain \"closely involved\" with the plan and act as an advisor to Narasimhan. Narasimhan previously worked at PepsiCo, serving as its global chief commercial officer among other roles. Prior to working at the food and beverage giant, he was a senior partner at McKinsey. As CEO, he'll have to tackle a number of challenges. In its home market, Starbucks is facing a union push, with more than 200 stores in the U.S. voting to organize under Workers United. The battle has resulted in negative headlines and legal battles. Inflation hasn't hurt sales yet, but it has pushed menu prices higher. And China, its second-largest market, is struggling to bounce back from the pandemic, hampered by the country's zero Covid policy. \"His deep, hands-on experience driving strategic transformations at global consumer-facing businesses makes him the ideal choice to accelerate Starbucks growth and capture the opportunities ahead of us,\" Starbucks board chair Mellody Hobson said in a statement."},

Many U.S. franchisees cheered the decision, but customers have been asking the company's Twitter account about when all-day breakfast will return. A Twitter user revived the conversation on Thursday, tweeting a screenshot of a McDonald's press release that said all-day breakfast would be served starting Oct. 6. But bad news for Egg McMuffin lovers: a McDonald's representative confirmed that the release is from 2015, when the chain created its all-day breakfast menu. Former CEO Steve Easterbrook launched the menu as part of a turnaround plan to revitalize the burger chain's sluggish sales, and the company credited the move for driving sales growth. But it looks unlikely that the all-day breakfast menu will return. Even before the pandemic, operators had been asking the company to whittle down all-day breakfast items to speed up service. As McDonald's management began looking to add menu items back after lockdowns ended, CEO Chris Kempczinski told analysts that his team was working with franchisees to make sure \"every item that we add earns its way back onto the menu.\" With franchisee relations at a low point now over disagreements to new ownership terms, bringing back all-day breakfast could further fuel tensions."},

It represents yet another example of beverage companies blurring the lines between drink categories, seeking to leverage existing brand loyalty while entering fast-growing categories. Gatorade's parent company, PepsiCo, has already expanded Mountain Dew into alcoholic and energy drinks. The company says Fast Twitch is designed to give athletes an extra boost before their workouts. The market for preworkout powders is growing, fueled by industry leaders such as Cellucor C4 and RSP Nutrition. But few preworkout drinks exist, and many consumers instead turn to carbonated, sugary energy drinks. Anuj Bhasin, general manager of Gatorade, said roughly 32 million consumers reject the energy drink category for the negative health effects. Fast Twitch aims to attract those consumers, offering plenty of caffeine but no sugar or carbonation. The new drink is slated to launch in February, but NFL players will be drinking it on sidelines during the upcoming season as part of an exclusive deal with the league. Bhasin said Gatorade worked with the NFL and its sports performance experts to develop the specific formula. The finished product comes in a petite 12-ounce bottle with brightly colored packaging. While smaller, it tastes pretty similar to traditional Gatorade. A bottle of Fast Twitch contains electrolytes, B-vitamins and 200 milligrams of caffeine. For comparison, a 12-ounce can of Red Bull has nearly half as much caffeine but 37 grams of sugar. Bolt24, another recent offshoot of Gatorade, has just 75 milligrams of caffeine in its Energize line, which is being phased out. \"Two hundred milligrams is the right amount to help athletes seeking benefits for exercise performance,\" said Matthew Pahnke, senior principal scientist at the Gatorade Sports Science Institute. Since its creation nearly six decades ago, Gatorade has built its brand on hydration, spreading the word about the benefits of electrolytes and carbohydrates. But caffeine is a natural diuretic, removing salt and water from the body. As a result, Fast Twitch is meant to precede drinking a more hydrating beverage during an actual workout, the company says. \"We know athletes will mix and match things,\" Pahnke said. Fast Twitch will target consumers who are 18 years old or older due to the high caffeine content, according to Bhasin. Fast Twitch follows a broader push by Pepsi into energy drinks. Over the last three years, the company bought Rockstar Energy for $3.85 billion, launched Mtn Dew Rise Energy with the endorsement of NBA superstar Lebron James and acquired a minority stake in up-and-coming energy drink maker Celsius for $550 million. Celsius is a potential competitor for Fast Twitch. The upstart markets its beverages as \"fitness drinks,\" and its marketing shows models swinging kettle bells and stretching. Another challenger also has ties to Gatorade's parent company. Bang Energy, which recently ended an acrimonious distribution deal with Pepsi, markets itself as a preworkout or recovery drink. Beyond being highly caffeinated, it touts \"super creatine,\" which claims to boost muscle performance, but no sugar. But Pepsi is already the dominant leader in the U.S. sports drink category, holding 73.2% market share with Gatorade and G Zero, according to Euromonitor International data. Bodyarmor jumped to second place in 2021 with 11.7% market share, overtaking Coca-Cola 's Powerade. Coke purchased full control of Bodyarmor in November for $5.6 billion in a play to increase its market share. Changing consumer tastes led to slowing sales growth for the sports drink market, even as U.S. adults exercise more. Years of backlash from lawmakers and pediatricians about sports drinks' high sugar and calorie counts didn't help either. But Gatorade staged a comeback, focusing on options with more electrolytes and less sugar, such as recent spin-offs G Fit, Gatorlyte and Bolt24. In the second quarter, Pepsi reported double-digit revenue growth for the Gatorade brand. However, not all of Gatorade's innovations have paid off. An organic version of the drink released in 2016 failed to take off and was discontinued several years later. Energy represents an opportunity in a fast-growing segment, but it lacks trust from consumers who exercise. Gatorade, on the other hand, has earned plenty of trust from that customer base. \"We found this to be the sweet spot of bringing a new brand to market, with the distinction of being from the makers of Gatorade, much like Propel,\" Bhasin said."},

One in 5 sellers in August dropped their asking price, according to Realtor.com. A year ago that share was just 11%. The average home sold for less than its list price for the first time in over 17 months during the four-week period ended Aug. 28, according to a report by Redfin. Homes are simply not selling at the breakneck pace they were six months ago, when strong demand butted up against tight supply, bidding wars were the norm, and a seller could often get a signed contract in under a weekend. Homes in August sat on the market an average five days longer than they did a year ago \u2014 the first annual increase in time on the market in more than two years. The supply of homes for sale is also rising fast, up nearly 27% from a year ago, even as fewer sellers decide to list. Pending sales in July, which represent signed contracts on existing homes and which are the most recent sales data available, were nearly 20% lower than July 2021, according to the National Association of Realtors. \"For many of today's buyers, the uptick in for-sale home options is taking away the sense of urgency that they felt during the past two years, when inventory was scarce,\" said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com. \"As a result of this shift, coupled with higher mortgage rates, competition continued to cool in August, with listing price trends indicating that home shoppers are tightening their purse strings.\" The median listing price in August dropped to $435,000 from $449,000 in July, according to Realtor.com. Mortgage rates have been rising since January, hitting a recent high in June and then falling back slightly in July and much of August. They are, however, rising again and are now nearly matching that June high. Redfin reported that requests for home tours and other homebuying services from its agents at the end of August was down 16% from the same period the year before. Touring activity was also down 9% from the start of the year, compared with an 11% increase at the same time last year, according to home tour technology company ShowingTime. \"The post-Labor Day slowdown will likely be a little more intense this year than in previous years when the market was super tight,\" said Daryl Fairweather, Redfin's chief economist. \"Expect homes to linger on the market, which may lead to another small uptick in the share of sellers lowering their prices.\""},

The Detroit automaker reported August sales of 158,088 new vehicles in the U.S., a 27% increase from August 2021, when the company's production and sales were significantly impacted by a shortage of semiconductor chips. Last month's sales were down 3.6% compared to July, including an 8% decline in its F-Series pickup trucks. Those sales were in line with analyst expectations, though. The company said its Ford brand was America's best-selling brand for a second consecutive month. Sales of Ford's profitable F-Series pickups were up 1.7% for the month from August 2021 but off 10.7% for the first eight months of the year compared with the same period last year. The company has sold 6,842 models of its all-electric F-150 Lightning pickup as of Aug. 31, including 2,373 vehicles last month. \"F-Series was America's best-selling truck, best-selling hybrid truck and best-selling electric truck with F-150 Lightning in August. Ford's overall electric vehicle portfolio expanded four--fold in July, while conquesting from competitors at a rate over 60%,\" Andrew Frick, Ford vice president of sales, distribution and trucks, said in a release. Ford's 2022 electric vehicle sales totaled more than 36,500 units through August. That included sales of about 5,900 vehicles in August, which was 23% lower than the prior month but up more than 300% from a year ago. Year-to-date sales of all Ford's vehicles, including its luxury Lincoln brand, totaled more than 1.2 million units through August, a 0.2% decrease from a year ago. At the end of last month, the automaker's U.S. vehicle inventory, including dealer stock and in-transit vehicle, was about 259,000 units, up from 254,000 in July. J.D. Power and LMC Automotive estimate total U.S. new vehicle sales last month topped 980,000 units, which would be 2.6% lower than August 2021 \u2013 the first month the auto industry's vehicle inventories were significantly impacted by an ongoing shortage of semiconductor chips. RBC Capital Markets said the seasonally adjusted annualized rate, or SAAR, for new vehicles was 13.4 million, slightly higher than its 13.2 million forecast and in line with July's 13.5 million. The SAAR is a closely watched metric by analysts and investors."},

Bartiromo, the anchor of Fox programs \"Mornings with Maria\" and \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" is slated to appear for a deposition on Sept. 8, according to court filings. In recent days, Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson and Jeanine Pirro were among the network hosts scheduled to appear for questioning in Dominion's lawsuit, which is seeking $1.6 billion in damages from the cable news network. Dominion has argued that Fox Corp. 's Fox News and Fox Business made false claims that its voting machines rigged the results of the 2020 election between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Top brass Rupert Murdoch and Lachlan Murdoch are also expected to be deposed since the parent company has been sued, too. The case is being closely watched by First Amendment experts and advocates in part because of Dominion's lengthy list of examples that Fox network hosts repeatedly made false claims, even after the facts came to light. Libel lawsuits are often centered around one falsehood, and media companies are broadly protected by the First Amendment. Such cases are usually settled out of court or dismissed quickly by a court judge, experts say. But in December, the Delaware judge overseeing the Dominion case denied Fox News' request to have the case dismissed. Neither side has shown signs of entering discussions or reaching a settlement, according to people familiar with the matter, although that could change before the trial's expected start in April. Fox has vigorously denied the claims. \"Fox has put forth a First Amendment argument that this defamation case is aimed at punishing their speech and journalism, and this is an important component of their argument,\" said Roy Gutterman, an expert on communications law and free speech at Syracuse University's Newhouse School of Public Communications. But Gutterman said those rights can be limited \"by the concept of falsity, especially if it can bring harm to an individual or business.\" The depositions are private, as are the documents that Dominion has been collecting through the discovery process. Fox has asked the court to keep all of the collected materials private, claiming that Dominion mischaracterized what the documents show as actual malice. In court papers, Dominion has pointed to the rhetoric of hosts like Bartiromo, a former CNBC anchor, and former host Lou Dobbs and that they continued to feature guests \u2013 including Trump attorneys Rudy Giuliani and Sydney Powell \u2013 who made false claims that voter fraud was the reason Trump didn't surpass Biden to win the 2020 election. Dobbs was also previously scheduled for questioning, filings show. \"Fox, one of the most powerful media companies in the United States, gave life to a manufactured storyline about election fraud that cast a then-little-known voting machine company called Dominion as the villain,\" the company said in its initial court filing in March 2021. Fox News' legal team recently added veteran trial attorney Dan Webb to its roster. Webb told the Washington Post earlier this week that Fox News was only reporting on the news and claims being made by Trump's allies. \"We are confident we will prevail as freedom of the press is foundational to our democracy and must be protected, in addition to the damages claims being outrageous, unsupported and not rooting in sound financial analysis, serving as nothing more than a flagrant attempt to deter our journalists from doing their jobs,\" a Fox News spokesperson said in a statement. To win a defamation case, a plaintiff needs to show that the individual or business they're suing made false statements that caused harm, and that it acted with \"actual malice,\" meaning the speaker knew or should have known what they were saying wasn't true. \"A key issue in these depositions will be the state of mind of Fox as embodied by the journalists covering this or commenting on it,\" said Floyd Abrams, a prominent First Amendment attorney. \"What will someone like Lou Dobbs say? Will he say he believed what he was saying beyond simple reportage?\" Dominion said in court papers that it repeatedly sent emails to notify Fox News that its anchors and their guests were making false claims \u2013 and that Dominion had \"independent fact-checkers, government officials and election security experts\" that quashed those claims. Other current and former Fox News executives have been called on for depositions, court filings show. Dominion has also filed lawsuits against the TV networks One America News and Newsmax. Another voting machine maker, Smartmatic USA, has made similar claims in a defamation lawsuit against Fox News that alleged Dobbs and other hosts falsely accused the company of helping to rig the election. A New York judge earlier this year denied Fox News' motion to dismiss the lawsuit. Shortly after Smartmatic filed its lawsuit, Fox News canceled Dobbs' weekday business show, \"Lou Dobbs Tonight.\" Fox has previously said the move to end Dobbs' program was in the works prior to the lawsuit."},

The defendants, Aimee Harris, 40, and Robert Kurlander, 58, conspired to steal items from Florida and transport them over state lines in September 2020, when Ashley's father was the Democratic nominee for the White House, according to a charging document. Kurlander as part of his plea in U.S. District Court in Manhattan agreed to cooperate with federal prosecutors, who are continuing to investigate how the diary was obtained by Project Veritas, the right-wing group that specializes in provocative videos and investigations designed to embarrass media outlets and other targets. Neither Biden was identified by name in the charging document released Thursday. But the details of the case match with what has been previously reported about an investigation by federal prosecutors in New York into the theft of Ashley's diary, which occurred weeks before the 2020 presidential election. The charging document says the father of the theft's victim was a \"then-former government official who was a candidate for national office.\" President Biden is a former U.S. senator and vice president. Ashley's diary, which she had left in a Delray Beach, Florida, home she was renting, and other items were ultimately sold for $40,000 to Project Veritas, which has offices in Mamaroneck, New York. Harris, who is a resident of Palm Beach, later temporarily stayed at the same residence where Ashley had lived, and discovered items that included a journal with \"highly personal entries\" and a digital storage card that the victim left behind, according to the charging document. The charging document says Project Veritas purchased the stolen property from Harris and the Jupiter resident Kurlander paid each of them $20,000. The charging document says that Harris asked Kurlander for his assistance in selling certain items of the victim's property. The document said that Harris and Kurlander in September 2020 attended a campaign fundraiser in Florida for a person, identified as Candidate-2, who was running against the victim's father. That fundraiser is understood to be one held for then-President Donald Trump. Four days later, a representative from Trump's campaign told Harris and Kurlander that the campaign was not interested in buying the stolen property, the charging document says. Kurlander then texted Harris, saying, \"[Candidate-2] campaign can't use it. They want it to go to the FBI. There is NO WAY [Candidate-2] can use this. It has to be done a different way.\" Manhattan U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in a statement Thursday, \"Harris and Kurlander stole personal property from an immediate family member of a candidate for national political office.\" \"They sold the property to an organization in New York for $40,000 and even returned to take more of the victim's property when asked to do so,\" Williams said. \"Harris and Kurlander sought to profit from their theft of another person's personal property, and they now stand convicted of a federal felony as a result,\" he said. Both defendants face a possible maximum sentence of five years in prison on the charge of conspiracy to commit interstate transportation of stolen property. They each agreed to forfeit $20,000 as part of their guilty pleas. FBI agents last November searched several locations that belonged to current and former members of Project Veritas as part of the probe of the Biden diary theft. Project Veritas CEO James O'Keefe, in a statement issued at that time, said that the organization had been approached by people offering it the Biden diary. But O'Keefe said the group decided not to publish the contents of the diary, and later turned it over to law enforcement when Ashley's lawyer refused to accept it. \"At the end of the day, we made the ethical decision that because, in part, we could not determine if the diary was real, if the diary in fact belonged to Ashley Biden, or if the contents of the diary occurred, we could not publish the diary and any part thereof,\" O'Keefe said at the time."},

The order Thursday came hours after the Department of Justice submitted a proposal in U.S District Court for the Southern District of Florida detailing how it wanted portions of that affidavit kept secret if the document were to be made public. That proposal itself is sealed, making it impossible to know what the DOJ wants to be kept hidden in the search warrant affidavit. But Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart in his order wrote that he agreed the DOJ \"has met its burden\" in showing there was a compelling reason to keep portions of the affidavit out of the public eye. Reinhart said the redactions were warranted because disclosure would reveal the identities of law enforcement agents, witnesses, and uncharged parties, as well as \"the investigation's strategy\" and direction, and \"grand jury information.\" FBI agents, carrying the warrant issued on the basis of the affidavit, on Aug. 8 raided Trump's residence at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach. They seized a dozen or so boxes of documents as part of a criminal investigation of the removal of presidential records from the White House when he left office in January 2021. Many of those documents were highly classified. The DOJ probe is eyeing possible obstruction of justice and violations of the U.S. espionage act and the law prohibiting the removal of official records. By law, presidential records must be given to the National Archives and Records Administration when a president leaves office. A group of media organizations had asked Reinhart to unseal the entire affidavit. That document, like other such affidavits submitted with search warrant applications, would detail why authorities believed there was probable cause that a crime had been committed. The affidavit also would describe what evidence authorities believed might be at the target location. But Reinhart, in his order Thursday, wrote, \"I further find that the Government has met its burden of showing that its proposed redactions are narrowly tailored to serve the Government's legitimate interest in the integrity of the ongoing investigation and are the least onerous alternative to sealing the entire Affidavit.\""},

The decision will affect flights by Xiamen, Air China, China Southern Airlines and China Eastern Airlines from Sept. 5 to Sept. 28. The U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) cited the recent cancellation of 26 American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines flights over Covid-19 cases. The suspensions include 19 China-bound flights from Los Angeles and 7 China Eastern flights from New York. The Chinese Embassy in Washington's spokesperson Liu Pengyu said the USDOT action was \"extremely irresponsible\" and \"groundlessly suspended Chinese airline flights.\" The embassy said China's Covid-19 \"circuit breaker\" measures were fair and transparent, applied both to Chinese and foreign airlines and were consistent with bilateral air transportation agreements. USDOT said as of Aug. 7 Chinese authorities had revised their policies so if the number of passengers on a flight to China testing positive for Covid-19 reached 4% of the total, one flight would be suspended. If it reached 8%, two flights would be suspended. USDOT said the U.S. has repeatedly raised objections with China, saying the rules place \"undue culpability on carriers\" when travelers test negative before boarding their flight from the United States only to \"test positive for Covid-19 after their arrival in China.\" Beijing and Washington have sparred over air services since the start of the pandemic. In January, the Transportation Department suspended 44 China-bound flights from the United States by the four Chinese carriers in response to China's decision suspend 44 flights by U.S. carriers. In August 2021, USDOT limited four flights from Chinese carriers to 40% passenger capacity for four weeks after Beijing imposed identical limits on four United Airlines flights. Three U.S. airlines and four Chinese carriers typically operate about 20 flights a week between the countries, well below the figure of more than 100 a week before the pandemic."},

The city's Department of Consumer and Worker Protection said the case marks its first lawsuit for a violation of New York City's \"just cause\" protections for fast-food workers. Austin Locke, a longtime barista and union organizer, was fired less than a month after he and his coworkers voted to unionize a Starbucks in Queens, according to the lawsuit. The store is one of dozens of Starbucks locations that have voted to unionize. Starbucks had said that Locke was fired for failing to fill out a Covid-19 questionnaire and falsely reporting that a supervisor made physical contact with him, according to the city's lawsuit. The missteps were reportedly confirmed by surveillance footage, but the suit states that Locke's district and store manager did not let him see that footage. Locke's shifts were canceled, and he filed a complaint to the city days later. \"We do not comment on pending litigation,\" a Starbucks representative wrote to CNBC. \"However, we do intend to defend against the alleged violations of the New York City Just Cause Law.\" Under the city's Fair Workweek law, it is illegal to fire workers who have completed a 30 day probation or reduce their hours by more than 15% without just cause or an economic justification. The city is suing to get Locke reinstated and to win him restitution and back pay, which the city says will continue to accrue until Locke returns to his job. \"It's been a year since the campaign with Starbucks Workers United began at a Starbucks in Buffalo, NY,\" said Austin Locke in a statement released by the city. \"There are now 235 unionized Starbucks around the country. Starbucks continues to wrongfully fire pro-union workers nationwide in retaliation for union organizing.\" Starbucks has seen a wave of stores unionize across the country, and organizers have brought claims of retaliation by the company.

Mark Kelly in November's election, according to people familiar with the matter. Masters has received urgent private calls in recent weeks from GOP leaders like Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., the head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, these people explained. The NRSC is the official campaign arm for the Senate GOP, and has spent over $6 million taking on Masters' rival Kelly, according to data from the nonpartisan OpenSecrets. Kelly's seat has long been considered a potential pickup opportunity for Republicans, as forecaster Cook Political Report labels the race a toss-up. Recent polling, however, suggests that Masters is falling behind. A Fox News poll taken in August shows Kelly leading Masters by 8 points, while an Arizona Republican pollster told NBC News that his own surveys showed Masters trailing Kelly by 10 points. Longtime GOP megadonors, who want to help Masters overtake Kelly but have not heard from him since he won the party's primary, have inundated the Republican candidate with calls, these people explained. A person familiar with one of the recent calls to Masters said a veteran GOP financier \"read him the riot act\" and told him, in part, that he must start raising money from more wealthy Republican donors and stop relying on billionaire tech executive Peter Thiel, his longtime colleague and friend, to help him like he did in the primary. These people declined to be named in order to speak freely about private conversations. Shortly after publication of this story, Katie Miller, a spokeswoman for the Masters campaign, denied that the candidate ever heard from a GOP megadonor who \"read him the riot act.\" Miller told CNBC in an email: \"It didn't happen.\" Kelly has massively outraised Masters, who won a Republican primary in Arizona this month. The incumbent's campaign has amassed more than $54 million during the 2022 election cycle, compared with just over $4 million for Masters' campaign, according to the latest Federal Election Commission data. Thiel contributed $15 million during the primary to a pro-Masters super PAC, Saving Arizona, and he donated $1.5 million to the committee as recently as July. Masters was the chief operating officer at Thiel Capital, an investment firm founded by Thiel. The calls to Masters come as even some Republican leaders seem to be questioning their Senate candidates. When asked about his predictions for the midterms, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said\"candidate quality\" has a lot to do with winning Senate elections. He added that he believes there will be an \"extremely close Senate\" after November's elections. The Senate is currently split 50-50 between Democrats and Republicans. In a statement to CNBC, NRSC spokesman Chris Hartline did not deny that Scott called Masters to urge him to improve his fundraising operation. \"Mark Kelly votes with Joe Biden almost 100% of the time. While he claims to be a moderate, he's supported reckless Washington spending and done nothing to address the border crisis that's raging in Arizona. The NRSC will continue to remind Arizona voters of Mark Kelly's radical agenda and Blake Masters' plans to fight for Arizona families,\" Hartline said in response to questions about Scott's contact with Masters. Data from ad tracker AdImpact shows that the NRSC has booked just over $3.8 million in ads in Arizona for September, but nothing yet for October or November. The ad tracker also shows that Masters' campaign has not yet booked airtime for the fall while Kelly's team has reserved over $10 million in ad space from September through November. AdImpact says it has not yet seen data showing the Thiel-backed Saving Arizona reserve airtime for the fall. The last spending it saw from the super PAC was on Aug. 2, the day of the Arizona Senate Republican primary. The super PAC spent over $10 million during the primary, including almost $8.5 million backing Masters, according to OpenSecrets. Masters and his campaign did not return requests for comment. A spokesman for Saving Arizona did not return requests for comment. Thiel and his spokesman did not return requests for comment, including about whether the billionaire GOP donor plans to help Masters further. The candidates and outside groups from both sides of the aisle have combined to spend over $90 million in the general election Senate race in Arizona. Yet Democratic organizations appear to be outspending their Republican rivals in the Grand Canyon State on ads in the coming months. AdImpact's data shows Democratic outside groups are reserving nearly $28 million worth of ad time in Arizona over the next three months. Republican committees have so far spent just over $16 million on ad buys within the same time span trying to help Masters overtake Kelly, according to the data."},

The FBI had probable cause to believe that records containing classified national defense information would be found at the Palm Beach, Florida, residence, according to an agent who wrote the 32-page affidavit. \"There is also probable cause to believe that evidence of obstruction will be found\" at Trump's home, read an unredacted portion of the affidavit. A federal judge had ordered the key document's release over the objections of the DOJ, which argued it contains highly sensitive facts about the ongoing criminal investigation into Trump. U.S. Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart accepted the DOJ's proposed redactions to the affidavit one day before it was made public. Click here or scroll down to read the heavily redacted affidavit. \"The government is conducting a criminal investigation concerning the improper removal and storage of classified information in unauthorized spaces, as well as the unlawful concealment and removal of government records,\" the FBI agent, whose name was blacked out, wrote in the affidavit's first line. The agent then wrote that the probe began because of a referral from the National Archives and Records Administration in February, after NARA received 15 boxes of records from Trump's residence in Florida. By law, presidential records must be turned over to the National Archives when a president departs office. The FBI found that in those boxes were documents that bore classification markings, and included records relating to national defense information, which had been stored at Mar-a-Lago in an unsecured location. The 15 boxes included 184 specific documents marked classified, 67 of which were marked \"confidential,\" 92 marked \"secret\" and 25 documents marked \"top secret,\" according to the affidavit. \"Based upon this investigation, I do not believe that any spaces within the PREMISES have been authorized for the storage of classified information at least since the end of FPOTUS 's Presidential Administration on January 20, 2021,\" the agent wrote in the affidavit. Of the 32 pages of the affidavit, 21 pages are almost totally or significantly blacked out. The search warrant itself was revealed voluntarily by the DOJ less than a week after the Aug. 8 raid. The warrant indicated that FBI agents were looking for materials showing violations of laws against obstruction of justice and the removal of official records, as well as the U.S. Espionage Act. The FBI took at least 20 boxes of items in the August raid, including numerous sets of highly classified documents, according to a property receipt that was also made public by the DOJ. In a social media post after the redacted affidavit was released, Trump accused the FBI and DOJ of \"public relations subterfuge\" by the fact that the word \"Nuclear\" did not appear in the document \u2014 though he also noted that it was \"heavily redacted!!!\" The affidavit did not detail the specific content of documents it expected to find. Trump also lashed out at Reinhart, arguing that he should have recused himself from this matter because he had previously removed himself from another case involving the former president. The reason for that recusal was not clear, news outlets reported, but Trump claimed it was \"based on his animosity and hatred of your favorite President, me.\" The government argued last week against releasing the affidavit, even in a redacted form. \"The redactions necessary to mitigate harms to the integrity of the investigation would be so extensive as to render the remaining unsealed text devoid of meaningful content,\" read a court filing from Jay Bratt, head of the counterintelligence and export control section of the DOJ's National Security Division. Bratt also argued that the affidavit \"would serve as a roadmap to the government's ongoing investigation\" if disclosed. Reinhart disagreed, and ordered the government to propose redactions to U.S. District Court in West Palm Beach, Florida, by Thursday. The judge accepted the DOJ's redactions later that day. The government said last week that the Mar-a-Lago raid is part of a probe that \"implicates national security\" and is still in its \"early stages.\" Trump, who first revealed the FBI's search of his Florida residence, has cast himself as the victim of a political attack by the Biden administration that was carried out against the presumptive Republican front-runner in the 2024 presidential race. The former president on Monday sued the government, asking a federal judge to block the DOJ from poring over the documents seized from Mar-a-Lago until a court-appointed third party reviews them. \"The political Hacks and Thugs had no right under the Presidential Records Act to storm Mar-a-Lago and steal everything in sight, including Passports and privileged documents,\" Trump said in a social media post earlier Friday morning.

The funds sent back to the SBA were obtained via the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program using both fabricated information and stolen identities. The suspects used Green Dot Bank, a fintech institution, to hold and move the fraudulent funds. More than 15,000 accounts were used in the conspiracy, by individuals in the U.S. as well as domestic and transnational organized crime rings, the agency said. Investigations are ongoing and further information about suspects was not immediately released. The investigation was initiated by the Secret Service field office in Orlando, Florida, and Green Dot bank worked with the agency to identify the fraudulent accounts. \"Fraudsters in general are always looking for ways and techniques to better do their crimes and modern conveniences are just one of those things they use. So currently, cryptocurrency is a big thing, fintechs, third-party payment systems. But there's not an institution, even our traditional financial institutions, that weren't targeted during the pandemic,\" Roy Dotson, lead investigator for the Secret Service, told CNBC in an interview. Initial investigations indicated the majority of the fraudulent accounts at Green Dot were established with synthetic and stolen identities, and involved using \"willing and unwilling money mules,\" Dotson said. The Secret Service and SBA Office of Inspector General put out advisories to 30,000 financial institutions in early 2020 to lay out fraud indicators and guide the banks to partner with federal agencies to recover fraudulent funds, Dotson said. He added these investigations will likely last years due to their size and scope. Green Dot said it has partnered with federal agencies including the Secret Service to identify fraud in the industry. \"Account protection and fraud prevention are top priorities for us, and we work around the clock and invest heavily to identify, block and address fraudulent activity. We're committed to protecting customers, and also to serving as [a] proactive ally to government agencies and industry peers as we work together to prevent fraud,\" Green Dot spokeswoman Alison Lubert said in a statement. OIG Inspector General Hannibal Ware said the partnership with the Secret Service has to date resulted in more than 400 indictments and nearly 300 convictions related to pandemic fraud. The U.S. government allocated more than $1 trillion to Main Street under both the Paycheck Protection Program and EIDL program. The PPP allowed small businesses to borrow loans that may be forgiven if the borrower used the majority of the capital on payroll, while the Covid-19 EIDL program allowed borrowers to access loans based on temporary losses of revenue due to the pandemic. An advance grant was also available under the EIDL. Reviews of the two programs by the SBA's Office of Inspector General warned that criminals would potentially exploit the system due to the fast-moving nature of the rollout and demand for aid. CNBC investigations revealed, in some cases, how easy it was for criminals to obtain fraudulent aid via stolen identities. The SBA OIG said it has identified $87 billion of potentially fraudulent EIDL loans. Over the past two years, the Secret Service said it has seized over $1.4 billion in fraudulently obtained funds and assisted in returning some $2.3 billion to state unemployment insurance programs. Nearly 4,000 pandemic-related fraud investigations and inquiries have been initiated by the Secret Service. More than 150 field offices and 40 cyber task forces are involved. \"This is not going to be a quick fix. As we talked about today, 15,325 accounts at one financial institution \u2014 this is one case, so you can just think of the potential number of suspects and how many investigations that could come out of those. And with all of our federal, state and local partners working this and having the same mission. It's going to be a long process,\" Dotson said at a news conference announcing the returned funds."},

The previously unreported photo, released by the War College to Reuters after a request under the Freedom of Information Act, showed Mastriano in a 2013-14 portrait for the Department of Military Strategy, Plans, and Operations, where he worked. Faculty at the time had been given the option of dressing as a historical figure, people familiar with the photo said. At least 15 of the 21 faculty in the photo opted to appear in regular attire. Although one man wears a trench coat and sunglasses and another carries an aviator's helmet, Mastriano is the only one wearing a Confederate uniform. Mastriano did not immediately respond to requests for comment made by email and phone. A Reuters reporter attended a Mastriano event on Wednesday to seek comment, but the candidate did not make himself available for questions. Displays of Confederate symbols can be seen as insensitive to those who view them as painful reminders of racial oppression and the Civil War that saw 11 rebelling Confederate states fight to keep Black people enslaved. The U.S. military issued a de facto ban on displaying the Confederate flag and has sought to remove segregationist symbols from bases and academic institutions following the murder in May 2020 of George Floyd, a Black man whose killing by a white police officer in Minneapolis triggered protests worldwide. After Reuters made its formal request for the photo, it was removed from the War College wall where it had hung alongside other annual portraits of faculty groups. The Army War College (AWC), a premier military higher education institution in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, told Reuters a team had reviewed all art, text, and other images displayed at Carlisle Barracks in 2020, but missed the faculty photo. \"The faculty photo did not get the team's attention; the photo has since been removed because it does not meet AWC values,\" the college said in a statement. Asked about the War College photo, a spokesperson at U.S. Army headquarters said: \"The Army supports commanders who remove symbols or images that do not comport with Army values.\" Confederate symbols and dress have been embraced by white supremacists in the United States, and monuments and flags honoring the Confederacy have been removed from many public areas in recent years. Pennsylvania plays an outsized role in U.S. politics as a so-called swing state in presidential elections, and Republican Mastriano, who has embraced Trump's stolen election lies, is trailing his Democratic opponent in the governor's race ahead of the November ballot. It is unclear how the photo might be viewed in Pennsylvania, which played a critical role in the Civil War. More than 33,000 soldiers from Pennsylvania died fighting for the Union, and the state was the site of the Battle of Gettysburg, the conflict's bloodiest battle, which ended with a Union victory and inspired President Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. Mastriano's district, Pennsylvania's 33rd, includes Gettysburg. Many Americans continue to participate in Civil War battle re-enactments, wearing uniforms from both sides in an effort to preserve U.S. history."},

The two-page order from U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon signals that she's inclined to grant a request from Trump's lawyers, who this week asked for the appointment of an independent special master to review the records taken from Mar-a-Lago and identify any that may be protected by executive privilege. The judge scheduled a Thursday hearing to discuss the matter further. A special master is often a former judge. Cannon also directed the Justice Department to file under seal with her more detailed descriptions of the material taken from Trump's property. The former president's lawyers have complained that investigators did not disclose enough information to them about what specific documents were removed when agents executed a search warrant on Aug. 8 to look for classified documents. The special master appointment, if it happens, is unlikely to significantly affect the direction of the Justice Department investigation, though it's possible an outside review of the documents could slow the probe down."},

A few states quickly followed through. Idaho sold $300,000 of bonds in a Russian oil company in early March. A day before the invasion, the Kentucky Teachers Retirement System sold its shares in the Russian bank Sberbank. But those examples are outliers. Six months into a war that has killed thousands of Ukrainians and displaced over 12 million more, most of the pledges to drop Russian investments \u2014 some made with great fanfare during news conferences \u2014 have gone unfulfilled, according to an Associated Press review, state retirement administrators and firms that invest state funds. Swift global reaction has cut off much of Russia's economy from the rest of the world. That has made it nearly impossible for divestment by state pension funds, university endowments and other public-sector holdings \u2014 as well as private investments such as those in 401(k) accounts. \"These pension funds want to get out, but it's just not realistic to sell everything in the current environment,\" said Keith Brainard, research director at the National Association of State Retirement Administrators. Benjamin Smith, a spokesperson for the Rhode Island treasury, said the factors that make it hard to divest also show that a worldwide effort to isolate Russian President Vladimir Putin is working. \"This is good news because it means that pressure from investors across the world, including Rhode Island, is succeeding in exacting a toll on the Russian economy, making it more difficult for Putin to fund his military operation, state-owned companies, and corrupt network of oligarchs,\" he said in an email, noting that Rhode Island's pension plan exposure in Russia never exceeded 0.3% of its assets. Any pre-war investments in Russia are now worthless, or nearly so. That's raising questions from some officials and fund managers about whether divesting is even necessary. In Hawaii, one of a handful of states where top administration officials did not pledge to divest, Gov. David Ige said at a May 5 news conference that the state's employee pension system had \"very little to almost nothing\" invested in Russia. \"The few remaining investments are quite small, and so I didn't feel compelled to just make a statement for political reasons that we would be divesting,\" he said. Before Russia's invasion in late February, many government-controlled investments had only small holdings \u2014 a fraction of 1% in every reported case \u2014 in Russian investments. But even that could amount to millions of dollars. The largest U.S. public-sector retirement fund, California's CalPERS, said just 17 cents of every $100 of its portfolio was in Russian investments as the war broke out. Even so, that translated into $765 million worth of stocks, real estate and private equity. By the end of June, the value had shrunk to $194 million. The entire loss was because the holdings dropped in value; none had been sold. There is no way to know how much state government entities in the U.S. have invested in Russia or companies based there, but collectively they were worth billions of dollars before the war. Much of the money was invested in Russian government bonds, oil and coal companies as part of emerging-markets index funds. Quick to condemn the invasion, state officials said they could put pressure on Putin by dumping their Russian investments. \"Our moral imperative before these atrocities demand that you act to address Russia's aggressions and immediately restrict Russian access to California's capital and investments,\" California Gov. Gavin Newsom wrote in a letter on Feb. 28 to the boards overseeing the massive pension funds that serve teachers, state and local government workers and university employees. Across the country, governors and other top officials made similar statements. Just after the invasion began, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul signed an executive order calling for divestment \"to the extent possible,\" while Arizona's Board of Regents voted to exit any Russian investments. The treasurers for 36 states plus the District of Columbia and U.S. Virgin Islands signed a joint letter in March advocating divestment of publicly controlled funds from Russia. They noted a financial reason for doing so: \"The current crisis also constitutes a substantial risk for states' investments and our economic security.\" A major chunk of the government holdings in Russia is in the form of index funds that investors use to mimic overall stock market performance. Russian stocks were commonly part of funds specializing in emerging markets. MCSI and other firms that decide which stocks should be in the funds quickly dropped Russian securities. But the companies that sell investment products based on those indexes were left in the lurch, still leaving pieces of Russian stocks in their investors' portfolios. As part of the sanctions, stock markets in the U.S. and elsewhere stopped the trading of Russian stocks. And the Moscow Stock Exchange was closed for nearly a month, reopening with tight controls that keep U.S. investors from selling. The assets sank in value amid the invasion, though the precise value isn't always clear. Maryland said that as of the beginning of February, $197 million of its state retirement and pension system funds were invested in Russian assets. A month later, the state estimated the value had plunged and amounted to just $32 million. The state has been unable to unload its investments. For the handful of states in which top officials have not endorsed divestment, eroding values like that are the main reason. Shortly after the invasion, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said the number of state investments in Russia was \"minuscule\" and noted that the value was about to \"shrink to almost nothing as the Russian economy is being virtually shut off from the world.\" In Florida, Lamar Taylor, the interim executive director of the agency that oversees investments of pension funds, said during a cabinet meeting that some investment managers might seek to unload Russian assets as soon as they're able, while others could hold on in case they're worth more later. At the meeting, Gov. Ron DeSantis said the State Board of Administration has a legal responsibility to try to make money for the retirement system. \"That would violate your fiduciary duty, if you liquidated at massive losses for political reasons rather than for the best interests of the beneficiaries,\" he said. But DeSantis said there was a way to make it easier: Lawmakers passing a bill banning investment in Russia. \"If the Legislature could speak clearly, that would be something we'd welcome here, just to make sure we're not furthering investments in parts of the world that are not reflective of our interests or values,\" he said. Hank Kim, executive director of the National Conference on Public Employee Retirement Systems, said he has told member pension funds that taking steps to divest is important even if it can't be completed right away. \"The public has a right to know that it was debated in a serious manner,\" he said."},

The \"limited set\" of potentially privileged information was identified by a team that is kept separate from the investigative squad that searched Trump's Palm Beach, Florida, residence earlier this month, DOJ officials said in a court filing in U.S. District Court in southern Florida on Monday morning. The so-called privilege review team \"completed its review of those materials\" and is following a process to \"address potential privilege disputes, if any,\" according to that filing. Attorney-client privilege often refers to the legal doctrine that protects the confidentiality of communications between an attorney and their client. The DOJ's filing provided no details about the potentially privileged materials. The agency disclosed the privilege team's review one week after Trump sued to block the DOJ from further investigating any materials taken in the raid until a court-appointed \"special master\" is able to analyze them. Judge Aileen Cannon, who was appointed by Trump, gave notice Saturday of her \"preliminary intent to appoint a special master\" in the case. Cannon ordered the government to publicly respond to Trump by Tuesday. She also ordered the DOJ to submit a sealed filing that provides more details about the seized materials, and she set a hearing for Thursday at 1 p.m. ET in a West Palm Beach courthouse. In response, top DOJ counterintelligence official Jay Bratt assured the judge that the government will comply with those orders. But \"the government notes that, before the Court issued its Preliminary Order, and in accordance with the judicially authorized search warrant's provisions, the Privilege Review Team ... identified a limited set of materials that potentially contain attorney-client privileged information\" and \"completed its review of those materials,\" Bratt wrote. The DOJ and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, or ODNI, \"are currently facilitating a classification review of materials recovered\" from Trump's residence, Bratt added. The ODNI \"is also leading an intelligence community assessment of the potential risk to national security that would result from the disclosure of these materials,\" he wrote. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre declined to answer reporters' specific questions about the DOJ probe later Monday, stressing that the agency is conducting its investigation independently and \"we have not been involved.\" She noted, however, neither President Joe Biden nor anyone else at the White House has been briefed on the matter, but declined to comment on any classified materials prepared for the president. Trump's civil lawsuit is being overseen by a different judge than the one who approved the search warrant for Mar-a-Lago. The affidavit for that search warrant \u2014 in which an FBI agent explained why the government had probable cause to believe the search would turn up evidence of illegality \u2014 was released Friday, albeit with heavy redactions. The National Archives and Records Administration retrieved 15 boxes of records from Mar-a-Lago in January. The next month, NARA sent a referral to the DOJ that the records contained \"highly classified documents intermingled with other records,\" according to the affidavit. By law, presidential records must be turned over to the National Archives when a president departs office. The FBI launched a criminal investigation and found that the 15 boxes included 184 specific documents marked classified, 67 of which were marked \"confidential,\" 92 marked \"secret\" and 25 marked \"top secret,\" according to the affidavit. The search warrant was revealed days after the FBI entered Mar-a-Lago in August. It indicated that FBI agents were looking for materials showing violations of laws against obstruction of justice and the removal of official records, as well as the U.S. Espionage Act. The FBI took at least 20 boxes of items in the August raid, including numerous sets of highly classified documents, according to a property receipt that was also made public by the DOJ."},

The former TV personality's vocal support for the energy business follows years of industry donations to his nonprofit and then his campaign, according to financial records reviewed by CNBC. Oz also has a personal stake in oil and gas through investments in two major energy companies, according to his financial disclosures. Pennsylvania's next senator will be a key vote for the energy industry, as it has a major presence in the Keystone State. Pennsylvania is the nation's second-largest natural gas producer after Texas and the third-largest coal producer, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Oz backed the energy industry this year as Americans felt the strain from spiking gas prices. In a recent interview, he ripped President Joe Biden after he called on companies that run gas stations to bring down prices at the pump. \"Now, they're blaming the energy companies for the gas prices. And I'm thinking, like most Americans, what are you talking about? I mean, you did things that make it, make it impossible for these companies to exist,\" Oz said in a July interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity. He called Biden's comments \"class warfare.\" As Oz champions oil and gas in his bid to represent Pennsylvania in the Senate, both his campaign and personal coffers have benefited from the industry and its executives. Oz, a veteran physician and television host, is running against Democrat John Fetterman for a Senate seat being vacated by Republican Sen. Pat Toomey. Oz is trailing Fetterman by just under 8 percentage points in an average of recent polls, according to RealClearPolitics. Fetterman's campaign has raised over $25 million, while Oz and his team have brought in just over $18 million, according to data from the nonpartisan OpenSecrets. Oz and his wife, Lisa, have a financial stake in the industry he has championed, as they own shares of oil and gas giants ConocoPhillips and Pioneer Natural Resources, according to their financial disclosure report. The filing notes they own shares of ConocoPhillips valued between $15,001 and $50,000 and Pioneer stock valued between $1,001 and $15,000. Oz's connections to the industry formed before he pursued politics. His nonprofit HealthCorps, which promotes itself as a group aiming to help teens with their health and wellness, has seen at least $210,000 in contributions from gas and oil producer Continental Resources since 2016, according to the group's annual financial reports. Continental's support has continued into Oz's Senate bid: The company's founder and chair, Harold Hamm, endorsed Oz for Senate in an April campaign video. The backing from energy industry leaders has led to contributions to Oz's campaign. Hamm is among a group of over a dozen oil and gas industry leaders who have combined to contribute over $200,000 to Oz's campaign since he announced his run for Senate late last year, according to a CNBC review of Federal Election Commission filings. Others with ties to the oil and gas business who have donated at least $2,900 to Oz's campaign include Jimmy Haslam, an owner of the Cleveland Browns and chair of Pilot Company, a business that owns fueling stations across the country. His father and Pilot founder, James Haslam II, also donated to the Oz campaign. Other top energy donors in recent months include Brad Cox, the chair of oil producer Cox Operating, and Janet Cafaro, the president of Silcor Oilfield Services, FEC records show. Jimmy Haslam and his wife, Susan \"Dee\" Haslam, combined to give $50,000 to the pro-Oz super PAC American Leadership Action. Jimmy and Dee Haslam told CNBC in a statement that they have \"tremendous respect for the long, successful career Dr. Oz has had in the private sector and appreciate that he now wants to serve his country by bringing his expertise and experience to the United States Senate.\" The Haslam family, as of 2015, had a net worth of $6 billion, according to Forbes. Representatives for Cox and Cafaro did not return requests for comment. Hamm told CNBC in a statement that he considers Oz a \"friend.\" He said the two have known each other for almost a decade, with the goal of bringing HealthCorps' services into Oklahoma schools. Hamm explained that he believes Oz will be a key advocate for the energy sector, which has enriched the oil billionaire. He and his family have a net worth of at least $21 billion, according to Forbes. \"Dr. Oz will champion American energy in the U.S. Senate much like he's championed health his entire career,\" Hamm said. The nonprofit's annual reports from 2016 through 2020 give a range of how much donors contributed to HealthCorps. Continental Resources regularly ranked among the Oz group's top backers. The company is often listed as donating between $50,000 and $99,999 during those years. A HealthCorps filing says it received a range of $10,000 to just under $25,000 from Continental in 2018. In its earlier filings before 2016, HealthCorps lists Continental as either a \"national\" or a \"community\" sponsor. The group's website notes that its national sponsors contribute $1 million and its community donors write checks for $250,000. The disclosures pre-2016 do not say or show a range of how much the company gave those years. Oz's support from the massive energy industry coincides with an apparent shift in his opinion on fracking, which allows companies to drill deep into the earth for oil and gas resources. Critics say that fracking hurts the environment by harming water supplies and polluting the air. Before Oz ran for Senate, he repeatedly wrote columns that took aim at fracking, noting its potential threat to public health, Vice reports. \"And in Pennsylvania, there are multiple reports of air and water contamination, possibly from hydraulic fracturing sites, causing folks breathing problems, rashes, headaches, nosebleeds, numbness, nausea and vomiting,\" Oz said in a 2014 column critical of fracking. Brittany Yanick, a spokeswoman for the Oz campaign, said the candidate has not changed his view on fracking and is a strong supporter of the drilling method. She also took aim at Fetterman's position on the issue. \"As a scientist, Dr. Oz understands that, like with COVID, the Biden administration is ignoring the science and the benefits of natural gas in order to satisfy the radical Left, the same liberal Democrats that are supporting radical environmental measures and funding John Fetterman's campaign,\" Yanick said in an emailed statement. \"John Fetterman has called fracking a 'stain' on Pennsylvania, he's called for a moratorium on fracking, and he would be a rubber stamp for the failing Biden Agenda.\" Fetterman has a mixed history with where he stands on fracking. Inside Climate News reported that Fetterman dropped his support for a fracking moratorium after his failed 2016 primary run for Senate. His position evolved after the state moved toward stricter regulations on fracking. Emilia Rowland, a spokeswoman for Fetterman's campaign, told CNBC that \"John does not support a ban on fracking in Pennsylvania and that includes a moratorium on new fracking sites.\" She said he hasn't taken any campaign money from the fossil fuel industry. \"John believes fully heartedly that we have to preserve the union way of life for the thousands of workers currently employed by the natural gas industry in Pennsylvania and the communities where they live. We can't just abandon these people, and tell them to go learn how to code,\" Rowland said in a statement. \"It's a total false choice that we have to choose between jobs and a clean environment. That's just not true. We can have both.\" Still, Oz appears more vocal than Fetterman in publicly supporting the oil and gas industry. In a recent op-ed, he said it's \"gross, and deeply unpatriotic\" for oil companies to charge high gas prices while their businesses are making massive profits. Fetterman namechecked Chevron, Exxon and Shell in the op-ed. Oz has rubbed elbows with industry officials during his campaign. He was invited to a June \"energy industry meet and greet\" by longtime lobbyist Missy Edwards. The invite says the meeting was set to take place at Edwards' offices in Washington. Her current clients include Southern Company and General Motors, OpenSecrets says. A spokeswoman for General Motors said she was \"not sure if GM had a representative in attendance.\" Edwards and a representative for Southern Company did not return requests for comment."},

The Justice Department argued in a court filing that Trump lacks the legal standing to appoint a special master. Appointing that watchdog could harm national security, the agency warned. The department also said it has evidence that government records likely were concealed and removed from a storage room at Trump's home at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, \"and that efforts were likely taken to obstruct the government's investigation.\" Trump had sued to block the Justice Department from further investigating any materials taken in the raid until a court-appointed special master is able to analyze them. That step is typically taken when there is a chance that some evidence should be withheld from prosecutors because of various legal privileges. \"As an initial matter, the former President lacks standing to seek judicial relief or oversight as to Presidential records because those records do not belong to him,\" the DOJ wrote to Judge Aileen Cannon in U.S. District Court in southern Florida. Cannon, who was appointed by Trump, has set a hearing for Thursday at 1 p.m. ET in a West Palm Beach courthouse. Trump's legal team has until Wednesday night to reply to the DOJ's latest submission. The DOJ is conducting a criminal investigation of the removal of White House documents and their shipment to Trump's residence at Mar-a-Lago when he left office. By law, presidential records must be turned over to the National Archives and Records Administration when a president departs office. The National Archives and Records Administration retrieved 15 boxes of records from Mar-a-Lago in January. The next month, NARA sent a referral to the DOJ that the records contained \"highly classified documents intermingled with other records,\" according to the affidavit used to obtain the warrant for the Aug. 8 search of Trump's home. The DOJ said in Tuesday night's filing that the FBI had \"uncovered multiple sources of evidence indicating ... that classified documents remained\" at Mar-a-Lago. \"The government also developed evidence that government records were likely concealed and removed from the Storage Room and that efforts were likely taken to obstruct the government's investigation,\" the DOJ wrote. That evidence contradicted a sworn certification letter on June 3 from the custodian of Trump's records, claiming that \"any and all\" documents responsive to a grand jury subpoena had been handed over, the DOJ wrote. The August search \"cast serious doubt on the claim in the certification ... that there had been 'a diligent search' for records responsive to the grand jury subpoena,\" according to the DOJ's filing. Of the evidence taken in that raid, \"over one hundred unique documents with classification markings \u2014 that is, more than twice the amount produced on June 3, 2022, in response to the grand jury subpoena \u2014 were seized,\" the DOJ wrote. \"That the FBI, in a matter of hours, recovered twice as many documents with classification markings as the 'diligent search' that the former President's counsel and other representatives had weeks to perform calls into serious question the representations made in the June 3 certification and casts doubt on the extent of cooperation in this matter,\" the DOJ wrote. The prosecutors also argued against the appointment of a special master, saying it is \"unnecessary\" and that doing so \"would significantly harm important governmental interests, including national security interests.\" That harm could include impeding the intelligence community's \"ongoing review of the national security risk\" that may have been caused by \"improper storage of these highly sensitive materials,\" the DOJ argued. The prosecutors concluded that Cannon should reject Trump's requests \"and decline to require the return of seized items, enjoin further review of seized materials, or appoint a special master.\" Tuesday's filing came one day after the DOJ told Cannon that its review of the seized materials was complete. The DOJ told the court on Monday that a law enforcement team had identified a \"limited set\" of materials that may be protected by attorney-client privilege. That privilege often refers to the legal doctrine that protects the confidentiality of communications between an attorney and their client. The so-called privilege review team \u2014 which is separate from the investigation that led the FBI to search Trump's residence earlier this month \u2014 is following a process to \"address potential privilege disputes, if any,\" the DOJ wrote. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence \"is also leading an intelligence community assessment of the potential risk to national security that would result from the disclosure of these materials,\" according to the filing. Before the DOJ posted its late-night response, a group of former government officials asked the judge to let them file a brief as \"amici curiae\" \u2014 Latin for \"friends of the court\" \u2014 arguing against Trump's requests. The group included six former federal prosecutors who served in Republican administrations, as well as former New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, who governed as a Republican but backed President Joe Biden over Trump in 2020."},

Ron DeSantis in Florida ", "tag": "Politics", "author": "Kevin Breuninger", "datetime": "2022-08-31 16:22:20", "paragraphs": " Democratic Rep. Charlie Crist announced Wednesday he will resign from Congress as he campaigns to unseat Florida's Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in November. The move will shrink Democrats' already-slim majority in the House, potentially complicating efforts to pass more legislation before the midterm elections when Republicans are currently favored to take control. Serving in Congress \"has been an honor and a privilege,\" Crist said in a statement, which did not mention his campaign for governor. \"From the bottom of my heart, thank you for trusting me as your Representative in Washington.\" Crist will step down by the close of business Wednesday, he said in the statement. Congressional staff for Crist's district will provide casework and constituent services until the next representatives are sworn in in January, the statement said. Florida's 13th Congressional District, where Crist has served since 2017, is considered a likely pickup for Republicans this November, according to the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. The district's political makeup shifted toward the GOP after a new congressional map, proposed by DeSantis, re-shaped the area. Crist handily won the Democratic nomination for Florida's gubernatorial race. But polls show him trailing DeSantis, a dominant figure in the GOP who is widely rumored to be gearing up for a 2024 presidential run. DeSantis has also far outraised Crist: The powerful Republican incumbent governor's campaign has raised more than $165 million since 2019, OpenSecrets reported earlier this month. DeSantis' stature in the party is exceeded perhaps only by former President Donald Trump, who has regularly teased the possibility of launching another White House bid. Crist's move mirrors DeSantis' decision in 2018 to resign from Congress as he campaigned for governor in a hotly contested race against Democrat Andrew Gillum. DeSantis at the time said that he did not want to be criticized for taking a U.S. representative's paycheck while missing votes."},

John Eastman also invoked protections under attorney-client privilege in refusing to answer at least some questions he was asked before the grand jury, which was convened as part of a criminal probe into the possibility of illegal interference in Georgia's presidential election contest, his attorneys said. Eastman is one of a group of Trump allies who were subpoenaed by that panel, which is hearing testimony in Atlanta. A second ally, Trump's former personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, has been named a target in that investigation and recently testified before the same grand jury. Eastman wrote a series of memos after the 2020 election calling on then-Vice President Mike Pence to effectively undo President Joe Biden 's win by refusing to certify the Electoral College results. \"In his appearance before the Fulton County Special Grand Jury, we advised our client John Eastman to assert attorney-client privilege and the constitutional right to remain silent where appropriate,\" Eastman's lawyers, Charles Burnham and Harvey Silverglate, said in a statement. \"Out of respect for grand jury secrecy we will not disclose the substance of the questions or testimony. We wish to thank the grand jurors for their service,\" the attorneys said. The statement also blasted Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis for the probe itself. \"By all indications, the District Attorney's Office has set itself on an unprecedented path of criminalizing controversial or disfavored legal theories, possibly in hopes that the federal government will follow its lead,\" the lawyers said. \"Criminalization of unpopular legal theories is against every American tradition and would have ended the careers of John Adams, Ruth Ginsburg, Thurgood Marshall and many other now-celebrated American lawyers,\" the statement said. Adams was the second president of the United States, while Ginsburg and Marshall were Supreme Court justices who helped establish new legal precedents with their work during the civil rights movement. \"We ask all interested observers of any political persuasion to join us in decrying this troubling development,\" Burnham and Silverglate wrote. Eastman last month revealed that his cellphone was seized by federal agents who stopped him in New Mexico and forced him to unlock it. That seizure was done as part of an investigation by the Justice Department's internal watchdog, the Office of the Inspector General. The IG's office is probing the role of the Justice Department and its components in \"preparing for and responding to\" the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters, according to the office's website. That riot occurred as a joint session of Congress was convened to certify Biden's victory, with Pence presiding over the proceedings. A former Justice Department official, Jeffrey Clark, had electronics seized from his Virginia home on the same day that Eastman's phone was seized. Clark also backed Trump's effort to overturn the election. Trump considered installing Clark as attorney general in the days leading up to Jan. 6, 2021, but dropped the idea after a group of top Justice officials said they would resign in protest if that happened."},

The narrowly focused filing in U.S. District Court in West Palm Beach came one day after the Department of Justice argued that appointing a special master could harm the government's national security interests. The DOJ's filing also said that \"efforts were likely taken to obstruct the government's investigation\" into the records that had been shipped to Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence after the end of his presidency. And the DOJ revealed that the FBI seized more than 100 classified documents from the Palm Beach resort during its search of the premises earlier this month. The agency also shared a redacted FBI photo showing documents with classification markings that had been recovered from a container in Trump's \"45 Office.\" Trump's legal team in its Wednesday night reply accused the DOJ of twisting \"the framework of responding to a motion for a Special Master into an all-encompassing challenge to any judicial consideration, presently or in the future, of any aspect of its unprecedented behavior in this investigation.\" The government's \"extraordinary document\" suggests \"that the DOJ, and the DOJ alone, should be entrusted with the responsibility of evaluating its unjustified pursuit of criminalizing a former President's possession of personal and Presidential records in a secure setting,\" Trump's lawyers wrote. They also accused the DOJ of providing multiple \"misleading or incomplete statement[s] of purported 'fact,'\" but offered few specifics. Judge Aileen Cannon, who was appointed by Trump, has set a hearing for Thursday at 1 p.m. ET in a West Palm Beach courthouse. Trump had sued to block the Justice Department from further investigating any materials taken in the Mar-a-Lago raid until a special master is able to analyze them. That step is typically taken when there is a chance that some evidence should be withheld from prosecutors because of various legal privileges. The DOJ told the judge on Monday that its review of the seized materials was complete, and that a law enforcement team had identified a \"limited set\" of materials that may be protected by attorney-client privilege. That privilege often refers to the legal doctrine that protects the confidentiality of communications between an attorney and their client. Trump's lawyers responded Wednesday that the so-called privilege review team was \"wholly deficient\" in identifying and separating all potentially privileged documents from the rest of the seized materials. Trump and his office have publicly claimed that he declassified all the documents that had been seized by the FBI. But Trump's legal team has not made that explicit argument in the civil lawsuit before Cannon. The DOJ in Tuesday's late-night filing said that when 15 boxes were retrieved from Mar-a-Lago by the National Archives in January, Trump \"never asserted executive privilege over any of the documents nor claimed that any of the documents in the boxes containing classification markings had been declassified.\" The government also said that no claims about declassification were made when FBI agents went to Mar-a-Lago on June 3, pursuant to a grand jury subpoena to collect any more records in Trump's possession that bore classification markings. The DOJ said it obtained that subpoena in May, after the FBI developed evidence that dozens of boxes with classified information \u2014 beyond the 15 boxes retrieved in January \u2014 were still at Trump's residence. \"When producing the documents, neither counsel nor the custodian asserted that the former President had declassified the documents or asserted any claim of executive privilege. Instead, counsel handled them in a manner that suggested counsel believed that the documents were classified: the production included a single Redweld envelope, double-wrapped in tape, containing the documents,\" the DOJ wrote. At the same time, Trump's custodian of records had also provided a sworn certification letter, claiming that \"any and all\" documents responsive to a grand jury subpoena had been handed over, the DOJ wrote. But the FBI later \"uncovered multiple sources of evidence\" indicating that more classified documents remained at Mar-a-Lago, according to the DOJ's filing. \"The government also developed evidence that government records were likely concealed and removed from the Storage Room and that efforts were likely taken to obstruct the government's investigation,\" the DOJ wrote. That and other information led the government to seek a warrant to search Mar-a-Lago, which was ultimately carried out Aug. 8. In their reply on Wednesday, Trump's lawyers wrote that the DOJ's account of the June 3 meeting \"has been significantly mischaracterized.\" \"If the Government provided the same untrue account in the affidavit in support of the search warrant, then they misled the Magistrate Judge,\" the former president's lawyers wrote. Trump, in a social media post earlier Wednesday evening, also accused the DOJ of being \"very deceiving\" by sharing a photo that appears to show numerous classified papers strewn about on a carpeted floor. Trump clarified that the FBI \"took them out of cartons and spread them around on the carpet, making it look like a big 'find' for them.\" \"They dropped them, not me - Very deceiving...And remember, we could have NO representative, including lawyers, present during the Raid. They were told to wait outside,\" Trump wrote."},

Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and FBI agents along with NYPD detectives were seen carrying boxes during a search of 19 Duck Pond Lane in Southampton, N.Y., and the search of 515 Park Ave. in Manhattan. Records show those properties are linked to sanctioned Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg, a billionaire and close ally of President Vladimir Putin who heads the Moscow-based Renova Group, a conglomerate with interests in the metals, mining, and tech industries, according to U.S. Treasury Department documents. A search is also underway at a property on Miami's Fisher Island that authorities say was linked to Vekselberg, according to sources familiar with the matter. The U.S. seizure of Vekselberg's $900 million superyacht in early April marked the first under newly imposed Western sanctions targeting assets of Russian elites in response to the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine. Vekselberg is one of numerous Russian oligarchs to face sanctions since the start of the war. In addition to sanctions, Vekselberg has been the subject of a U.S. Department of Justice investigation into allegations of bank fraud. No charges have been filed in that case. All of Vekselberg's assets in the U.S. are frozen and American companies are barred from doing business with him and his entities. The Ukrainian-born businessman built his fortune by investing in the aluminum and oil industries in the post-Soviet era. Vekselberg has long had ties to the U.S., including a green card he once held and homes in New York and Connecticut. He was also questioned in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. A call to an attorney associated with the Hamptons property was not immediately returned Thursday. Attempts to reach a representative for Vekselberg were not immediately successful. HSI and FBI confirmed their agents were at those locations but declined further comment. The U.S. Department of Justice and NYPD declined immediate comment.

But details of how many of those records the Mazars USA accounting firm will turn over were not included in a committee statement announcing the agreement Thursday. The deal does not cover a separate lawsuit involving the House Ways and Means Committee, which is seeking Trump's federal tax returns from 2015 through 2020. Last month, a federal appeals court said the Ways and Means Committee could get those returns. The agreement with the Oversight Committee came nearly two months after another panel of judges in the same appeals court in Washington, D.C., upheld a prior ruling that the Oversight Committee had the authority to subpoena certain of Trump's financial records from Mazars in furtherance of legislative purposes. However, the appeals court also told the committee to winnow the scope of the records it wanted to see. On Wednesday, Trump's lawyers told the court in a filing that in light of the settlement agreement with the Oversight Committee, he would drop a motion seeking a rehearing of the case, and a related one asking that the entire lineup of judges on the appeals court take up the issue. In a statement, committee Chairwoman Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., said, \"After facing years of delay tactics, the Committee has now reached an agreement with the former President and his accounting firm, Mazars USA, to obtain critical documents.\" \"These documents will inform the Committee's efforts to get to the bottom of former President Trump's egregious conduct and ensure that future presidents do not abuse their position of power for personal gain,\" Maloney said. The committee said that under the agreement, \"Mazars USA has agreed to comply with the court's order and produce responsive documents to the Committee as expeditiously as possible.\" A lawyer for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The committee sought the documents in 2019 as part of its investigation into Trump's conflicts of interest involving his businesses while serving as president and his foreign financial ties. The panel issued its subpoena to Mazars for Trump's records after his former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, testified to the Oversight Committee that Trump's financial statements had falsely represented his financial position. Trump then sued to block Mazars from surrendering the records. The case ended up before the Supreme Court, which in 2020 sent the lawsuit back to lower federal courts with the direction to apply a new standard for evaluating the merit of congressional subpoenas for a president's personal information."},

Lindsey Graham's latest effort to fully quash a subpoena for his testimony before a special grand jury in Georgia as part of its probe into possible criminal election interference by former President Donald Trump and his allies in 2020. But the judge also limited the scope of the subpoena by ordering that Graham, a South Carolina Republican and close Trump ally, cannot be asked about his \"investigatory fact-finding on telephone calls to Georgia election officials\" during his testimony. She was referring to phone calls Graham made to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and his staff in the weeks after the November 2020 election between Trump and President Joe Biden. Graham's lawyers have argued that those calls were \"quintessentially legislative factfinding\" by a sitting U.S. senator, and as such are protected by the speech and debate clause of the Constitution. That off-limits topic includes how the information he gathered \"related to his decision to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election,\" the judge ruled. \"The Court finds that this area of inquiry falls under the protection of the Speech or Debate Clause, which prohibits questions on legislative activity,\" Judge Leigh Martin May wrote in Thursday's order in U.S. District Court in Atlanta. But May rejected Graham's other arguments to either throw out the subpoena or sharply limit the questions that Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis' office can ask him. \"As to the other categories, the Court finds that they are not legislative, and the Speech or Debate Clause does not apply to them,\" May wrote. \"As such, Senator Graham may be questioned about any alleged efforts to encourage Secretary Raffensperger or others to throw out ballots or otherwise alter Georgia's election practices and procedures,\" the judge ordered. \"Likewise, the grand jury may inquire into Senator Graham's alleged communications and coordination with the Trump Campaign and its post-election efforts in Georgia, as well as into Senator Graham's public statements related to Georgia's 2020 elections,\" May wrote. Graham's challenge now goes back to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, where the senator filed an appeal after a previous ruling from Judge May denying his bid to quash the subpoena. \"We are pleased that the district court recognized that Senator Graham's testimony is protected by the Speech or Debate Clause,\" Graham's office said in a statement later Thursday. \"He will continue to defend the institutional interests of the Senate and the Constitution before the Eleventh Circuit.\" The order for Graham's testimony in Georgia's probe came one day after John Eastman, a pro-Trump lawyer who worked to overturn Biden's presidential victory, appeared before the grand jury and refused to answer questions. Eastman invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, as well as protections under attorney-client privilege, in refusing to answer at least some questions he was asked before the grand jury, his attorneys said. Rudy Giuliani, Trump's former personal attorney who was a leading voice challenging the 2020 election results, also recently testified before the grand jury."},

Schiff and Maloney said in a joint statement they were pleased the government was \"assessing the damage caused by the improper storage of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago.\" Politico reported the letter earlier. The Justice Department on Friday disclosed that it was investigating Trump for removing White House records because it believed he illegally held documents including some involving intelligence-gathering and clandestine human sources \u2014 among America's most closely held secrets. Haines said DNI \"will also lead an Intelligence Community (IC) assessment of the potential risk to national security that would result from the disclosure of the relevant documents\" including those seized. The Justice Department on Friday released a heavily redacted affidavit that underpinned the FBI's extraordinary search of Mar-a-Lago in which agents seized 11 sets of classified records including some labeled \"top secret\" as documents that could gravely threaten national security if exposed. In the affidavit, an unidentified FBI agent said the agency reviewed and identified 184 documents \"bearing classification markings\" containing \"national defense information\" after Trump in January returned 15 boxes of government records sought by the U.S. National Archives. Other records in those boxes, according to the affidavit, bore handwritten notes by Trump. Schiff and Maloney said the Justice Department release Friday \"affirms our grave concern that among the documents stored at Mar-a-Lago were those that could endanger human sources. It is critical that the IC move swiftly to assess and, if necessary, to mitigate the damage done.\" The search was part of a federal investigation into whether Trump illegally removed and kept documents when he left office in January 2021 after losing the 2020 election to President Joe Biden and whether Trump tried to obstruct the probe.

It was already known that the conservative advocate Ginni Thomas had contacted legislators in Arizona with a similar request seeking to undo Biden's victory there. The Washington Post first reported Thursday that she wrote two Republican legislators in Wisconsin, state Sen. Kathy Bernier and state Rep. Gary Tauchen, on Nov. 9, 2020, at \"virtually the same time the Arizona lawmakers received a verbatim copy of the message from Thomas.\" Bernier at the time was the chair of the state Senate elections committee. Thomas sent the emails days after Trump refused to concede the election to Biden, vowing, \"We'll be going to the U.S. Supreme Court.\" The subject lines of her messages read, \"Please do your Constitutional duty!\" \"Please stand strong in the face of media and political pressure,\" those emails said, according to The Post, which obtained them from the watchdog group Documented. \"Please reflect on the awesome authority granted to you by our Constitution. And then please take action to ensure that a clean slate of Electors is chosen for our state,\" Thomas wrote. Documented obtained the emails through a request under Wisconsin's public records laws. The group posted a copy of the emails online later Thursday. The report comes more than a month after Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., said the select House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, pro-Trump riot at the U.S. Capitol was considering issuing a subpoena to Ginni Thomas. Thomas sent the emails to Arizona and Wisconsin lawmakers via the online site FreeRoots, which provides pre-written messages that can be sent to multiple elected officials. Arizona and Wisconsin sent Biden electors to the Electoral College, as he won the popular vote in both states. The Electoral College then named him the winner of the 2020 vote. A lawyer for Thomas and a spokeswoman for the Supreme Court did not immediately respond to requests for comment from CNBC about her emails. Thomas' advocacy for conservative causes while her husband serves on the high court has generated controversy in recent years. Thomas sent 29 messages to Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows after the 2020 election encouraging him to pursue then-ongoing efforts to undo Biden's victory, CBS News reported in March. \"Help This Great President stand firm, Mark!!! ...You are the leader, with him, who is standing for America's constitutional governance at the precipice,\" she wrote Meadows on Nov. 10, 2020. \"The majority knows Biden and the Left is attempting the greatest Heist of our History.\" Several efforts to effectively overturn Trump's losses in battleground states ended up at the Supreme Court after the election. None of those efforts succeeded. In January, Clarence Thomas was the only Supreme Court justice to support Trump's request to block White House records from being sent to the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 riot. That riot began after Trump and his allies falsely claimed for weeks that he had actually won the presidential election and that Biden's victory was the result of widespread ballot fraud in states that included Arizona and Wisconsin. The violence disrupted a joint session of Congress for hours as lawmakers gathered to confirm Biden's Electoral College win."},

The president's remarks came after Idaho-based microchip manufacturer Micron announced plans Thursday to invest approximately $15 billion over the next decade in a new memory manufacturing facility in Boise. The lab, which is the first of its kind built in America in over 20 years, is projected to create 17,000 new American jobs by the end of 2032, according to the company. \"Today's announcement by Micron is another big win for America,\" Biden said in a statement. Micron President and CEO Sanjay Mehrotra thanked the Biden administration and members of Congress for bipartisan support of the CHIPS Act \"which made this investment decision possible.\" \"This is the first of Micron's multiple planned U.S. investments following the passage of the CHIPS and Science Act, and represents the largest private investment ever made in Idaho,\" Mehrotra said in a statement. \"Our new leading-edge memory manufacturing fab will fuel U.S. technology leadership, ensuring a reliable domestic supply of semiconductors that is critical to economic and national security.\" Over $52 billion was allotted to U.S. companies producing computer chips under the act, along with billions in tax credits to spur investments in semiconductor manufacturing to enable the U.S. to compete with East Asia. The region accounts for 75% of global production of semiconductors. Biden signed the CHIPS Act into law in early August. Micron first announced a $40 billion investment in memory chip manufacturing at that time. The investment, said the White House, will create 40,000 new jobs in construction and manufacturing and raise the U.S. market share of memory chip production from less than 2% to up to 10% over the next 10 years. In his statement Thursday, Biden also mentioned similar growth projections from manufacturing companies First Solar, Toyota, Honda and Corning over the past week. The announcements are a \"direct result of my economic plan,\" he said. Solar power company First Solar announced $1.2 billion in developments Tuesday, including a new factory in the southeastern part of the country and an expansion of its Northwest Ohio manufacturing footprint. The investments will add at least 850 new manufacturing jobs with the additional goal of supporting over 15,000 jobs by 2025, according to a press release. Vehicle manufacturers Toyota and Honda revealed a respective $2.5 billion additional investment in Toyota's North American battery manufacturing facility and a $4.4 billion joint venture with LG Energy Solutions to manufacture lithium-ion batteries in the U.S. that will power Honda and Acura EV models for the domestic market. Toyota's new venture will add 350 jobs, bringing total employment to approximately 2,100, according to a statement. A representative for Honda did not respond to a request for comment before publication. Corning, a New York-based advanced optics manufacturer, said Tuesday it is partnering with AT&T in a new optical cable manufacturing facility in Arizona. The facility will bring approximately 250 jobs to the area and is expected to open in 2024, according to a press release. \"In our future, we will make EVs, chips, fiber optics, and other critical components here in America, and we will have an economy built from the bottom up and middle out,\" Biden said Thursday. The economy has added 3.3 million jobs this year as the unemployment rate has fallen to 3.5%, tied for the lowest since 1969. For August, payrolls growth is expected to rise by 318,000 after growing by 528,000 in July. However, Federal Reserve officials have warned that their intentions to continue raising interest rates to combat inflation could raise the level of unemployment in the months ahead. \u2014 CNBC's Jeff Cox contributed to this article."},

Judge Aileen Cannon also will make public a status report by the investigation team probing the removal of documents from the White House when Trump left office in early 2021. But Cannon ended the hearing without ruling on a pending request by Trump to appoint an independent watchdog, known as a special master, who would review government documents seized by the FBI before the Department of Justice would be allowed to use the records to advance its probe. Cannon said she will rule later on that request, which Trump made in a lawsuit filed last month in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. Trump's lawyers had requested a more detailed list of documents taken from Mar-a-Lago than the less revealing inventory they have previously received from investigators. The DOJ is opposing the call for a special master, arguing that it will unjustifiably delay its criminal investigation. The Justice Department also has said that a review of the documents by a team of internal department watchdogs already has completed its own review and identified some records that would potentially be exempt from use in the investigation because they are protected by attorney-client privilege. In a separate ruling Thursday, Cannon said she will keep sealed a status report on that review by the DOJ's so-called filter team. Jay Bratt, the DOJ's top counterintelligence official, also argued at the hearing that Trump is not entitled to a review of the documents by a special master because \"he is no longer the president.\" \"And because he's no longer the president, he had no right to those documents ... that ends the analysis,\" Bratt said. Special masters, often drawn from the ranks of retired judges, are typically appointed in cases where there is a risk that some of the records seized by law enforcement should be barred from use in an investigation because they are protected by attorney-client privilege. Trump's lawyers, however, argue that some of the records could be protected by executive privilege that would result from him having been president at the time they were created. In a court filing Tuesday, the DOJ revealed that more than 100 classified documents were found at Mar-a-Lago, the private club in Palm Beach, Florida, where Trump maintains a residence, during the Aug. 8 raid. That discovery came two months after Trump's lawyers, in response to a federal grand jury subpoena, provided the DOJ with a sworn certification that a search of Trump's living quarters and office had not found records that were marked classified. Tuesday's filing said there is evidence that government records including the ones marked classified were likely concealed and removed from a storage room at that residence in an effort to \"obstruct the government's investigation.\" Authorities have said the National Archives and Records Administration tried for about a year after Trump left the White House in January 2021 to obtain documents it suspected were still in his possession. When Trump did give up 15 boxes of records from Mar-a-Lago earlier this year, they were found to contain highly classified material, leading to the opening of the DOJ probe, and eventually the Aug. 8 raid. Trump has argued that he declassified the records before leaving office. But whether or not the documents remain classified is irrelevant under the criminal laws that the DOJ is eyeing in the case, which include the espionage statute and obstruction of justice. By law, White House records must be turned over to NARA when a president leaves office. During Thursday's hearing, Trump lawyer Jim Trusty repeated an analogy that has become popular among defenders of the former president on the records issue. \"We've characterized it at times as an overdue library book scenario where there's a dispute \u2014 not even a dispute \u2014 but ongoing negotiations with [the National Archives] that has suddenly been transformed into a criminal investigation,\" Trusty said, according to NBC News. Trusty's claim omitted mention of a grand jury subpoena issued for the documents."},

Agents found 43 of those empty folders marked classified in Trump's office, according to the Department of Justice's inventory of the seized items, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The remaining five empty folders with that marking were found in containers in a storage room. The FBI also found another 42 empty folders marked \"Return to Staff Secretary/Miliary [sic] Aide,\" during the Aug. 8 raid, which was authorized to search for government documents removed from the White House when Trump left office in Jan. 2021, the filing said. Twenty-eight of those empty folders were found in Trump's office, while another 14 were in a storage room elsewhere, the document shows. And FBI agents found more than 10,000 government documents and photographs without classification markings, the filing shows. Among those were hundreds of photos and news articles, along with gifts, clothing, and books. The bombshell revelations raise the prospect that the DOJ has not yet recovered the documents that would have been in the empty folders. The DOJ is investigating possible crimes related to the removal of those and other government documents from the White House when Trump left office in Jan. 2021. By law, such records must be turned over to the National Archives and Records Administration. On Tuesday, the DOJ said in another court filing that more than 100 classified documents were found at Mar-a-Lago. That property receipt noted that the government seized 11 sets of classified documents, as well as an executive grant of clemency regarding Roger Stone, a longtime Republican operative and Trump confidant. The previously disclosed property inventory of items seized lists multiple U.S. government documents with \"confidential,\" \"secret\" and \"top secret\" classification markings. The detailed inventory made public Friday was one of two court filings related to the FBI raid that were ordered unsealed by Judge Aileen Cannon after she conducted a hearing Thursday on a request by Trump's lawyers to appoint a third-party to review the seized records. The other document unsealed Friday is titled, \"Notice of Investigative Team of Status of Review,\" and notes that the criminal probe did not end with the raid. It was signed by Miami U.S. Attorney Juan Gonzalez, and Jay Bratt, the chief of the counterintelligence and export control section of the national security division of the Justice Department. \"The seized materials will continue to be used to further the government's investigation, and the investigative team will continue to use and evaluate the seized materials as it takes further investigative steps, such as through additional interviews and grand jury practice,\" that notice says. \"It is important to note, 'review' of the seized materials is not a single investigative step but an ongoing process in this active criminal investigation,\" the document says. Trump's spokesman in a series of tweets about the inventory of the seized items again criticized the raid. \"The new 'detailed' inventory list only further proves that this unprecedented and unnecessary raid of President Trump's home was not some surgical, confined search and retrieval that the Biden administration claims, it was a SMASH AND GRAB,\" wrote the spokesman, Taylor Budowich. \"These document disputes should be resolved under the Presidential Records Act, which requires cooperation and negotiation by NARA [National Archives and Records Administration], not an armed FBI raid,\" Budowich added. Trump in a lawsuit filed in late August asked Cannon to appoint an independent watchdog, known as a special master, to review the items seized in the search before the DOJ is allowed to continue using the documents in the investigation. Trump's lawyers have said a special master could check to see if some documents would be prohibited from being used in the probe because they are protected by either attorney-client privilege or executive privilege. The DOJ has opposed the appointment of a special master, saying that it would delay the investigation, and that Trump does not own the documents. Cannon, during a court hearing in Florida on that dispute Thursday, said she will issue a ruling on the special master request in \"due course.\" Cannon, a Trump appointee, previously shared her \"preliminary intent\" to grant Trump's request for a special master. The judge suggested in Thursday's hearing that she is still considering that appointment, news outlets reported."},

Biden made one of the most influential policy decisions of his presidency Wednesday when he announced the cancellation of up to $10,000 in federal student loan debt for borrowers earning under $125,000 a year or $250,000 for married couples or heads of households. Pell Grant recipients can have up to $20,000 of debt canceled. The debt relief is capped at the amount of the borrower's outstanding debt, according to the Education Department. Some congressional Republicans immediately sought to undermine Biden's debt forgiveness plan. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., called it a \"radical agenda.\" \"Biden's debt transfer scam will make inflation even worse and does nothing to stop the runaway cost of college for most families,\" McCarthy posted on Twitter Wednesday. \"Americans cannot afford Democrats' radical agenda.\" Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene called the loan forgiveness policy \"unfair\" in an interview on conservative news network Newsmax TV. \"Taxpayers all over the country ... they shouldn't have to pay off the great, big student loan debt for some college student that piled up massive debt going to some Ivy League school,\" Greene said. The Georgia Republican added that Biden's debt forgiveness policy is a scheme to bring in Democratic votes during the November midterm elections. But public records show that Greene was the beneficiary of loan forgiveness in the early months of the pandemic. A Paycheck Protection Program loan of $182,200 given to Greene's company, Taylor Commercial Inc., in April 2020 was forgiven with accrued interest, according to records maintained by ProPublica. And wealthy Americans benefited from a nearly $2 trillion tax loophole after former President Donald Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act \u2014 passed by a Republican-controlled Congress \u2014 into law in 2017. Three-quarters of the benefit from the tax cuts outlined in the act would go to the top 1% of earners, per an analysis by the Tax Foundation. Biden's debt forgiveness policy is projected to cost the federal government around $244 billion, according to higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. Forgiveness for Pell Grant recipients will cost an additional $120 billion. The debt forgiveness plan also extends the pause on student loan debt repayments to Dec. 31, 2022. Over 40 million Americans owe $1.7 trillion in student loan debt."},

The White House's hope is that it will remain a winning strategy two months out from the midterm elections which will decide who controls the House of Representatives and Senate. The trip marks his second visit to the critical swing state of Pennsylvania in three days. \"For a long time, we've reassured ourselves that American democracy is guaranteed. But it is not,\" Biden said. \"We have to defend it. Protect it. Stand up for it. Each and every one of us. That's why tonight I'm asking our nation to come together and unite behind the single purpose of defending our democracy regardless of your ideology.\" Democrats' odds of keeping their majorities in both chambers of Congress have brightened in recent weeks despite the mixed economic signals, as Republicans continue to receive blowback from the Supreme Court's decision on abortion overturning Roe v. Wade and investigations into Trump persist. An NBC News poll released last week found a majority of American voters, 58%, disapprove of the Dobbs decision and nearly the same amount, 57%, believe the investigations into Trump should continue. \"MAGA forces are determined to take this country backwards,\" Biden said. \"Backwards to an America where there is no right to choose, no right to privacy, no right to contraception, no right to marry who you love.\" Since Trump entered office, Biden has said the country faces \"a battle for the soul of the nation.\" The significance of the threat to democracy is underscored by Biden's choice of venue: Independence National Historic Park where the Constitution was penned. The same NBC News poll found that \"threats to democracy\" has overtaken the cost of living as the most pressing issue on voters' minds. Biden has amped up his criticism of Republicans recently, seeking to position Democrats as an alternative to a party led by extremists. Last week he referred to Republicans as \"semi-fascist\" for staying loyal to the former president. His remarks come against the backdrop of Trump's legal woes following the FBI raid on his Florida home Mar-A-Lago where the former president is accused of mishandling classified information."},

So he requested two months off to backpack through Asia, he said, landing in Beijing in January 2019. \"On the first day \u2026 I meet this one,\" he said, gesturing to Darina Karpitskaya, sitting by his side. The couple, speaking to CNBC via video from Dubai, said they met via the travel app Couchsurfing, which links solo travelers together. Karpitskaya, 31, and a flight attendant at the time, had been grounded in Beijing for two days because of mechanical problems with her return flight. Though more solo travelers agreed to meet that day, Tyminas and Karpitskaya were the only two who showed up. After one day together, they planned to meet again in Asia one month later. Karpitskaya returned to Asia, and the couple's second date was a \"crazy one-month adventure\" to Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines, said Tyminas, 29. It was in the Philippines, he said, that he decided he wasn't going back to his old life. \"We were \u2026 laying on the beach under the stars,\" he said. \"We were kind of starting to dream about this lifestyle.\" After returning to Colorado, Tyminas quit his job, sold his belongings and moved to Europe, he said. Karpitskaya wasn't quite there yet, saying, \"At first it sounded like: Oh my God, you're quitting your job. You're moving from America. Maybe it's too soon. But at the same time, when I came back from that trip I felt like I'm living a life that I'm not enjoying.\" Tyminas flew from Denver to Paris with his dog \u2014 an 82-pound Borzoi, once known as the \"Russian Wolfhound,\" named Cosmo, who is over 6 feet tall on his hind legs. \"They gave me three rows of seats, and the dog was just laying on the floor,\" he said. From there, the couple traveled often \u2014 to places like Italy and Iceland \u2014 but not yet full time, they said. Then Karpitskaya got what she called her \"dream job\" \u2014 a position with Emirates airline. She moved to Dubai, but the couple continued to meet and travel together. Then Covid hit, and Karpitskaya accepted four months of unpaid leave from her job. \"We said: We have four months \u2014 we can go explore whatever is open,\" said Tyminas. The trio \u2014 including Cosmo, who traveled in a huge bed in the back of their SUV \u2014 traveled first to Croatia, then slowly across much of Europe, including many former Soviet states, said Karpitskaya. She never returned to her job, and couple have been traveling ever since, she said. In the beginning, they spent between $1,000 and $2,000 a month \u2014 all from savings \u2014 by staying in cheap accommodations, cooking at home and seeking out free activities, said Tyminas. As money started to dry up, Tyminas took several online jobs, which netted between $2,000 and $3,000 a month, which wasn't far from his salary of $3,300 in Colorado, he said. But the work was cumbersome, and it \"felt like I still had a job,\" he said. So the couple decided to open a marketing and graphic design company, despite the fact that \"we didn't know a lot,\" said Tyminas. They reached out to thousands of people, they said, often working late into the night. Potential customers would ask, \"Can you design book covers?\" \"Can you promote music?\" Tyminas said his response was always the same, \"Of course I can.\" In reality, he was learning on the job, he said, relying on YouTube, Google and online research. But clients were very happy, he said. \"They paid me half of what they would pay other marketing agencies and the results, they said, were better than they had before,\" said Tyminas. In the first month, the couple made $6,000, he said. Now, sometimes they earn several thousand dollars in a day working with real estate companies and music labels, he added. \"We write blogs for people \u2014 we do everything,\" said Tyminas. Plus \"we don't have to report to anybody. We're our own bosses.\" In the past six months, the couple said they spent an average of $4,000 a month. More than half goes to accommodations, which vary by location \u2014 from $3,100 per month in Dubai to $1,500 in Lisbon, Portugal, they said. They limit stays in expensive locations, like Switzerland, to no more than a week, they said. One way to save money is booking monthlong stays on Airbnb, which cuts down average nightly rates and reduces service and cleaning fees, said Tyminas. But even when they bounced from place to place to visit Europe's Christmas markets last year, they still ended up paying about $2,500 that month, he said. Karpitskaya said she doesn't want these costs to scare people because they spent far less in the beginning. At the time, they spent about 80-100% of their income, but now Tyminas said \"we spend about 30% and \u2026 save the rest.\" The couple told CNBC they still travel modestly \u2014 no five-star hotels \u2014 and they still cook most meals at home. But they spend more on activities that they film for their YouTube channel Dream Team Travels \u2014 another \"completely self-taught\" venture, they said. A life of constant travel isn't all fun and games, they said. They encounter dirty Airbnbs and hosts who cancel reservations at the last minute. They've also had their camera equipment and clothing stolen twice \u2014 once in Mexico, and more recently in France \u2014 plus an attempted theft of their belongings from their car in Barcelona, while they were sitting in it. They have also thought about settling down when they find a place they really love, such as the beaches of Portugal or the French Riviera, said Tyminas. \"But then \u2026 we drive somewhere else and we're like this place is also just as good,\" he said. When Russia invaded Ukraine, quickly occupying the Kherson region where Karpitskaya's parents live, Tyminas emailed CNBC to say that they'd stopped traveling for the time being. \"The first few weeks we didn't even leave our apartment,\" he said. \"We spent a lot of time arranging transportation for civilians as well as many dogs from shelters to be taken out of dangerous regions for adoption in Europe.\" By the summer, they had resumed traveling, but were still helping to evacuate Karpitskaya's family. \"Just a week ago we were able to finally get Darina's parents out of Ukraine,\" said Tyminas, adding that they are currently in his family's home in Lithuania. \"We also did a trip to Romania to pick up Darina's sister and her five-month-old baby from the border and took her to live in Germany.\" The couple are now in Malaysia, they said, and plan to explore Southeast Asia for the next two months."},

The world's biggest long-haul carrier will be retrofitting over 120 aircraft with new interiors, as well as dishing up menus with new vegan options and cinema snacks like popcorn, Emirates said in a statement.\nOther new perks for the carrier's first-class travelers include unlimited portions of Persian caviar, paired with Dom Perignon vintage champagne. Those investments come just as Emirates posted a $1.1 billion loss for the year ended March 31. \"While others respond to industry pressures with cost cuts, Emirates is flying against the grain and investing to deliver ever better experiences to our customers,\" said the president of Emirates airline, Tim Clark. Emirates is not the only airline pulling out all the stops to ride the tailwinds of \"revenge travel\" \u2014 the idea that people are making up for time \"lost\" during the pandemic to travel again. Earlier this year, Finnair launched a new line of premium economy cabins, featuring seats that provide around 50% more space than their economy seats. Air France, likewise, announced new long-haul business seats in May, complete with sliding dividers for passengers who want their own private space.\nEmirates told CNBC that it has seen \"a lot of interest\" in these luxury upgrades, though it said it does not have the full numbers yet. The upgrades come on the heels of an industry report predicting that business travel spending will return to pre-pandemic levels in 2026 rather than 2024, as previously forecast. Though spending by business travelers has been on the upswing, the Global Business Travel Association (GBTA) annual report stated that the 2021 figure was still less than half of the over $1.4 trillion that was generated by in business travel in 2019. One travel analytics company, however, noted a shift in demand toward premium seats. \"During the pandemic, we saw that the numbers of people travelling by air collapsed. However, the proportion of travelers flying in premium cabins increased significantly,\" Olivier Ponti of ForwardKeys told CNBC in an email.\nPonti said that before the pandemic, the split between premium and economy seats was a ratio of 13:87, compared with 17:83 in 2022.\n\"While there's no guarantee that the shift towards premium seats will be maintained as air travel recovers, one can understand why the airlines would want to invest in keeping hold of premium passengers, who, this year have typically spent 575% more on a seat than those flying economy.\" Others are skeptical, however. Edward Russell, an editor at Skift, a travel industry news site, told CNBC it's unclear how much of an effect \"small\" product changes will have on sales. \"Most travelers either fly the airline, or alliance, where they have loyalty, or opt for the cheapest fare. It is only a small subset of travelers who will actually book a flight based on the addition of a sliding door or unlimited caviar.\""},

But a new study suggests it may not be worth the time \u2014 at least in some places. The travel insurance comparison site InsureMyTrip compared rates for 950 hotels in 19 global cities on three popular booking websites as well as each hotel's site. According to the results published last week, Hotels.com had the best overall rates \u2014 but just barely. Hotels.com had the best rates in 620 instances, which was slightly higher than Expedia, which had the cheapest rates in 579 instances. Booking directly with a hotel was more expensive, but by only about $6 more on average, according to the study. \"There have been conflicting views on hotel rates, and people ... believe that booking through online travel platforms ensured a better rate than the hotel website,\" said Shalabh Arora, director of marketing at India's Four Seasons Hotel Bengaluru. \"However, it's not so at Four Seasons where rate parity is taken very seriously.\" He said the hotels' website has a pop-up function which compares rates offered by the hotel with those on other booking platforms. Finally, the website Booking.com had the cheapest rates in 72 instances \u2014 or about 7% of the time \u2014 according to the study. \"Not only was [Booking.com] rarely the most affordable, but it was also the most expensive option the majority of the time,\" according to the published results. The company's Managing Director for Asia Pacific Laura Houldsworth responded to the study by email, stating that the company aims \"to always be transparent with our customers\" and that \"our property partners are free to set their own prices on Booking.com.\" She added that \"our promise to price match also means that if a customer should ever find a lower price on another website, Booking.com will refund the difference.\" The report found average hotel rates on Hotels.com and Expedia were the same in seven of 19 cities, with overall averages varying by just 27 cents. \"Expedia and Hotels.com often had the same price, especially with the international hotels,\" said Sarah Webber, director of marketing for InsureMyTrip. Both brands are owned by Expedia Group, which also operates other travel booking websites, including Travelocity, Hotwire, Orbitz and CheapTickets. \"Hotels working with Expedia Group distribute their rates across all of our brands,\" said Anna Brown, a company public relations manager. \"The rate is similar across brands, however various offers ... approved by our hotel partners, sometimes create rate differences.\" Brown said rates can also vary through brands' app-only pricing, while Hotwire's \"Hot Rates\" mask hotels' names prior to purchase in exchange for deep discounts on last-minute bookings. Booking.com is part of Booking Holdings, which operates Priceline, Agoda and Kayak. Booking Holdings had the highest revenue among all online travel agencies from 2019 to 2021, according to the research company Statista. The InsureMyTrip report showed significant rate differences in certain cities. For instance, travelers could save as much as $88 per night in Honolulu, if they found the lowest price. In New York, the report found average hotel rates varied from $293 on Hotels.com to $367 on Booking.com. The study also found: But rate fluctuations were less pronounced outside of the United States. Posted rates varied less than $10 per night on average in Hong Kong, Bangkok, Macau, Kuala Lumpur and Istanbul, according to the research. InsureMyTrip's study represents a snapshot in time, with the research analyzing rates for a double room for two people booked for the night of Aug. 27, 2022, the firm said. All searches were conducted on the same day to avoid price fluctuations, since \"prices can change quickly and without warning,\" said Webber. However, the study did not consider whether rates were refundable or included taxes, said Webber. \"To keep the study as simple as possible, we took the price seen on the sites as the final cost,\" she said. \"So, it's definitely something to consider as not all hotels or booking sites include the same extras in the final price.\" Other factors, such as prepayment requirements and breakfast inclusions, can affect rates too, which further complicates the hotel price comparison process \u2014 for researchers and travelers alike."},

The employees, who spoke with CNBC on the condition of anonymity, said since they have been asked to return to offices, infections notifications pop up in their email inboxes regularly. Employees are reacting with frustration and memes. The company began requiring most employees to return to physical offices at least three days a week in April. Since then, staffers have pushed back on the mandate after they worked efficiently for so long at home while the company enjoyed some of its fastest revenue growth in 15 years. Google has offered full-time employees the option to request permanent remote work, but it's unclear how many workers have been approved. Google\u2019s Covid-19 outbreak in Los Angeles is currently the largest of any employer in LA., according to the city\u2019s public health dashboard. Deadline.com first reported that the tech giant\u2019s trendy Silicon Beach campus in Venice, Calif., recorded 145 infections while 135 cases were recorded at the company\u2019s large Playa Vista campus. A spokesperson for Google told CNBC, \"There has not been a significant increase of onsite COVID-19 transmission on our campuses. The numbers that have been reported in Playa Vista and Venice reflect total cases over the last few months, not current or active cases.\" Staffers have been filling Memegen, an internal company image-sharing site, with memes about the increased number of exposure notifications they're receiving. One meme, which was upvoted 2,840 times, showed a photo of an inbox with the email subject from a San Francisco-based facilities manager stating \u201cWe\u2019re so excited to see you back in the office!\u201d and a subsequent email subject line stating \u201cNotification of Confirmed COVID-19 Case.\u201d Another meme with hundreds of upvotes said \u201cHow it started\u201d with an image of a rainbow arch followed by \u201cHow it\u2019s going\u201d and a wall of text saying \u201cNotification of confirmed Covid-19 case.\u201d Another featured an illustration of a happy Pokemon touring a Bay Area campus next to another photo of a worried Pokemon after getting a Covid-19 notification followed by an alarmed Pokemon with 29 exposure notifications. Another meme shows a picture of Star Wars character Rey, whose caption says \u201cI didn\u2019t know there was this much \u2018Notification of Confirmed COVID-19 Cases\u2019 in the whole galaxy.\u201d Some employees said they received a spike in notifications from the Mountain View, Calif. headquarters and in San Francisco offices after the company held a return-to-office celebration, where Grammy award-winning artist Lizzo performed for thousands of employees at the Shoreline Amphitheater, near Google's main campus. The spokesperson for Google also noted that the company follows methodology laid out by state and local laws in determining the definition of a Covid outbreak, and when to send exposure emails. Last December, Google told employees that they must comply with vaccine policies or they'd face losing pay and then losing their job. Then in February, ahead of asking employees to come back, it relaxed rules around vaccines being a requirement for employment, as well as other rules around testing, social distancing and masks. But it continued to require Covid-19 vaccination to enter physical offices. Now, some Google employees are asking the company to drop the vaccine mandate, arguing Covid-19 outbreaks keep happening anyway in the offices where employees are fully vaccinated. While it still provides a level of protection, the vaccines aren't as strong against the highly transmissible BA.5 variant, the fastest-spreading variant of Covid-19 to date, the group argues in a manifesto called \u201cNo Vaccine Mandate,\" which was posted this month and viewed by CNBC. (The vaccines are still providing good protection against severe disease and death, including with the BA.5 variant, but are not providing substantial protection against infection or mild illness.) The anonymous manifesto says the group, which calls itself Googlers for No Vaccine Mandate, is frustrated that non-vaccinated employees and those who decline to declare their vaccination status are still banned from offices and other gatherings including off-sites, summits and team events. It also claims that some Google employees still haven't met their teams since March 2020 and some were never notified of the vaccination policy during their hiring process. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen waves of Covid-particularly since December 2021 with Omicron and its sub variants spread through Google offices with little regard for vaccination status. We\u2019ve seen many fully vaccinated and boosted colleagues call out sick for multiple days with Covid. We\u2019ve seen both panics and good natured responses to the flood of exposure notifications received by officegoers.\" Other companies that once mandated Covid vaccination requirements have since dropped them, including Boeing, Intel, and United Airlines, citing a federal court\u2019s decision to prohibit enforcement of the federal contractor executive order that required vaccination of large employers that are also government contractors. The group's manifesto says it is hoping Google leadership does the same thing. The group is largely anonymous, although some members' identities are known to CNBC. It claims to include hundreds of employees with tenures of up to 10 years, in roles such as engineering, program management, UX design, education, sales, marketing and finance. It also includes Googlers who are fully vaccinated and \u201cbelieve the company\u2019s vaccine policy is an invasion of privacy and is insensitive to individual circumstances and risk factors.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re writing to ask for your help for a group of Googlers who still aren\u2019t allowed back to our offices,\" the memo states. \u201cWe are reaching out to you as colleagues and peers because our direct appeals to Google leadership have been ignored. When planning an in-person meeting, summit or offsite, think about how Googlers who are barred from full participation by the vaccine policy can be acknowledged and included.\""},

Although monkeypox cases are still increasing nationally, the speed of the outbreak appears to be slowing, Walensky said. The U.S. has reported nearly 17,000 monkeypox cases since May, more than any other country in the world, according to CDC data. In New York City, which has reported more infections than any other jurisdiction, new monkeypox cases have dropped from more than 70 per day on average to nine as of Thursday, according to data from the city health department. Dr. Aswhin Vasan, the city health commissioner, said earlier this week the outbreak has slowed due to increased vaccination and community outreach efforts. New York City has reported a total of 2,888 monkeypox cases. In Chicago, another major epicenter of the outbreak, new cases have dropped from 141 during the week ended July 30 to 74 for the week ended Aug. 20, according to that city's health department. Chicago has reported a total of 807 cases. \"We're not seeing the potentially exponential growth that we were seeing early on so that is reassuring,\" said Dr. Allison Arwady, Chicago's public health commissioner, during a Facebook live event earlier this week. \"Too early to say things look really good, but definitely some signs of slowing of cases.\" The U.S. is nearing the point where the entire community of gay and bisexual men who currently face the greatest health risk from monkeypox rwill have access to two doses of the monkeypox vaccine, according to Dawn O'Connell, head of the office responsible for the national stockpile at the Health and Human Services Department. The CDC previously estimated that up to 1.7 million gay and bisexual men who are HIV-positive or are eligible for medicine to reduce their chance of contracting HIV face the greatest health risk from monkeypox. The U.S. has distributed 1.5 million doses of the monkeypox vaccine so far and more than 3 million doses should be available by when the latest distribution round is complete, according to O'Connell. To date, the outbreak is disproportionately affecting Black and Hispanic men. About 30% of monkeypox patients are white, 32% are Hispanic and 33% are Black, according to CDC data. Whites make up about 59% of the U.S. population while Hispanics and Blacks account for 19% and 13%, respectively. The monkeypox vaccine, called Jynneos in the U.S., is administered in two doses 28 days apart. The patients will not have full protection from the vaccine until two weeks after the second dose is administered, according to the CDC. Data from 19 jurisdictions show that nearly 97% of the shots administered so far were first doses, according to Walensky. About 94% of monkeypox cases are associated with sexual contact and nearly all of the people who have contracted the virus are men who have sex with men, according to Demetre Daskalakis, the deputy head of the White House monkeypox response team. A CDC survey of 824 gay and bisexual men found that 48% respondents have reduced their number of sexual partners and 50% have reduced one-time sexual encounters during the current outbreak. A separate CDC study found that a 40% decrease in one-time sexual encounters would reduce the final percentage of gay and bisexual men infected with monkeypox by up to 31%. \"We're actually seeing vaccine get out, behaviors change, harm-reduction messages being heard and implemented,\" Walensky said. \"And all of that working together to bend the curve.\" Correction: 33% of confirmed monkeypox cases are among Black Americans. A previous version of this story misstated the figure."},

But booking airfare on a certain day of the week isn't one of them, according to data from Google Flights. Booking mid-week \u2014 and especially Tuesdays around midnight \u2014 is often cited as the best time to purchase flights. But in the past five years, U.S. airfares purchased on Tuesdays, Wednesday or Thursdays have been only 1.9% cheaper on average than airfares purchased during the weekend, according to Google Flights. \"If your trip is just a couple of weeks away, don't wait for Tuesday to roll around \u2014 book your flight now in case the price goes up,\" wrote James Byers, Google Flights' group product manager, on a blog post published yesterday. While the day of the week travelers book may not matter much, the day they fly does, according to Google Flights' research, which examined five years of historical flight data from Aug. 1, 2017 to Aug. 1, 2022. \"On average, flights that depart on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday have been 12% cheaper than weekend departures,\" wrote Byers. \"If you exclude international destinations, the potential savings jump even higher to 20%.\" Another common strategy \u2014 booking early \u2014 also works, according to the data. For U.S. domestic flights, airfares have been lowest between three and eight weeks before a departure date, with prices \"bottoming out\" 44 days out, according to the research. Non-stop flights cost on average about 20% more than connecting flights, according to Google Flights, but flights with stops also increase the risk of interruptions. An Instagram poll by the travel insurance company World Nomads indicated more than 1 in 3 respondents spent up to $250 on flights, meals or hotels because of flight delays or cancellations this summer, while 12% reported spending between $500 to $1,000. Travelers with flexible flying days can use Google Flights' \"date grid\" function to quickly ascertain the cheapest dates to depart and arrive in a given week. Those who want to travel for a specific duration \u2014 say, two weeks \u2014 but are flexible on when, can use the \"price graph\" function to see the cheapest times to fly too. Price tracking also eliminates the need to search again and again to price-check a desired route. Search the route once, hit the button to \"track prices\" and Google Flights will send notifications of airfare changes via email. Based on its historical data, Google Flights also suggests the \"best times\" to book flights for peak-period travel and popular routes. Travelers hoping to save money on airfare to Europe are advised to plan the earliest, while summer vacationers can consider making plans weeks, rather than months, in advance."},

Here are their stories. Job: Emmy-award winning TV host of \" Samantha Brown's Places to Love\"\nStarted in: Comedy \" I went to Syracuse University for musical theater because I so desperately wanted to move to New York City and become a thespian. I wanted to do Shakespeare and be on Broadway. That didn't pan out. I waited on tables for a good eight years. But I loved improv, and I was a part of an improv comedy troupe. So I just kept auditioning for jobs. A writer recommended me to a production company that was \u2026 looking for a host. But my audition for it had to be totally improvised. That's how I got the job. When you are a travel host, there's no script. Yet it is still up to you to define the scene, to understand the trajectory of a story and how to end it. Also in improv, the golden rule is to never say no, it's always yes \u2014 to keep things going. Waiting on tables in New York City for eight years, you start to be really humbled, [but] those were the tools that I had that got me a job that I never in my wildest dreams thought I would ever have.\" Job: Creator of \" Strictly Dumpling\" and other YouTube channels (total: about 8 million subscribers)\nStarted in: Accounting and wedding videography \"I moved to the U.S. from China when I was 8 years old. My parents started working in restaurants, and eventually started their own very Americanized Chinese restaurant. So I grew up on a steady diet of General Tso's chicken and crab rangoon. There wasn't a lot of diversity where I'm from, but it helped that my parents sent me back to China when I was 13. Most people get grounded and sent to their room as a punishment \u2014 I got sent to China for two years. That's when I was like: Wow, it's so amazing \u2014 the people, the history \u2014 I want to know more. After college, I went to New York and worked on Wall Street for a year. Then I became a wedding videographer because I wanted to be flexible. I was living in a small basement apartment in Brooklyn with no air conditioning, making about $400 \u2014 on a good week. But this was the first time I was eating something that wasn't Red Lobster and Olive Garden. I got a taste of diverse ethnic food in Chinatown, and I started to discover a lot of my heritage that I never really saw as important before. I started recording food videos on YouTube as a food diary for myself. I remember having a conversation with a friend that food content will never amount to anything. There wasn't anybody online doing it. I had like 10 subscribers. Somehow it grew to this, which was never expected. I never really had much money growing up \u2014 or throughout most of my adulthood. So I was always looking for things that were inexpensive but also really filling and delicious. And that's pretty much what I do around the world now.\" Job: Television host of \" Family Travel with Colleen Kelly\"\nStarted in: Sales \"I tried out for the broadcast school at the University of Texas. The school gave you one chance to be accepted into the program. I had never sat at an anchor desk with a camera pointed at me. I failed miserably. Several years later, I graduated and got my first job in sales, eventually moving to Chicago and working in the pharmaceutical industry. The money was amazing, and I had a company car. But I wasn't living my dream, and this started to really bother me. In my early 30s, I got married and eventually quit my job to be a stay-at-home mom. One day, when my two little girls were in school, I went to our town hall's cable TV station and asked if, in exchange for teaching me how to edit, I could host the local entertainment show about our village \u2014 something like \"Access Hollywood\" for our 50,000-resident town. Because they had no other offers, they said yes. I acted confident, but I was as green as they come. I was shaking in my boots every time I did an interview and read voice-over, but I was gaining experience and knowledge. I confided in another mom that my dream was to host a national travel show, and, surprisingly, she agreed to produce it with me. We wrote a script, found a local camera guy for a few dollars and made a pilot. I took meetings with two major companies \u2014 both said no. I was told by one network that women don't watch travel shows, so the concept of family travel didn't appeal to them. I then sent thousands of emails to television stations. Nothing worked. Finally, my mother suggested I call the local PBS station. I googled the head of programming, called him (no emails) and got a meeting. After more meetings, we learned PBS was picking two shows to go national, and \"Family Travel with Colleen Kelly\" was one of them. We scraped by for a year, producing 13 episodes that first season. Now, the show has been on for more than 10 years. And, the best part is that I can bring my family with me. It's been a long and arduous journey, but I hope this story inspires others to believe in themselves, ignore the naysayers, and never give up on their dream.\" Editor's note: These interviews have been edited for length and clarity."},

The sister of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was speaking at the Global Supertrends Conference 2022 on Wednesday. The Web3 is a hypothetical, future version of the internet based on blockchain technology \u2014 an \"ideal utopia,\" said Zuckerberg. \"But \u2026 that's not what's happening. What's happening in reality, is chaos.\" The founder and CEO of Zuckerberg Media, a production company and marketing consultancy, added, \"You're the only one watching your own back and your own assets, people are spending time protecting themselves by setting up so many different wallets and protecting their identity and that's not contributing to development in the area.\" Zuckerberg, who was an early employee at Meta \u2014 formerly known as Facebook \u2014 explained that various metaverses are now acting as \"their own walled garden,\" in which users are unable to use their assets across platforms. The metaverse can be loosely defined as a virtual world where people live, work and play. With cryptocurrency, users can buy and develop virtual land or dress their own avatars. \"Right now, I'm on Decentraland, my son is on Roblox, my other son is on Fortnite. That's great \u2014 we're all in the metaverse. [But] we have no interaction with one another,\" she said. \"In order to really unlock the potential [of Web3], we're going to need to figure out a system where there's interoperability. What you have goes with you wherever you are, [and] we're not there yet,\" Zuckerberg added. However, according to Zuckerberg, that's easier said than done because no company running a metaverse right now wants to give up control or \"share that ownership.\" \"That's why it's not we're not seeing that kind of consumer mainstream adoption yet because there needs to be a world where you leave the house with one wallet. And you need to see that same behavior online also.\" She added that Web3 needs experts who have been involved in the global banking system and Web2 \u2014 the internet that we know today \u2014 to lend a \"protective layer.\" The need for such experts is all the more important because it has been \"too easy\" for users to be scammed or lose all their assets in Web3, said Zuckerberg. \"There needs to be more protections for consumers \u2026 I think we will wind up [with] web 2.7, where there is some centralization, keeping people safe, but the ability to port your assets with you to any site.\" Another thing that needs to be improved in Web3 is user-friendliness, she added. \"It should not take 45 steps to set up a cryptocurrency wallet, buy a currency and enter the metaverse. It needs to [be] one-stop, beginner-friendly.\" The metaverse may still be in its infancy, but Zuckerberg pointed out that sectors like real estate will be \"extremely valuable.\" \"Wherever there's scarcity \u2026 there's value. I think the big question will just be, is there scarcity in the metaverse and if there is, there will be value in real estate there,\" she added. According to data from MetaMetrics Solutions, real estate sales in the metaverse surpassed $500 million in 2021 and could double in 2022. Zuckerberg said that education and training will be another \"huge area\" for opportunities and revenue. \"Especially in this new age where workers are remote, it is very difficult to upskill remote workers \u2026 I think training in the metaverse, education in an interactive way, is going to become crucial for every business that has a remote work,\" she added. \"We're really just scratching the surface of what we're going to see.\""},

{"url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2022/09/01/health/acip-cdc-updated-covid-booster/index.html", "title": "CDC signs off on updated Covid-19 boosters ", "paragraphs": " Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, signed off Thursday on the recommendation of the agency's independent vaccine advisers in favor of updated Covid-19 vaccine boosters from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna. The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted 13 to 1 earlier in the day to recommend updated mRNA boosters for Americans this fall. Walensky's decision means the shots could be available by Friday, according to pharmaceutical manufacturers, which began shipping the new doses after the US Food and Drug Administration authorized them Wednesday. \"The updated COVID-19 boosters are formulated to better protect against the most recently circulating COVID-19 variant,\" Walensky said in a statement. \"They can help restore protection that has waned since previous vaccination and were designed to provide broader protection against newer variants. This recommendation followed a comprehensive scientific evaluation and robust scientific discussion. If you are eligible, there is no bad time to get your COVID-19 booster and I strongly encourage you to receive it.\" The updated boosters have instructions that tell our cells to make antibodies against two strains of the virus that causes Covid-19: the original strain and the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron subvariants, which share the same spike. Pfizer/BioNTech's updated vaccine is a 30-microgram dose authorized for people 12 and older. Moderna's updated vaccine is a 50-microgram dose authorized for people 18 and older. The CDC said in the statement that it \"also expects to recommend updated COVID-19 boosters for other pediatric groups\" in the coming weeks. People are eligible for the updated boosters as long as they have completed all primary doses in their vaccine series. The committee recommended that the new boosters be given at least two months after the last dose of any Covid-19 vaccine and up to three months after an infection. The new formulations do not replace shots for the primary series. The boosters were approved based on studies in mice bred to have human ACE-2 receptors -- the doors the coronavirus uses to get into our cells -- but clinical trial data showing how well they may work in humans won't be available for another month or two. This is similar to the way annual flu shots are studied and approved, but it's the first time for Covid-19 vaccines. In approving the vaccines, regulators also reviewed data behind different two-strain boosters. Those carry instructions to fight the original strain of the Omicron variant, BA.1, along with the original virus. Those boosters have been studied in about 1,400 people. They have been authorized for use in the UK and Canada but will not be available in the US. Several of the committee members said Thursday that they were uncomfortable recommending a vaccine with no human data to back it. \"We're been extrapolating the data that has been seen with the bivalent BA.1, and hopefully, we'll have similar data for BA.4 and BA.5,\" said Dr. Pablo Sanchez, a pediatrician at Ohio State University and a member of the committee. \"So I'm just concerned about that extrapolation. And because and ultimately, I really don't want to establish a precedent of recommending a vaccine that we don't have clinical data,\" said Sanchez, who voted against the recommendation. That prompted a quick rebuttal from government experts who work with the committee. \"I just would like to remind the committee that every year, we use influenza vaccines that are based on new strains without clinical studies being done,\" said Dr. Melinda Wharton, associate director for vaccine policy at the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. Dr. Doran Fink, deputy director of the FDA's Division of Vaccines and Related Products Applications, said, \"I do appreciate the amount of discomfort that I'm hearing from committee members who are being asked to take this leap with the Covid vaccines that they haven't been asked to make previously with the Covid vaccines. \"FDA felt very comfortable with the approach of extrapolating the safety and effectiveness or rather the known and potential benefits,\" Fink said. \"We recognize that we've taken a different path than the regulatory authorities have in Europe and Canada.\" Fink said the US chose to go this route based on feedback from its independent advisory group and projections for the viruses that may be circulating in this country over the fall and winter. On Thursday, the committee saw new modeling data that suggested there were substantial risks to waiting to roll out new boosters. According to the CDC's forecasts, boosters given to US adults in September could prevent 137,000 more hospitalizations and 9,700 deaths than if the boosters were held until November. New analyses on the cost-effectiveness of the boosters suggest that the US could save at least $63 billion in medical costs between August and March 31 if as many people get these boosters as got flu shots during the 2021-22 season. In the studies that looked at the shot targeting BA.1 along with the original, the boosters broadened immunity against many variants, and they were proven to be better than the older single-strain boosters because they made higher levels of antibodies. Moderna presented tantalizing data suggesting that the two-strain shots it developed against the Beta variant might extend the length of protection people get from their vaccines, which currently drops off significantly after about four months. It said a study on these results was being prepared for publication In mice bred to have human ACE-2 receptors, the two-strain vaccines against BA.4 and BA.5 protected better against infections in their lungs, compared with the original vaccine. About two-thirds of the total US population is vaccinated against Covid-19 with an initial series, according to data from the CDC. But less than half of those with their initial series -- and less than a third of the total population -- has also gotten a booster.

Finance ministers from the G7 group of countries \u2014 the United States, Japan, Canada, Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom \u2014 said they would ban the provision of \"services which enable maritime transportation of Russian-origin crude oil and petroleum products globally\" above the price cap. That could block insurance cover or finance for oil shipments. The maximum price would be set by \"a broad coalition\" of countries, they said in a joint statement. It would take effect alongside the European Union's next batch of sanctions, which include a ban on seaborne imports of Russian oil starting in early December. Russia had already threatened to retaliate by banning oil exports to countries that implement a price cap. \"We will simply not supply oil and petroleum products to such companies or states that impose restrictions, as we will not work non-competitively,\" Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak told reporters Thursday, according to state news agency TASS. The Biden administration has been pushing for governments to introduce a price cap for months. The West has already , but Moscow has continued to earn billions of dollars a month by diverting oil to countries such as China and India. \"The price cap is specifically designed to reduce Russian revenues and Russia's ability to fund its war of aggression whilst limiting the impact of Russia \u0301s war on global energy prices, particularly for low and middle-income countries,\" the G7 finance ministers said. But the measure still needs work and will be extremely complex to manage. The price at which Russian oil will be capped still needs to be hashed out It would also need wider international support to be effective. \"What China and India do is going to need to be a national decision for them,\" a senior US Treasury Department official said on a call with reporters Friday. But if the cap forces Russia to strike cheaper deals with trading partners by putting a ceiling on the price at which they can sell their products, it will still achieve its goals, the official added. Novak has called the proposals to impose restrictions \"completely absurd\" and said they could destroy the global oil market, TASS reported. \"Such attempts will only destabilize the oil industry, the oil market,\" he said. Russia could offer alternative insurance for its oil shipments. But the US Treasury official noted they would be more expensive, raising incentives for buyers to opt in to the price cap system. Flows of crude oil and other oil products to the United States, United Kingdom, European Union, Japan and South Korea have dropped by nearly 2.2 million barrels per day since the start of the war in Ukraine, according to the International Energy Agency. But two-thirds of this decline has been rerouted to , helping pad Moscow's coffers. Export revenues in July were about $19 billion, the IEA said. Russia's control of large swaths of global energy supplies remains a major challenge six months since its invasion of Ukraine. This week, Russia temporarily natural gas deliveries to the region through a vital pipeline and cut off all supplies to a French utility, exacerbating problems that have sent European inflation to a record high of 9%. Russian state energy giant Gazprom said that the cut in deliveries through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline was due to a planned shutdown for a few days for maintenance work. It is supposed to reopen on Saturday."},

Now, a battery-powered glove could help workers by taking some of the strain. The \"Ironhand\" glove strengthens the wearer's grip, meaning they don't have to use as much force to perform repetitive manual tasks. Its developer, Bioservo, says it can increase the wearer's hand strength by 20%. The Swedish company describes the system as a \"soft exoskeleton.\" Exoskeletons are an external device that supports and protects the body, typically increasing strength and endurance. Most have a rigid structure, but the Ironhand is soft, like a regular glove. \"When you have the glove on, it provides strength and reduces the effort needed when lifting objects,\" says Mikael Wester, Bioservo's marketing director. \"It's all in order to reduce fatigue and prevent strain injuries in the long run.\" The system consists of a backpack, which houses the power pack, and artificial tendons that connect to the glove. There are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object. A remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip. Wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry, using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses. Each Ironhand system costs around \u20ac6,000 ($7,275). The device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer's risk of developing strain injuries. According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, work-related neck and upper limb disorders are the , costing national economies up to 2% of their gross national product. The glove was originally intended for workers in a very different setting to the factory floor. NASA developed an early version of the technology, called \"Robo-Glove,\" to help astronauts grasp objects and carry out work in space. Bioservo licensed the design in 2016 and then partnered with auto manufacturer General Motors (GM) to develop the glove for its workers. \"Ergonomics is really the field of trying to fit the jobs to the workers, instead of the workers having to conform and adapt to the job,\" says Stephen Krajcarski, a senior manager with GM's ergonomics team. \"By using tools such as the Ironhand we are really trying to mitigate any potential concerns or physical demands that may eventually cause a medical concern for that individual operator.\" Krajcarski says GM has helped Bioservo to test and improve the Ironhand by piloting it in a variety of jobs at its manufacturing plants. He says some workers have found it easy to use but adds that it's not suitable for all situations. The Ironhand is just one of the exoskeletons GM is looking into. According to market research firm ABI Research, the exoskeleton market will grow from . \"If you look at exoskeletons, this is just one of the tools that are out there,\" says Krajcarski. \"But this is an exciting technology.\" This story has been updated to correct the cost of the Ironhand system."},

All trials had over 1,000 participants and at least two years of follow up. They also looked at four double-blind trials of more and less intense statin regimens. Study author Colin Baigent, a professor of epidemiology at University of Oxford, said that there have been many non-randomized studies which don't involve any kind of placebo or random allocation to a statin that have produced \"really quite extreme\" estimates of how much muscle pain statins cause. \"This has put patients off starting statins, or made them stop treatment when they develop muscle pain because they simply look in the paper and they see that statins cause lots and lots of muscle pain and so they stop,\" Baigent said during a Science Media Center briefing. \"We were really trying to deal with that problem.\" The new study says that \"even during the first year of a moderate-intensity statin regimen, it is likely to be the cause in only approximately one in 15 patients who report muscle symptoms, rising to approximately one in 10 in those who are taking a more intensive regimen. \"In other words, the statin is not the cause of muscle symptoms in more than 90% of individuals who report such symptoms.\" The authors found that in the first year, statin therapy produced a 7% relative increase in muscle pain or weakness, but there was no significant increase after that. The increased risk was already present within the first three months after treatment was assigned. There were reports of at least one episode of muscle pain or weakness from 27.1% of patients assigned a statin versus 26.6% of those who had a placebo during a median 4.3 year follow up. In the trials looked at by the authors, they say that statin therapy, during the first year of use, caused approximately 11 additional muscle pain reports per 1,000 patients. \"What we conclude is that there are two things that we need to do as a profession, as a society,\" Baigent said in the briefing. \"The first thing is, we need to do a better job of managing patients who report muscle pain when they are taking a statin, because there's a tendency in patients to end up stopping the statin and that has a detrimental effect on their long term health. And the second thing we need to do is we need to look at the information that is available to patients in package inserts.\" He noted that if people were better informed about the real risks of muscle pains, then they might stay on statin therapy for longer. The study does have some limitations, including considerable heterogeneity in the methods used for muscle symptoms, some adverse event data not being available and most of the studies not excluding participants who may now be categorized as statin intolerant. In a commentary published alongside the study, Dr. Maciej Banach, a cardiologist at the Medical University of Lodz and Polish Mother's Memorial Hospital Research Institute in Poland, wrote that the possible side effects of statins shouldn't be a consideration when starting treatment. \"It should be strong emphasized that the small risk of muscle symptoms is insignificant in comparison with the highly proven cardiovascular benefits of statins,\" he wrote. The says heart disease is the leading cause of death for men, women and those of most racial and ethnic groups in the United States. There is one cardiovascular disease death every 34 seconds in the country. Last week, the US Preventive Services Task Force announced its latest guidance on the use of statins to prevent a first heart attack or stroke. The guidelines are more conservative than those put out by other groups, such as the American College of Cardiology. They recommend statins in adults 40 to 75 who have at lease one risk factor of cardiovascular disease and a 10% or high risk of a heart attack in the next 10 years. According to the , \"statins are recommended for most partients and have been directly associated with a reduction in the risk of heart attack and stroke. Statins continue to provide the most effective lipid-lowering treatment in most cases.\" CNN's Jen Christensen contributed to this report"},

But despite covering more than of the Earth's surface, the ocean is still a relative mystery. In fact, we know more about the than we do about the sea floor; just over of the ocean bed has been mapped. Getting a fuller picture would enable us to navigate ships more safely, create more accurate climate models, lay down telecommunication cables, build offshore windfarms and protect marine species -- all part of what's known as the \"blue economy,\" projected to be worth by 2030. Underwater robotic vehicles equipped with sensors are helping gather that data quicker and more cheaply than ever before. But many of these vehicles rely on batteries with a limited lifespan, and need to return to a boat or the shore to recharge, making it difficult for them to map more remote parts of the sea. A five-year-old startup called is rising to the challenge, founded by oceanographer Yi Chao. While working at NASA, he developed technology to power ocean robots by harnessing \"the naturally occurring temperature difference\" of the sea, Chao told CNN Business. The power module can be installed on existing data-gathering robots or Seatrec's own floating device. This dives a kilometer down to examine the chemistry and shape of the seabed, using sonar to create a map of the surrounding area. The robot returns to the surface to send back its findings via satellite. As the float moves between colder and warmer parts of the ocean, material inside the module either melts or solidifies, causing pressure that in turn creates thermal energy and powers the robot's generator. \"They get charged by the sea, so they can extend their lifetime almost indefinitely,\" Chao said. A basic float model typically costs around $20,000. Attaching Seatrec's energy system adds another $25,000, Chao said. But the access to free, renewable energy and the ability to stay in the water longer makes data gathering up to five times cheaper in the long run, according to Chao. He said the startup is making fewer than 100 devices per year, primarily for marine researchers, but the technology is easily scalable -- Seatrec's energy module can also be can be retrofitted onto existing mapping devices to extend their range. New technologies that can extend the reach of data-gathering devices are crucial for mapping more remote parts of the deep sea, according Jamie McMichael-Phillips, director of the Nippon Foundation-GEBCO . \"One of the huge challenges we have is quite simply physics,\" said McMichael-Phillips. \"Unlike mapping the Earth's surface where we can use a camera [or] satellites, at sea, light does not penetrate through the water column. So we're pretty much limited to using sonar systems.\" Launched in 2017, the Seabed 2030 Project has increased awareness about the importance of the ocean floor, and given researchers and companies a clear goal to work towards: map the entire seafloor by the end of this decade. Some companies, such as , are surveying the ocean from the surface. Another startup, Bedrock Ocean Exploration, says it can provide surveys of seabed areas up to 10 times faster than traditional methods by using an autonomous electric submarine fitted with sonars, cameras and lasers; the data is then analyzed on Bedrock's own cloud platform. Even with the growing number of technologies accelerating seabed exploration, completing the map is still a logistical and financial challenge. Chao estimates that it would take 3,000 of Seatrec's floats operating over the next 10 years to fully survey the ocean. The company has raised in seed funding to scale up production of its energy harvesting system. But this is a drop in the ocean of the capital needed to fully survey the ocean, which is estimated to be \"somewhere between $3 to $5 billion,\" according to McMichael-Phillips -- \"pretty much the same order of magnitude as the cost of sending a mission to Mars.\" Bedrock's DiMare believes it's time we start investing in our own planet. \"If we want to keep Earth as a place that humans can live,\" he said, \"we have got to get a lot smarter about what's going on in the ocean.\""},

Is it quickest to get the train or the bus? What about a taxi or a city bike? Which provider has the nearest e-scooter? It can be inconvenient and time consuming. Which is why Finnish startup MaaS Global decided to aggregate all these services into one app called Whim. Available in more than 10 cities across Europe and Asia, users can access taxis, buses, bikes, e-scooters and rental cars. \"Whim's sole purpose is to compete against car ownership,\" CEO Sampo Hietanen tells CNN Business. According to the International Energy Agency, transport is responsible for , most of which come from . If Whim can persuade users to trade their car keys for a single app offering multiple transport options, the environmental impact could be enormous, says Hietanen. He admits this isn't an easy task. To succeed Whim has to be more convenient and cheaper than owning a car. \"The car represents freedom of mobility,\" says Hietanen \u2014 even if a city dweller barely uses it, they still keep it parked outside as a \"freedom insurance.\" To compete, Whim offers rental cars and taxis, but Hietanen says that users tend to opt for public transport or micromobility (shared lightweight vehicles such as bikes or e-scooters). Users can choose between multiple tiers of service, including a pay-as-you-go option and a 30-day season ticket, which costs \u20ac62 ($73) in Helsinki \u2014 where the app is most established \u2014 for unlimited public transport and short taxi rides. The ticket also offers car rental from \u20ac55 ($65) per day. While Helsinki has well-developed alternatives to driving, that's not true of everywhere. If a city \"does not have a wide public transport system or a lot of rental cars or taxis in place\" then it will be difficult to convince people to give up their cars, says Maria Kamargianni, associate professor of transport and energy at University College London. She says apps like Whim represent the first step in tempting people away from car ownership, and adds that the availability of alternative transport options is likely to improve as the market matures. Research firm predicts the global mobility service market will grow from $4.7 billion in 2020 to $70.4 billion by 2030. Other providers include Citymapper, which for Londoners in 2019, and Moovit, which launched an in Israel last year. Whim, launched in 2016, is one of the earliest providers and has raised more than $60 million from investors such as  ,  and Toyota Financial Services. It's available in several European cities and in Tokyo, and has racked up 18 million trips globally since launch. But the business has been hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, says Hietanen; with fewer people traveling, revenues are lower, stalling the company's expansion into other cities. Finnish newspaper recently reported that the company had spent \u20ac50 million ($59 million) on failed expansion ventures. Hietanen says the money was spent on integrating multiple transportation providers, establishing market readiness in several countries, and developing the complex technology that underpins the app. \"We've known from the beginning that the investment needed to create this would be substantial,\" he says, adding that the company has recently secured further investment. Though the industry is in its infancy, Hietanen is confident the demand will be there. A from the International Transport Forum (ITF) says that mobility services will be vital in meeting the needs of a growing world population and fast-paced urbanization. But for growth to happen, \"people must choose it over other travel options\" such as private motor vehicles. This is already happening, says Hietanen. According to a company survey carried out in Helsinki, 12% of its users said that Whim had prompted them to give up their cars. \"People want the more sustainable solution,\" he says, \"but they still want the freedom of being able to go anywhere, anytime.\""},
{"url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/25/tech/ftc-twitter-whistleblower/index.html", "title": "How much trouble is Twitter in with regulators?", "paragraphs": " An explosive whistleblower disclosure by Twitter's former head of security this week exposes the company to new federal investigations and potentially billions of dollars in fines, tougher regulatory obligations or other penalties from the US government, according to legal experts and former federal officials.  faces tremendous legal risks stemming from the whistleblower disclosure by Peiter \"Mudge\" Zatko, who claims in a to authorities that the company is riddled with information security flaws \u2014 and that in some cases its executives have misled its own board and the public on the company's condition, if not perpetrated outright fraud. Twitter has accused Zatko, who worked at the company from November 2020 until he was fired this January for what Twitter says was poor performance, of pushing \"a false narrative about Twitter and our privacy and data security practices that is riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies and lacks important context.\" Zatko is a highly regarded cybersecurity expert with experience in senior roles at Google, Stripe and the Defense Department. His whistleblower disclosure was first reported by CNN and The Washington Post on Tuesday. In his disclosure to the US government, Zatko claims Twitter suffers \"egregious deficiencies\" in its cybersecurity posture, deliberately misled regulators about its handling of user data and that the company is not living up to its obligations under a with the Federal Trade Commission \u2014 a legally binding order that requires, among other things, the creation of \"reasonable safeguards\" to protect users' personal information. The FTC declined to comment on the disclosure. Zatko's damning disclosure alleges that roughly half of Twitter employees, including all its engineers, have excessive internal access to the company's live product, known within the company as \"production,\" along with actual user data. It also alleges the company lacks the ability to defend against insider threats, foreign governments and accidental data leaks. \"A fundamental engineering and security principle is that access to live production environments should be limited as much as possible,\" the disclosure says. \"But at Twitter, engineers built, tested, and developed new software directly in production with access to live customer data and other sensitive information in Twitter's system.\" Twitter has told CNN its FTC compliance record speaks for itself, citing third-party audits filed to the agency under the 2011 consent order. Twitter added it complies with relevant privacy regulations and that it has been transparent with regulators about its efforts to fix any shortcomings in its systems. Zatko did not participate in the audit work and did not fully comprehend Twitter's FTC obligations or how the company was fulfilling them, Twitter said. The disclosure claims Zatko's staff were \"intimately familiar\" with Twitter's issues before the FTC and that it was they who told Zatko Twitter was never in compliance with the 2011 order, nor on track to become compliant. \"We absolutely stand by the contents of Mudge's disclosure,\" John Tye, Zatko's lawyer and founder of Whistleblower Aid, the organization representing him, told CNN. Zatko may be eligible for a monetary award from the US government as a result of his whistleblower activities. \"Original, timely and credible information that leads to a successful enforcement action\" by the SEC can earn whistleblowers up to a 30% cut of agency fines related to the action if the penalties amount to more than $1 million, the SEC has said. The SEC has awarded more than $1 billion to more than 270 whistleblowers since 2012. Zatko filed his disclosure to the SEC \"to help the agency enforce the laws,\" and to gain federal whistleblower protections, Tye said. \"The prospect of a reward was not a factor in Mudge's decision, and in fact he didn't even know about the reward program when he decided to become a lawful whistleblower.\" The whistleblower disclosure comes months after the FTC that Twitter misused account security information for advertising purposes in violation of the 2011 order. Twitter in May to resolve those claims, in a second FTC settlement. Now, Zatko's disclosure raises the prospect of yet another possible violation of Twitter's FTC commitments \u2014 an extraordinarily dangerous position for a company and its executives to be in, according to Jon Leibowitz, who was chair of the FTC at the time of Twitter's 2011 settlement. \"If the facts are true, they would constitute violations of the order and of the FTC Act \u2014 and that would make Twitter a three-time loser,\" Leibowitz told CNN in an interview. \"There would be no reason for the FTC not to throw the book at them.\" Of course, Leibowitz added, the FTC would need to conduct a thorough investigation first to determine for itself whether a new violation has occurred. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, chair of the Senate subcommittee on consumer protection and a former Connecticut attorney general, said in a statement Tuesday that Zatko's disclosures \"reveal that responsibility for Twitter's security failures rests with those at the top.\" He further urged the FTC in a letter to investigate the allegations, saying officials should fine and hold Twitter executives personally accountable if it's found they were responsible for violations of the FTC Act or Twitter's consent order. The FTC's own credibility is on the line, Blumenthal said in the letter, which was also sent to the FTC on Tuesday. \"If the Commission does not vigorously oversee and enforce its orders, they will not be taken seriously and these dangerous breaches will continue,\" Blumenthal wrote. Under its charter, the FTC is authorized to prosecute \"unfair or deceptive business acts and practices.\" In the internet age, that has increasingly meant going after companies that claim to protect consumers' digital information but that in fact fail to live up to their public claims or misrepresent those protections. Twitter's original 2011 settlement arose from where hackers were able to compromise weak employee passwords and misuse their access to take over Twitter accounts and snoop on private information, in spite of Twitter's public statements on safeguarding user privacy and security. Twitter's settlement was not an admission of wrongdoing. But it Twitter to create \"a comprehensive information security program that is reasonably designed to protect the security, privacy, confidentiality, and integrity of nonpublic consumer information\" \u2014 a commitment Zatko alleges has never been met. As part of its latest FTC settlement this year, Twitter committed to even more granular cybersecurity obligations including having \"access policies and controls\" for all databases containing user data, as well as for systems that either grant employees access to Twitter accounts or that have information that \"enables or facilitates\" access to internal Twitter systems. Those obligations are already in effect following a judge's signing of the order this spring, further heightening the potential legal exposure for Twitter. Despite Twitter's mounting regulatory requirements, Zatko alleges not much has changed at the company since the FTC's initial complaint more than a decade ago. \"Things actually got meaningfully worse,\" his disclosure to Congress alleges. The disclosure claims that even as Twitter was actively negotiating the second settlement with the FTC last year, the company, in an entirely separate incident, allowed the very same type of misuse of data for advertising purposes to recur. In response to more than 50 specific questions from CNN related to the disclosure, Twitter did not address Zatko's allegation surrounding that incident. It did acknowledge that its engineering and product teams are able to access Twitter's live production environment provided they have a specific business justification, adding that members of other departments \u2014 such as finance, legal, marketing, sales, human resources and support \u2014 cannot. Twitter also told CNN that employee computers are automatically checked to determine whether they are up to date, and those that fail the checks cannot connect to production. The stakes of the disclosure could be hugely significant. An FTC finding that Twitter has violated its order a third time could result in the harshest penalties the agency has ever imposed on the company. The FTC is also currently chaired by Lina Khan, a and of what she calls a \"commercial surveillance\" industry that profits off of lax national privacy rules. Under Khan, the FTC is considering drafting that could directly affect companies across the economy, including Twitter, and how they collect, use and share personal data. Should the FTC conclude a violation occurred, it would have two main options for holding Twitter accountable, former agency officials say. It could seek a third settlement with the company, or it could sue Twitter over the existing consent orders and ask a court for appropriate penalties. In the case of a settlement, the FTC could even seek to name individual executives \u2014 holding them personally accountable and forcing them to accept obligations on their own conduct for which they could be held liable if they or the company violate the order again. If it turns out that Twitter did violate its legal obligations, Leibowitz said, the FTC should \"very seriously consider ... putting the executives responsible under order.\" The mere threat of naming individual executives can be effective, he added. During his time as FTC chair, Leibowitz recalled, \"I can't tell you how many CEOs came into my office saying, 'Please don't name me. I just don't want to be named. I don't mind if I pay more money; I don't mind if my company is put under a stronger order. But I just don't want to be named.'\" Megan Gray, a former FTC enforcement attorney who has worked on some of the agency's biggest privacy cases, said the tools at the FTC's disposal are numerous. (CNN spoke to Gray prior to Zatko's allegations becoming public and without disclosing their existence, and then again on Tuesday after CNN and The Washington Post reported Zatko's disclosure.) \"Escalating fines, more compliance reports, more granular controls and restrictions on their lines of business,\" Gray said, ticking off a list of options. \"Or a requirement to get advertisements pre-approved by the agency, or excluding them from certain types of transactions.\" Twitter has cited its third-party audits as evidence it has upheld its FTC commitments. But in general, the way the FTC's audit requirements often work in practice can let companies off the hook far too easily, Gray said. For example, many FTC orders are written broadly enough to allow a company to satisfy its obligations based on, among other things, \"attestations\" that they are compliant \u2014 a pinkie promise, Gray told CNN. In reports to the FTC, companies conducting third-party audits may simply say, or cite statements by the company under audit, that the company is in compliance. From 2011 until 2022, Twitter's consent order with the FTC allowed for audit reports based on attestations. Then, in its second settlement this year, the FTC made the audit requirements more specific, barring Twitter's third-party auditors from relying \"primarily\" on attestations by Twitter's management. Even with those types of restrictions, there are still reasons to be skeptical of FTC audit reports, Gray said. That's because third-party auditors are paid not by the FTC, but by the companies being audited, she said. \"So the incentives are completely out of whack for the auditing companies,\" Gray added. Twitter told CNN that audits are just one of the privacy and security programs Twitter has to meet its FTC obligations. Many current and former FTC officials, as well as US lawmakers and consumer advocates, have pushed to give the FTC more tools for holding businesses accountable, particularly after the Supreme Court last year the agency's ability to seek monetary relief under some circumstances. Some proponents of tougher oversight for example, letting the FTC issue fines to companies for first-time violations of the FTC Act. Currently, the FTC may generally only seek to impose civil penalties on a company In the case of Twitter, negotiating a consent order for a third time may seem like an odd look, another former FTC official said, speaking on condition of anonymity in order to speak more candidly. But in the event it finds a violation, and as with any case, the FTC will need to weigh what it believes it can obtain from Twitter through a settlement against what the agency may be able to win from a trial court. There are risks to long, drawn-out litigation, where a court may actually award the FTC less, the former official said. \"Some people do think these orders are kind of nothing,\" the former official said, \"but they're not. Maybe in some cases they are, and companies don't take them seriously. But in a lot of cases they do, and the FTC can exact a lot of pain. A lot of pain.\""},

Now, Asia's third largest economy is ready for the next big frontier in tech: Coming up with a new generation of software companies like Zoom or Slack. The Covid-19 pandemic has forced business around the world to make huge investments in digital infrastructure, furthering the influence of companies providing software-as-a-service, or SaaS. Businesses spent an extra $15 billion per week last year on tech as they scrambled to create safe remote working environments, . SaaS companies provide web-based applications that take care of everything from how secure the software is to how well it performs. Some of the world's most well-known SaaS companies include  , SAP Concur and  , the American behemoth that owns . India's software-as-a-service industry could be worth $1 trillion in value by 2030 and create nearly half a million new jobs, according to a compiled by consulting firm McKinsey & Co. and SaaSBoomi, a community of industry leaders. There are nearly a thousand such companies in India, of which 10 are unicorns, or startups worth at least $1 billion, the report said. \"This can be as big an opportunity as the IT services industry was in the 90s,\" said Girish Mathrubootham, CEO of Freshworks, India's best-known SaaS company. It filed for an last month, joining a string of other unicorns that are going public this year. Freshworks was founded more than a decade ago in the southern Indian city of Chennai. Like Salesforce, it provides software to help companies manage relations with their customers. It's also India's oldest unicorn in the sector, having raised funds from investors such as Tiger Global and Accel, and has more than 50,000 customers. The company was last valued at $3.5 billion in a 2019 funding round, according to data firm Tracxn. Other Indian SaaS firms have found traction by focusing on niche businesses. , for example, is a unicorn that builds software for the spa and beauty salon industry. Of India's 10 SaaS unicorns, six reached that milestone in 2020, and investors around the world are paying attention. Last year, investors pumped $1.5 billion into Indian SaaS companies, four times more than in 2018 or 2019, according to the SaaSBoomi report. Investors are excited about SaaS because of the \"massive adoption\" of software over the last decade, according to Mohit Bhatnagar, managing director of Sequoia Capital India. While India is a in the global SaaS market, investors say the country could eventually dominate the sector because of two things: its vast pool of English-speaking developers, and the relatively low cost of hiring them. Thanks to the rise of India's IT industry, software engineering has become one of the most in the country. \"India actually has one of the largest developer communities in the world,\" Bhatnagar told CNN Business. Many of them have worked at some of the biggest global tech companies. Abhinav Asthana, the co-founder of Postman, pointed to his experience working as an intern at Yahoo in Bengaluru as instrumental in the decision to build his product. He came up with the idea to build a tool that would simplify the API (Application Programming Interface) testing process. An API is a programming code that defines how two applications communicate with each other, and Postman says it has made it easier for engineers to work together as they design and build their APIs. \"We saw how software was created at these global companies, and we saw API was a key problem,\" Asthana told CNN Business. Now, Postman is India's most valuable SaaS unicorn, with a valuation of $5.6 billion. The low cost of operating in India is a big plus. According to a report by  , the salary of entry-level developers in India is 85% less than their counterparts in the United States. \"If you are building a SaaS company in the US, it is better to have a million-dollar client rather than a $10,000-client because you need to pay for sales and marketing in that country,\" said Prasanna Krishnamoorthy, managing partner at SaaS accelerator Upekkha. \"When you are serving customers from India, you can have these small and mid-sized companies, as well as large ones.\" Most SaaS companies focus on global clients, similar to the strategy that was followed by India's IT giants such as TCS and  . Investors see this as a welcome change, since most of India's oldest unicorns \u2014 from Flipkart to Paytm \u2014 have focused primarily on the domestic market. Almost 98% of Fortune 500 companies use Postman's products, according to Asthana, while Freshworks' first client was based in Australia. SaaS firms are much better placed to go global than e-commerce companies like India's Flipkart, for example. They write software once, and then are able to use it multiple times. \"For a Flipkart you need billions of dollars [to grow internationally], but for a Freshwork you need much less capital to go global,\" said Mathrubootham, who is also an investor in Postman. This is because e-commerce firms require a ton of money to set up physical operations elsewhere \u2014 they have to hire delivery drivers, rent warehouses and buy inventory. Bhatnagar of Sequoia Capital said that Indian software entrepreneurs \"mastered\" the art of \"remote sales\" fairly early. \"Honestly, in this last two years, the whole world has had to understand how to do better remote sales,\" he added. Despite the euphoria, there are some hurdles Indian companies have to overcome before they can deliver on the $1 trillion promise. Indian engineers trained in the IT services industry may find it hard to develop the discipline required to build a product-focused company. In IT services, \"you are selling bodies and you say yes to everything the customer says,\" said Krishnamoorthy. SaaS companies, on the other hand, have to say no to 99% of [potential] customers, he added. And India's startup ecosytem is still relatively immature when compared to Silicon Valley. Despite the massive size of some homegrown unicorns, Mathrubootham said that the country does not have a \"global tech powerhouse product brand.\" But he hoped that future SaaS companies can change that. \"It is my personal dream to see India as a product nation,\" he added."},

While the Burgesses were charged before the Supreme Court overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that protected the right to abortion, the case highlights issues of digital privacy that could have widespread ramifications post-Roe. The teenager, who was about 28-weeks along when her pregnancy ended, told investigators she had unexpectedly miscarried a stillborn fetus and that she and her mother buried the remains, according to an affidavit in support of a search warrant. But police went on to serve Meta, Facebook's parent company, a search warrant. After roughly 300MB of data, including private messages between the two, authorities allege the 41-year-old mother helped her daughter obtain abortion medication in Nebraska, where abortions are illegal after 20 weeks. Celeste Burgess, who was 17 at the time of the alleged incident, will be tried as an adult. Attorneys for both mother and daughter declined to comment to CNN. On Tuesday, Meta spokesperson Andy Stone a statement on the company's website saying, \"Court documents indicate that police were at that time investigating the alleged illegal burning and burial of a stillborn infant. The warrants were accompanied by non-disclosure orders, which prevented us from sharing information about them. The orders have now been lifted.\" As much as Meta wants to , emphasizing that \"the warrants did not mention abortion at all,\" they still can and should do  to safeguard users' privacy. Instead, they've been (Stone said in a Twitter post that Meta had \"discovered some instances of incorrect enforcement and are correcting these\") and, according to a obtained by the New York Times, ordering employees not to discuss the issue of abortion in the workplace. Long story short: If big tech isn't going to protect women and girls, then we have to protect ourselves. That starts by obtaining -- and sharing -- knowledge about our digital rights. Like many of us, privacy experts on the court walls long ago, and repeatedly sounded the alarm about the of pregnant women, their abortion providers and anyone who assists them. With abortion bans and restrictions now in numerous states, prosecutors could increasingly rely on digital data to punish pregnant people for their choices. It's a catch-22: inaccessible health care and hostile abortion laws online to seek medical advice, financial support or transportation -- but these searches expand that can later be used to prosecute them. So what are the risks? In states where abortion is illegal, personal data can be from , like what happened to Burgess, or from a third-party data broker. Your period tracking app can flag a pregnancy before you're even aware, your texts and emails could provide incriminating evidence, and as more red states consider abortion , your location tracking data or electronic transaction records might reveal a trip to Planned Parenthood in a neighboring state -- and the government can use all of that data against you in court. Burgess's story is, tragically, one of many. Even before Roe was overturned, women's data was . It's particularly alarming that women and girls are targeted online when we are already at a to men when it comes to digital literacy. We know that American girls are to abandon computer science courses between the ages of 13 and 17. As they grow up, they're , and they are searching for online. It's no wonder that women comprise only a , and in those positions than their male counterparts. This digital gender disparity is why I founded Girls Who Code 10 years ago. Today, I'm proud to say we're on track to in new entry-level tech jobs by 2030. But that success doesn't just prove women and girls' appetite for STEM -- it offers a blueprint for the massive education effort needed to enhance young women's digital literacy and safety. Part of that effort must be learning and sharing the simple tips for safer online interactions: using encrypted communications apps like Signal, making phone calls via Google Voice, creating (and promptly deleting) new email accounts to coordinate appointments and transit. For the more complicated stuff, we should rely on and support nonprofits like , and , which mobilized to help us understand both technology itself and our rights using it. Over the past few months, they've assembled an arsenal of resources that specifically advise abortion-seekers about surveillance, providing them with best encryption practices and private internet browser recommendations. We can even consult the Department of Health and Human Services' new under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) for securing one's personal health data. We must urge our legislators to protect women's privacy by curbing abusive data practices and instituting stronger consumer privacy protections through proposed legislation like Sen. Elizabeth Warren's , or Rep. Sara Jacobs'  And if tech companies want to regain our trust, they must become . In addition to making end-to-end encryption the default setting in messaging apps, they can refuse to comply with requests for data that violate civil liberties, and even such data to protect our privacy. In all of this work, we must ensure digital privacy education reaches those who need it most. Historically, many , and have simultaneously  and are deprived of adequate healthcare, and other critical resources necessary for reproductive justice. We can't have true digital inclusion -- and justice -- if only some women can access this information. In Justice William O. Douglas' majority opinion in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), the court established the right to privacy -- and by extension, women's bodily autonomy -- within the \"penumbra\" of the Bill of Rights, that sliver of partial illumination between and \"full light.\" For so long, women and girls have had to assert our right to privacy -- in our phones, our homes and in our bodies -- in the shadows of the law and technology. By empowering women with a knowledge of our digital rights, we inch our way towards the full light -- where we have always deserved to be."},

Last month, Twitter's former head of security, Peiter \"Mudge\" Zatko, told Congress and federal agencies that the company's security practices pose grave threats to national security. As part of his disclosures, which were revealed by last week, Zatko claims that the company allows about half of its staff \u2014 which amounts to thousands of employees \u2014 access to critical controls, and one or more of them may be working for a foreign intelligence agency. He also alleges that the company does not adequately protect the security of user data, using servers with outdated software that are missing critical security features like encryption. What's more, he claims that he was discouraged from sharing the full extent of the company's security problems with its board. , of course, disputes the idea that it has big security problems. It told CNN that engineering and product teams can only access the production environment if they have \"a specific business justification,\" that employees use devices that IT and security teams oversee, and that if a device is running on outdated software, they can prevent it from connecting to sensitive internal systems. However, Twitter did not respond to questions about its alleged foreign intelligence vulnerabilities. A spokesperson told CNN that \"Mr. Zatko was fired from his senior executive role at Twitter in January 2022 for ineffective leadership and poor performance.\" The spokesperson also said, \"What we've seen so far is a false narrative about Twitter and our privacy and data security practices that is riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies and lacks important context.\" (Zatko contends that he was fired in retaliation for raising at the company.) This latest whistleblower report makes clear that social media platforms not only pose potential privacy risks to users, but also national security risks. Congress needs to urgently pass a law regulating what data social networks can collect, how they can share it, how they can store it, who can access it and under what circumstances. Lawmakers also need to give the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) a specific mandate to closely oversee social media companies' security and privacy practices. That would ensure that these companies follow any new regulations put in place. We simply can't trust them to maintain their own data collection and sharing and security standards. Consider the ramifications of a social media company's inadequate security protocols. If a company lacks proper safeguards to protect user passwords or employees' accounts, the accounts of legitimate sources such as high-profile people could be taken over and used to issue dangerous, even deadly, claims or directives. Recall that, in 2020, hackers took control of the Twitter accounts of people like Elon Musk, Bill Gates and Barack Obama to promote , and were tricked into forking over more than $100,000. The hackers accomplished this by targeting employees who had access to internal tools and were able to post the tweets. Further, if a company lacks protections against how many employees have access to user information and safeguards to ensure that employees and users aren't hacked, then hackers \u2014 or even employees \u2014 could gather sensitive information about users from their social media data and share it with foreign intelligence agencies. Gaining access to their passwords or private messages can reveal evidence of things like affairs or abortions that bad actors can use to try to blackmail them into spying. Does it sound crazy to think that a Twitter employee would sell user data to a foreign government? Just this month, a former Twitter employee was found guilty of giving private information about Twitter users to the government of in exchange for money. That's why it's critical for social networks to limit access to sensitive user information, store and share as little user data as possible, and take every possible measure to prevent hacks. Zatko's allegations suggest, at least at Twitter, this simply isn't happening. Such threats are too serious to leave to social media companies to manage on their own. We need legislation that strictly limits the number of employees who can have access to user data, prohibits the sharing of that data with third parties, and requires companies to take stronger measures to guard against hackings. Congress needs to step in urgently to help protect social media users \u2014 and the country \u2014 from the possibility of these kinds of breaches."},

Monday's suit targets Kochava, a marketing data company that lists major brands including Disney, McDonald's and Hilton among its clients. The FTC complaint alleges that Kochava failed to protect consumers when it publicly published samples of actual consumer data on Amazon's cloud services marketplace, and offered even more data to those who paid. In a statement Monday, Kochava said it has spent the past several weeks trying to explain its practices to the FTC, adding that it is currently rolling out a new feature called Privacy Block that \"effectively removes\" the sensitive location data from the data marketplace. The company's general manager, Brian Cox, accused the FTC of \"flamboyant press releases and frivolous litigation\" and said Kochava complies with all laws and privacy regulations. \"Unfortunately the only outcome the FTC desired was a settlement that had no clear terms or resolutions and redefined the problem into a moving target,\" Cox said. The suit comes amid mounting scrutiny of data brokers, tech platforms and other companies that handle consumers' location data generated by smartphones and other devices, as privacy advocates have warned new state laws restricting abortion could lead to abortion-seekers' location histories being used against them as evidence of wrongdoing. According to the FTC, Kochava's data had not been anonymized, so by combining its location records with data from other sources, it would be possible to deduce a person's actual identity based on the information Kochava was offering. In conducting the investigation that led to the suit, the FTC said it analyzed a Kochava sample set that covered more than 60 million unique mobile devices over the span of a single week. Kochava's data includes precise, timestamped latitude and longitude information for individual consumers, according to the complaint, which highlighted data linked to one specific person to illustrate how revealing the information can be. \"The data may be used to identify consumers who have visited an abortion clinic and, as a result, may have had or contemplated having an abortion,\" the complaint said. \"In fact, in just the data Kochava made available in the Kochava Data Sample, it is possible to identify a mobile device that visited a women's reproductive health clinic and trace that mobile device to a single family residence. The data set also reveals that the same mobile device was at a particular location at least three evenings in the same week, suggesting the mobile device user's routine. The data may also be used to identify medical professionals who perform, or assist in the performance, of abortion services.\" Under its charter, the FTC is authorized to prosecute unfair or deceptive business practices. In this case, the agency alleges that Kochava's data practices are unfair because the practices could cause harm to consumers they cannot avoid. In the wake of the Supreme Court's decision rolling back federal abortion rights this year, the FTC has signaled an increasing focus on protecting health-related data. Following a White House that called on the FTC to protect abortion seekers' privacy, the agency that it would hold data brokers and others accountable for misuse of data or mischaracterizations of data policies. Regulators at the agency are also mulling that could have sweeping ramifications for how businesses can collect, use and share personal information, including location information."},

From data about which cell towers your smartphone has been communicating with to your specific GPS coordinates, your smartphone constantly gives off a tremendous amount of information on your whereabouts, the letters from AT&T, Verizon and other carriers show. For example, T-Mobile retains granular latitude and longitude coordinates of devices on its network for up to 90 days, and less-granular cell-site location data for up to two years, the company told the FCC in a letter dated Aug. 3. Verizon said it holds cell-site data for up to one year, while AT&T said it may retain cell-site data for up to five years. The company letters highlight how telecom companies, and cooperate with government requests for personal information \u2014 an issue that's received intense scrutiny in recent months as new state laws restricting abortion have prompted critics to cellular location data being used to prosecute abortion-seekers. In addition to sending official data requests to companies, government agencies have also resorted to simply buying personal data from the open market themselves, a practice US lawmakers have this year. That sensitive data, privacy advocates have said, can reveal whether a person may have visited an abortion clinic or sought other reproductive care, even if the location data was merely collected for the purposes of facilitating an unrelated call or mobile web search at the time. \"Governments collect information for many reasons. But, all too often, data collected by the state is misused and weaponized for other purposes,\" the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group, wrote in this spring. FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel didn't explicitly mention potential risks related to reproductive care or abortion in to more than a dozen top US wireless carriers in July. But the inquiries came less than a month after the Supreme Court's decision to overturn federal abortion rights in June, and amid heightened scrutiny of the many companies that handle location information and to law enforcement requests for that data in connection with abortion prosecutions. \"Given the highly sensitive nature of this data \u2014 especially when location data is combined with other types of data, the ways in which this data is stored and shared with third parties is of utmost importance to consumer safety and privacy,\" Rosenworcel wrote at the time. Last week, Rosenworcel added she has called on the FCC's enforcement bureau to investigate whether wireless carriers are doing enough to tell customers how their information is handled. There are many reasons a wireless carrier collects location information from subscribers, the companies told the FCC. One main reason is simply to operate the network as consumers would expect. But there are other reasons, too. For example, FCC rules require that carriers provide detailed information to 911 dispatchers in an emergency, down to a device's likely elevation so that first responders can more easily locate someone in need if they are on the fifth floor of a building. Carriers also collect location data for purposes that don't directly relate to the provision of wireless services. Verizon, for example, told the FCC it may use location data as part of an offering to third-parties that can \"develop insights to help estimate traffic patterns during the morning rush hour or how many customers go to a retail store.\" AT&T told the FCC it may collect location information in order to serve subscribers targeted ads. While in some cases consumers may be able to opt out of this data collection \u2014 such as with AT&T's advertising program \u2014 they generally cannot opt out of having their location data shared with law enforcement, the carrier letters said. \"Like all companies, we are required by law to provide information to law enforcement and other government entities by complying with court orders, subpoenas, and lawful discovery requests,\" AT&T wrote to the FCC. \"In all cases, we review requests to determine whether they are valid.\""},

His plans went awry", "paragraphs": " As Covid-19 wreaked havoc around the world last year, the 39-year-old son of an Indian billionaire was laying the groundwork for a plan he hoped would eventually end the pandemic. Adar Poonawalla \u2014 the CEO of Serum Institute of India (SII), the world's largest vaccine maker \u2014 pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into his Indian manufacturing facility and committed to make millions of doses of a then-unproven coronavirus vaccine. That vaccine, created by Oxford University and  , was still in clinical trials at the time. Nobody was sure how long a vaccine would take to develop, let alone whether it would even work. \"It was a calculated risk,\" Poonawalla told CNN Business. \"But I didn't see the choice at that time, to be honest. I just felt I'd regret not committing one way or another.\" To make his plan work, Poonawalla first had to raise nearly $1 billion. And the lives of hundreds of millions of the planet's most vulnerable people were at stake, since SII had pledged to provide poorer countries with jabs. If the gamble paid off, Poonawalla would save countless lives and be hailed as a hero during a period of historic turmoil. His fabulously rich family also would stand to grow even more wealthy by profiting from a significant deal. As the world gave its money \u2014 and trust \u2014 to Poonawalla, things seemed to be going according to plan. The AstraZeneca vaccine received approval from UK regulators in December 2020, and Poonawalla became a household name in India. But soon it became evident how badly Poonawalla had miscalculated the challenges that come with distributing millions of vaccines in the middle of a once-in-a-century pandemic. His company's ability to inoculate even his own countrymen was thrown into doubt earlier this year as a devastating wave of coronavirus hit India. He's also failed to keep up with his commitment to deliver shots to other nations \u2014 the consequences of which have dented his reputation and shed light on the perils of such heavy reliance on one manufacturer. It's easy to see why some of the biggest names in public health chose to rely on Poonawalla. Few manufacturers can come close to the scale at which SII is able to produce vaccines. The company \u2014 which was founded by Poonawalla's father, Cyrus, 55 years ago \u2014 produces 1.5 billion vaccines each year for measles, rubella, tetanus and many other diseases. The jabs are mainly distributed to low-income countries worldwide, including India. Poonawalla estimates that just over 50% of the world's babies depend on vaccines made at SII. The Poonawalla family charted an unusual path to becoming one of the world's preeminent vaccine makers. They have bred and raced thoroughbred horses since the 1940s, diversifying into pharmaceuticals, finance and real estate over the last half-century. Cyrus Poonawalla is now India's seventh-richest man, worth more than $16 billion, according to the His son Adar took over as CEO in 2011 and has focused on expanding in . To prepare for the AstraZeneca vaccine production, Poonawalla said he spent $800 million on buying chemicals, glass vials and other raw materials, as well as ramping up manufacturing capacity at his plant in the Western Indian city of Pune. More than $250 million came from the company's own funds. Another $300 million came from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which SII with to provide discounted or free doses to low-income countries. The rest was paid by other countries once SII started accepting orders for vaccines. In total, SII agreed to make up to 200 million vaccine doses for as many as 92 countries, as part of its deal with the Gates Foundation and Gavi, a vaccine alliance. All of that happened, though, before regulators signed off on the AstraZeneca vaccine. Had trials for that vaccine been unsuccessful, SII would \"just be making batches and then end up throwing them away,\" Poonawalla said. A business studies graduate of London's University of Westminster, Poonawalla said SII was able to make that decision more swiftly than many other companies, since it is a family-run business. \"The flexibility of being able to decide on the spot very quickly was really the main game-changer that enabled us to be able to do this,\" said Poonawalla, whose office in India is a refurbished . After the vaccine, Poonawalla began supplying doses to Indians and other other countries. By May, Gavi had received some 30 million jabs from SII. But Poonawalla's plans soon went awry when a second wave of Covid-19 hit India in the spring. At its peak the country was reporting over per day, though say the actual number was likely much higher. At that point, only percent of India's 1.3 billion population was fully vaccinated, and the country's national government had been slow in placing orders for more vaccines. Without a massive stockpile, states in India began to run out of the limited number of jabs they had. India then decided to the export of all vaccines, preventing SII from keeping up with its commitments elsewhere. \"I've always been a patriot for my country ... and if my country needs my facility first, I have to do what they say,\" Poonawalla said. \"There was no two ways about that.\" The inability to export vaccines hurt some of the poorest nations in the world. The director of Africa's disease control body, for example, warned India's hold on exports could be \" \" for the continent. People in several countries, from neighboring Nepal to , were left stranded after receiving the first dose of Covishield, the name of the India-manufactured vaccine. When asked why the global vaccine alliance chose to rely so heavily on one manufacturer, a Gavi spokesperson told CNN Business it had few options. At the start of 2021, \"very few vaccines were approved and available for deployment,\" the spokesperson said, adding that it was \"natural\" that SII would be contracted for early doses given its size. But public health expert Jeffrey Lazarus said there were flaws in the plan. \"Relying on one manufacturer was a mistake, which is easier to see in hindsight,\" said Lazarus, who heads the health systems research group at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health. While Poonawalla cannot be held responsible for some of the issues that led to the vaccine rollout stalling \u2014 chief among them, India's massive outbreak \u2014 his detractors have questioned parts of his approach. They point out Poonawalla hasn't delivered the number of jabs he initially promised, and they claim he hasn't been transparent about how he's been using all of the money he raised for the big vaccine push. \"There isn't much accountability for where the money he raised went,\" Malini Aisola, co-convenor of health sector watchdog All India Drug Action Network, told CNN Business. In June last year, it would make one billion doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine for low and middle income countries, with 400 million doses ready by the end of 2020. But by January 2021, the company had a stockpile of just . His critics weren't impressed, given the amount of capital he raised last year. The global media coverage also turned , with linking the global shortfall in vaccines to SII's problems, including the India export ban and a fire at the company's Pune facility. At the time Poonawalla said the fire had on Covishield production. But he has since saying that the incident has played a major role in hampering manufacturing. He also insists he was realistic about his goals. \"We always underpromise,\" Poonawalla told CNN Business, when asked whether the company pledged more than it could deliver. Still, he's been dogged by other controversies that have dented his reputation. As India's Covid-19 cases were skyrocketing in April, Poonawalla lowered the price of his vaccine and referred to the move as a \" \" \u2014 leading to heavy criticism, with activists pointing out that even a small profit is still a profit for SII. \"AstraZeneca has pledged that it won't from low income and middle income countries during the pandemic, but that does not seem to apply to SII,\" Aisola said. According to AstraZeneca, the companies the drugmaker has sublicensing agreements with, including SII, dictate their own prices. SII declined to comment on how much it has profited from the vaccine efforts so far, but Poonawalla said it is a \"very unreasonable and naive way of looking at the world\" for people to expect companies not to profit from the vaccine. While Poonawalla has yet to match his lofty goals, there is a chance that he and SII can get back on track, which is critical to ending vaccine inequality worldwide. India has decided to begin exporting vaccines once again as its own rate of inoculation increases. The nation had administered doses by October \u2014 about 90% of which came from SII, according to the company. SII also says that it has increased its production to 220 million doses a month as of October. SII is also expanding its partnerships, having signed a deal with American biotech firm Novavax to manufacture its Covid-19 vaccine, which is awaiting regulatory approvals. It's also partnering with the Russian Direct Investment Fund on production of the Sputnik vaccine."},

Bollywood celebrities including Priyanka Chopra, Richa Chadha and Farhan Akhtar are among those to have lambasted the commercial for Layer'r Shot, a brand of male fragrance, calling it \"shameful,\" \"disgusting\" and \"incredibly tasteless.\" Its controversial advert shows four men appearing to stalk a frightened-looking woman in a store before cutting to one of the men saying, \"We're four, there's one, who takes the shot?\" Only when the woman turns round does it become clear they are talking about the body spray -- which one of the men then takes from a store shelf and uses. The commercial caused a storm on social media, where critics including various celebrities blasted its innuendo as making light of rape. Many said the timing of the advert made it particularly insensitive, as it was broadcast just a week after a case in which a 17-year-old was allegedly raped by five men in the southern city of Hyderabad -- against women and minority groups across the country. \"This advertisement is clearly promoting sexual violence against women and girls and promoting a rapist mentality among men. The advertisement is cringeworthy and should not be allowed to be played on mass media,\" wrote Swati Maliwal, chairwoman of the Delhi Commission for Women, to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting on Saturday. Within 24 hours, the ministry had taken the commercial off the air and asked Twitter and YouTube to remove it from their platforms. In an email to Twitter, the ministry said the videos were \"detrimental to the portrayal of women in the interest of decency and morality\" and violated the digital media ethics code. In a statement Monday, Layer'r Shot apologized for the television advertisement, saying it \"never intended to hurt anyone's sentiments or feelings or outrage any woman's modesty or promote any sort of culture, as wrongly perceived by some.\" The brand said it had voluntarily asked all its media partners to stop broadcasting variations of the advertisement from Saturday with immediate effect. Even after the commercial was taken down, it continued to cause a controversy. Actress Richa Chadha was among those registering her disgust, calling the makers of the commercial \"filth.\" \"Creatives, script, agency, client, casting... does everyone think rape is a joke?,\" Chadha tweeted.

More than 4,800 Chinese companies listed in Shanghai, Shenzhen and Beijing have now released their earnings for the first half of the year. It was a bloodbath. As many as 53% posted a decline in net profit, according to data from Wind and Choice, two major financial information services in the country. That was almost as bad as 2020, when companies posted their worst earnings season on record as the country came to a during the initial coronavirus outbreak. Back then, 54% of listed companies saw their profit drop in the first six months. By another measure, though, the start of this year was worse. The number of companies reporting a loss hit a record high of nearly 900 in the first half. In 2020, about 780 lost money. An earnings crash in the world's second largest economy can ripple around the world. That's because Chinese companies are big buyers of commodities, technology and other products on the global market. \"We've already seen the impact,\" said Alicia Garc\u00eda Herrero, chief economist for Asia Pacific at Natixis, a French investment bank. Prices of oil and other energy commodities have retreated and semiconductor factories have started to see decelerating orders, she added. Experts blamed China's strict Covid curbs and a deepening crisis in the property market for the dismal performance of companies. \"The key reasons are mobility restrictions and a huge drop in sentiment associated with the demise of the real estate market,\" said Garc\u00eda-Herrero. Larry Hu, chief China economist for Macquarie Group, said the poor earnings reflected China's slowing economy, which was being dragged back by the real estate slump, the worsening Covid situation, and the weakening global economy. China has so far stuck with its , which often leads to strict restrictions on people's movement and of cities over a few cases. Travel to and from China is also limited. Shanghai, the country's financial hub of 25 million people, was placed under earlier this year. Since then, many other key cities have also tightened curbs on residents and businesses. On Thursday, Chengdu, a city in southwestern Sichuan province, following a spike in Covid cases. China's GDP expanded by just 0.4% in the second quarter from a year ago, the weakest performance since the start of 2020. Last month, several major investment banks slashed their forecasts for China's annual economic growth to 3% or less. Analysts are also concerned about that has swept across southern China recently, which had caused some provinces to shut factories to save power. \"Whether Beijing decides to start easing [zero-Covid policy] from March 2023, we expect the economy and markets to experience a difficult period, as people will be either disappointed about no real opening or be overwhelmed by a surging Covid infection,\" said Nomura analysts in a research report on Friday. China's most prominent tech companies are among those suffering. The second quarter marked an end to years of explosive growth with   for the April-to-June period.   For some other sectors of the economy, this year has already been the worst on record. Three of China's biggest airlines \u2014  ,  , and  \u2014 posted record losses, with a combined loss of 50 billion yuan ($7.2 billion) for the first half. They all blamed travel disruptions because of Covid curbs and a depreciating yuan, which has plunged 9% against the US dollar this year. A weaker currency hurts China's airline industry because it has to pay for imported aircraft, parts and fuel in dollars. The costs of servicing dollar-denominated debt also increases. Property developers are also among the worst performers so far this year, as the country's housing market has spiraled downward. The sector, which accounts for as much as 30% of its GDP, has been crippled by a government campaign since 2020 to rein in reckless borrowing in the industry. Property prices have been falling, as have sales of new homes.

Her decision to invest in digital currencies was met with wariness by her family, she recalls. \"The elders in my family told me not to throw my money away,\" said Daga, who runs a food business near New Delhi. But the 33-year-old hasn't regretted her decision \u2014 bitcoin's value has increased 15 times since then \u2014 and she continues to invest as much as 10% of her savings in cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin and ethereum. \"I find stock markets boring,\" she told CNN Business, adding that she enjoys the \"thrill\" and \"recklessness\" that comes with investing in volatile currencies. She is not the only one. India has seen a huge boom in cryptocurrency trading since the start of the pandemic, even though authorities in Asia's third largest economy have for years expressed concerns about digital currencies, and even Entrepreneurs in the industry told CNN Business that the country has the potential to become a crypto superpower, since it is one of the hottest internet markets in the world, with , and hundreds of millions more yet to come online for the first time. India ranked second behind only Vietnam last year in a list of countries seeing the fastest growth in cryptocurrency adoption, according to a report published in October by blockchain data platform Chainalysis. While the government does not keep estimates of how many people trade cryptocurrencies, industry experts have suggested that the country may now have more than . The growth is driven by younger investors \u2014 mostly under the age of 35 \u2014 and many of them are coming from smaller cities and towns, founders of two of India's biggest crypto exchanges told CNN Business. According to Sumit Gupta, CEO and co-founder of exchange CoinDCX, many Indian millennials have started \"their investing journey with crypto.\" While 20 years ago, their parents chose to invest in gold, these youngsters \"are more interested in having bitcoin as part of their portfolio,\" Gupta told CNN Business, referring to the fact that traditionally Indians chose to park their money in gold or savings accounts. is both an investment and a cultural habit in India, which is one of the largest markets for the precious metal, according to the . It also considered auspicious by Hindus and Jains, and plays a fundamental role in many religious ceremonies. Mumbai-based CoinDCX became India's first crypto unicorn last year, achieving a valuation of $1.1 billion after raising money from investors such as Coinbase Ventures and B Capital Group. The company says 70% of its 10 million users are between the age of 18 and 34. Data shared by rival firm WazirX tell a similar story. WazirX also has over 10 million users, and called 2021 a \" \" for crypto trading in India. The company was acquired by , one of the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchanges, in 2019. Over 65% of its users are under the age of 35, according to a recent company report, and it has seen a \"700% increase in the number of participants from smaller cities like Guwahati, Karnal, Bareilly, thereby signaling the growing interest from rural and semi-urban areas.\" Pritish Kumawat, a crypto trader from a small town in the western state of Rajasthan, said that he now finds conversations about cryptocurrencies in almost every tea shop in his area. Often, the most engaged participants are college students, he said, adding that bitcoin's massive spike last year has fueled the frenzy in India. In November, bitcoin was trading at a record high of , but it has since fallen to around $43,000. In addition to bitcoin, meme currencies such as dogecoin and shiba inu are also popular among Indians, the WazirX report added. Apart from investors from smaller towns, both companies saw an increase of more than 1000% in the number of women users on their platforms, albeit on a small base. Gupta said that participation of crypto by Indian women has seen \"a massive upside\" in the past 18 months and is \"fairly high, fairly healthy, relative to equity markets.\" The company's data shows that 15% of their overall users are women \u2014 which is the as well. The excitement over crypto is rising in India despite the country's on-again, off-again relationship with digital currencies. The central bank has long expressed concerns that cryptocurrencies can be used for money laundering and to finance terrorism. A cryptically worded proposal posted on the Indian parliament website last year even suggested the government was exploring plans to \"prohibit all private cryptocurrencies in India.\" This year, however, started on a more cheerful note for enthusiasts. , the Indian government announced it would impose a 30% tax on income from virtual digital assets, which many industry experts took as a sign that crypto trading won't be banned after all. The government also said it would launch a digital rupee in the coming months. \"Taxation of virtual digital assets or crypto is a step in the right direction. It gives much-needed clarity and confidence to the industry,\" Gupta said at the time of the announcement. Siddharth Menon, the co-founder of WazirX, told CNN Business that following the announcement, his platform saw daily sign-ups jump by over 50%. He also noticed rising interest among Indian developers and other professionals in joining the crypto industry. \"I'm getting LinkedIn messages\" from senior executives in India, who are now more optimistic about the business, he said. In the past, Indian exchanges have struggled to hire and retain experienced people due to the lack of clear regulations. But the Indian government soon put a damper on the mood, by clarifying that the cryptocurrencies are not yet legal in the country. \"I am not doing anything to legalize it or ban it or not legalize it,\" Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in parliament a few days after announcing the tax rate. \"Banning or not banning will come subsequently ... But I will tax because it is a sovereign right.\" \"I think the government is not entirely sure what it wants to do from a policy perspective,\" said Anirudh Rastogi, founder of tech law firm Ikigaw Law, which works with crypto exchanges in India. \"It knows where it wants to land broadly. It wants to find the right balance where it is not disconnected from the global progress in blockchain and other tech, but it wants to also address concerns regarding cryptocurrency.\" Rastogi added that the \"extraordinarily high\" tax on crypto is a short-term fix, which will also acts as a deterrent to many investors. \"This rate is typically used to tax activities that are not considered economically productive, such as lottery,\" he said. \"So this could be an indication that the government wants to make revenue, but it does not see crypto trading as economically productive.\" For equities, India applies a 15% short-term capital gains tax if shares are sold in less than a year, and 10% if sold after a year. Gupta hopes that the government makes up its mind soon. India, with its vast pool of developers and enthusiastic young population, could be a \"superpower in the next five to 10 years,\" in cryptocurrency and blockchain industry, he said. \"What is missing right now is a clear regulatory framework,\" he added."},

There are currently around two jobs available for every unemployed person, and as a result, employers have had to raise wages to attract suitable candidates. That sounds like a good thing \u2014 and it is for Americans who are facing higher prices on everything from groceries to rent. But the Federal Reserve isn't very happy about it. In order to fight inflation, it needs to cool the economy, and larger salaries do the opposite. Higher labor costs can also get passed on by companies to consumers, and that means higher prices. This inflationary cycle \u2014 pay more and then charge more \u2014 is exactly what the Fed wants to squash. That's why it's paying particularly close attention to wage growth, which . If growth had continued to accelerate, the central bank would have more reason to aggressively hike interest rates at its meeting later this month. But we're not out of the woods yet. Wage levels are still elevated for the year, up 5.2%. There are a number of factors that add to higher prices \u2014 including supply chain and commodity pressures \u2014 but wages are the dominant driver of inflation moving forward, Aneta Markowska, chief financial economist at Jefferies, told me. \"Rising wages are creating a significant amount of inflation. Supply chain issues are expected to ease in the next year, but we're still left with this labor problem.\" The only way to get to the Fed's goal of a 2% inflation rate is to see wage growth decelerate sharply, she said. A 0.3% increase isn't enough of a deceleration. The US unemployment rate grew to 3.7% in August, coming in hotter-than-expected. The economy added 315,000 jobs for the month, topping analyst estimates of 300,000 but marking the lowest monthly gain since April 2021. Wage growth also eased to 0.3% for the month. Wall Street had expected a 0.4% increase. The Federal Reserve is looking for red-hot jobs growth to start cooling in its fight to ease inflation. The report lowered market expectations for a more aggressive interest rate hike at the Fed's September meeting, sending stocks higher. The numbers provided some relief from last month's jobs report, which blew expectations out of the water. More than half a million jobs were created, the most in five months. Average hourly earnings grew by half a percent month-over-month. In the weeks following the July jobs release, Fed officials took a more hawkish stance, saying that rate hikes would continue until inflation comes down and warning of upcoming economic \"pain.\" Fed Chair Jerome Powell cited the strong labor market as a cause of inflationary concern at . \"The labor market is particularly strong, but it is clearly out of balance, with demand for workers substantially exceeding the supply of available workers,\" he said. After the last Fed meeting in July, where the central bank raised rates by a whopping 75 basis points, Powell told me that he was closely monitoring wage growth. His ultimate goal, he said, was to bring inflation down and achieve \"a landing that doesn't require a really significant increase in unemployment.\" That's only achieved by slowing wage growth. Wall Street is currently pricing in . That's down nearly 15 percentage points since Thursday, before the jobs report was released. But there's still a lot of ambiguity around the Fed's upcoming policy decision. There's a lot of economic data to digest in the first half of this month -- in particular, inflation numbers for August -- and this is just one piece of a larger puzzle. \"The Fed will require further proof of softening before adjusting policy materially,\" said David Page, head of macro research at AXA Investment Managers. \"But on balance these figures are consistent with a 50-basis point September Fed hike.\" The US and China have finally come to an agreement on one of the biggest problems in global business: How Chinese companies listed on American exchanges should be audited. Regulators from both countries announced a deal last week that would allow US officials to inspect the audit papers of those firms. The breakthrough means that for now, more than 160 Chinese companies may have dodged the immediate threat of being kicked off the world's biggest stock market, . The US is wasting no time in getting started on those audits. Reuters reported Wednesday that officials picked  ,  and other companies for a first round of inspections beginning next month. US regulations stipulate that all companies on American exchanges must comply with requests to fully open their books by 2024 or they will be barred from trading in the United States. That's a problem for China. The country has been hesitant to let overseas regulators inspect its accounting firms, citing security concerns. The tension has already led some Chinese companies to retreat from US markets. Alibaba, whose shares have traded on the NYSE since 2014, outlined plans this summer to upgrade its Hong Kong listing to primary status, which it expects to take place by the end of this year. The long list of companies at risk goes beyond Alibaba and includes some of China's top tech giants like  , and  . The impending audit deadline has already led to a slowdown in share issues. US IPOs by Chinese companies have slumped significantly, with eight so far this year compared to 37 in the same period last year. The value of those deals has also shrunk. So far in 2022, companies have raised just $332 million through IPOs on US markets, down from nearly $13 billion a year ago. This deal is just a first step in formalizing audit protocol between the US and China. It's still unclear if China will actually comply. Last week, SEC chief Gary Gensler warned that companies still faced ejection if their papers could not be accessed by US authorities. \"The proof will be in the pudding,\" he said in a statement. Analysts at Goldman Sachs said this week that there's still a 50% chance of Chinese shares getting delisted. Either way, this isn't likely to have a big impact on other contentious issues standing between the US and China. But it does mean that China needs Wall Street. \"The US-China relationship reminds me of conflict-ridden relationships where at the end of the day, they realize they can't afford to get divorced,\" said Drew Bernstein, co-chairman of Marcum Asia CPAs, an accounting firm for Asian companies looking to enter US markets.

Customers around the world are feeling the pain of higher prices. In the United States, the has risen at some of the fastest rates seen since the 1980s. Historically, when such high bouts of inflation have occurred, recessions and widespread job losses have quickly followed. And, in the past, that has led to \"stagflation\" \u2014 an unpleasant mix of double-digit inflation, declining economic activity and high unemployment. As the odds of a recession in the US grow, what are the risks that history repeats? Our baseline expectation is for the US to enter a recession in 2023. But we don't expect to see the stagflation that we saw in the 1970s and early 1980s. Here's why: We now have two of the three ingredients for stagflation \u2014 high inflation and low or no economic growth \u2014 but we are missing the third: high unemployment. The US labor market is on a tear and shows little sign of contracting, which makes a 1970s-style stagflation scenario far less probable. Consider the following: Much of the labor demand reflects a deep need for certain skills across a range of industries, and the labor supply remains insufficient for the jobs at hand, even with lower growth. Even if firms cut their job openings by 20% and increase layoffs by 20%, the US labor market will still be relatively tight, according to our own analysis. And some firms may be reluctant to let go of workers in this coming recession, fearful that they may not be able to hire them back. A danger of high inflation is that it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, making inflation stubbornly \"sticky.\" When people expect prices to rise even further, they will understandably ask for higher pay. (And during labor shortages, they often get it.) To make up the difference in their profit margins, employers in turn charge higher prices for the goods and services they provide, which in turn leads to demand for higher pay, feeding the wage-price spiral. This is what we saw back in the '70s, with anecdotes of employees negotiating double-digit annual wage increases over three years in anticipation of persistent inflation. That said, although measures of for the next 12 months have risen, most consumers, business leaders and the financial markets don't expect such inflation rates to persist much longer after that, according to and of inflation expectations, which have been steadily falling over the past five months after rising the previous two years. We're in a vastly different world today compared to the '70s. Supply-side issues are improving, inflation seems to already be contracting, and jobs are plentiful. Most important, the Fed has more credibility as an inflation fighter than it did in the '70s. The is aware that its recent aggressive rate hikes are still not restrictive enough when it comes to taming inflation. A lot of energy is spent analyzing the Fed and forecasting its next moves. At , we're no exception. We believe that, although the Fed was late in raising rates last year, it is now intent on bringing down inflation to its 2% target, even if a recession occurs. That likely means raising short-term rates to at least 4% so long as inflation remains well above 2%. No soft landing, but no stagflation either. In 2023, we will likely see lower inflation and declining real gross domestic product for a time. More layoffs will likely occur, and the unemployment rate will rise from its very low 3.7% rate, but perhaps not by that much. My base case has it remaining well below 5%, a \"job-full\" recession compared to the recessions of the past. This certainly does not look like the stagflation of the 1970s. It's clear that the labor market will likely stay strong, even if we end up in a recession."},

Apple has some famously loyal customers. Yet as broader economic forecasts get left and right, it might be a hard time to convince people to upgrade their iPhones. \"Apple faces a real conundrum of pricing,\" said Ben Wood, chief analyst at market research firm CCS Insight. On top of inflation and cost-of-living pressures wreaking havoc on consumers, he noted that Apple simultaneously faces rising costs associated with iPhone components and transportation. \"My expectation is that Apple will probably have to nudge prices up,\" Wood told CNN Business. But given the strain consumers are facing, he thinks Apple will also do \"everything they can to make that as minimal as possible.\" Beyond the broader signals of a worsening economy, Apple is also facing other headwinds as it prepares for the product launch next week. Supply chain hiccups stemming from China's zero-Covid policy were partly linked to the company's reported last month. Apple CEO Tim Cook said on the earnings call, however, that there was \"no obvious evidence of macroeconomic impact\" to iPhone sales. Cook added that the company even set a third-quarter record \"for both revenue and switchers to iPhone,\" adding that \"customers continue to find that iPhone remains the gold standard for smartphones.\" Steadfast iPhone sales are linked in part to other the predictions from some industry insiders that Apple will hike up the price of its newest iPhones -- though it is difficult to predict by just how much. Ming-Chi Kuo, an influential Apple analyst based in Asia, earlier this month that he expects Apple to raise the average selling price of the iPhone 14 lineup by some 15% compared to the iPhone 13 lineup. (Currently, the regular, non-mini, iPhone 13 starts at $799, the iPhone 13 Pro starts at $999 and the iPhone 13 Pro Max starts at $1,099.) In a research note Monday, analysts Dan Ives and John Katsingris of Wedbush Securities predicted that Apple would raise the price of its newest higher-end models by some $100. \"We believe a $100 price increase on the iPhone 14 Pro/Pro Max is likely in store given component price increases as well as added functionality on this new release,\" the note stated. The cameras on the upcoming iPhone Pro models are rumored to be upgraded to possibly justify the price increase, among other enhancements. The Wedbush analysts also predicted strong underlying demand for the next iPhone, estimating that some 240 million out of 1 billion iPhone users worldwide have not upgraded their phones in over three and a half years. Wood also noted that Apple's iPhones are in some ways insulated from macroeconomic pressures. Consumers are also increasingly looking at smartphones as \"almost essential,\" compared to some other tech gadgets. \"Whether you really need an iPhone or not, that's open to questions, but people who have an iPhone already are unbelievably loyal,\" Wood said. \"I think that Apple has some advantages over rivals,\" he added. \"There are people who are always waiting for a new iPhone.\" Apple, in its famously tight-lipped fashion during the the lead-up to its product launches, did not respond to CNN Business' request for comment Monday on the latest iPhone prices. The company sent out invites last week for its September 7 event, which has been cryptically dubbed: \"Far out.\" The event will be broadcast on Apple's website from the company's Cupertino, California, headquarters starting at 1 p.m. ET."},

Traders don't have a crystal ball to measure the level of risk when they make investment decisions. Instead they depend on the VIX, or the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index. Known as Wall Street's \"fear gauge,\" the index is supposed to reflect the market's estimate of future volatility \u2014 or how fast prices will change \u2014 30 days out. An elevated VIX means increased fear and risk while a low VIX means the market is entering a less stressful period. That's why the VIX tends to move in the opposite direction of the market. But as investors churn through increasingly choppy markets, some analysts are worried that this trusted measure of forecasting is broken. The gauge, they say, doesn't work in an atmosphere heavy with uncertainty, which is when traders most need it. The VIX is worthless in forecasting the direction of stocks, Aaron Anderson, senior vice president of research at Fisher Investments told me. \"There's just no correlation to future returns. We've never understood why so many people accredit so much to the VIX.\" Markets have tumbled over the last four days, bringing the recent late-summer comeback into doubt. The VIX is just now catching up to that, and only sort of. : Thirty is considered a high benchmark for the VIX. The index floated around 20 and below \u2014 which would indicate less volatility \u2014 for most of August. It hit 25 on Wednesday. In theory, if the index were to predict future market moves, it would have risen that high ahead of last week's selloff, Scott Bauer, CEO of Prosper Trading Academy who worked for 15 years as a market maker at the CBOE, told me. Cliff Asness of AQR Capital Management agrees that the index has limited utility: \"The VIX tells us almost nothing beyond how much markets have been bouncing around lately \" In an analysis dating back to the 1990s he found that the VIX was essentially in line with the S&P 500. By the time an investor looks back and determines a VIX peak or trough, said analysts at Fisher Investments, they've likely already missed the corresponding turn in the S&P 500. Sometimes there isn't any connection at all. Fisher analysts pointed to 1995 \u2014 a stellar year for markets that had no correlation to the VIX. The index wasn't designed to be as useful to retail investors as it is for institutions, said Bauer. There's a whole cottage industry of derivatives built off it. When the CBOE first created the VIX in 1992, it was intended to be a way for traders to make money by predicting market volatility. It wasn't supposed to become the major fear gauge it is today. In uncertain times, we like to cling to any future reassurances that we can, and the financial media certainly likes to use the VIX to that end. But when the unknowns are unknown, the VIX tends to break down.  had a very bad Wednesday. The company announced that it will lay off about 20% of corporate employees, close around 150 stores and slash several of its in-house home goods' brands in a bid to rescue itself from bankruptcy, . The retailer announced that it had also managed to secure more than $500 million in financing to shore up its long-term financial problems. The stock closed down more than 20% lower on the news. That's a big shift from recent weeks when the long-ailing company was adopted by so-called meme investors, who use social media platforms to organize large-scale stock purchases. The meme-induced hype lifted Bed Bath and Beyond's shares from less than $5 at the beginning of August to more than $30 during the middle of the month. It's been volatile since then. Shares of BBBY have either been the best or worst-performing stock in the S&P 1500 on nine out of the last 12 trading days, according to an analysis by Bespoke Investment group. Over on Reddit, meme investors who frequent pages like WallStreetBets appeared confused about what to do next. Some begged fellow Redditors to hold the stock, while others said it was time to let go. But it appears that even meme investors eventually got pulled down with the sinking ship. The company's moves on Wednesday were the \"prototypical rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic,\" said Berna Barshay, an independent retail analyst. The business, she added, is in structural decline. There is one thing investors can be certain of in this increasingly chaotic economic climate: People love to drink. The bourbon boom is showing no signs of ending anytime soon, Jack Daniel's owner Brown-Forman reported quarterly results Wednesday morning that easily topped analysts' forecasts.

The Facebook/Instagram/Messenger/WhatsApp owner could potentially get a further boost to its video aspirations by adding Zoom. How about  ? There's an argument to be made to combine Zoom with Slack, which Salesforce agreed to for nearly $28 billion, to create an uber-workplace productivity app that could compete even more effectively with Microsoft's Teams. The major obstacle to any deal could be Zoom's price. Joseph Bonner of Argus noted that although Zoom shares are well off their pandemic peaks, the company still would be tough to swallow \u2014 even for a megacap tech with tons of cash. \"A Zoom acquisition is unlikely due to a number of factors,\" Bonner said in an email. \"The thesis in favor of acquisition would be to pick up the asset on the cheap since it's lost so much value in the past year. Still at a $24 billion market cap, it's not that cheap and an acquisition premium would push that toward $30 billion or more.\" Bonner thinks that price tag would likely scare off any big tech buyers, as would the possibility of any potential deal getting a tough review from regulators in Washington. However, Bonner said there's a chance that Zoom could be bought by an investment firm so that it would no longer be subject to the quarterly earnings report whims of Wall Street. \"Think private equity. That could be a possibility,\" Bonner said. Others point out that Zoom is hardly the only tech/software company that is dealing with a post-Covid hangover. The Nasdaq has plummeted due to worries about rising interest rates and recession fears as well. \"I don't think it's accurate to say Zoom is uniquely struggling right now,\" said Morningstar analyst Dan Romanoff in an email. \"All of software has been battered over the last 10 months.\" Romanoff added that Zoom is \"an innovative company with a great product.\" The problem, he said, is that at the height of the pandemic, Zoom was \"generating an unsustainable revenue trajectory\" and the stock was \"sharply overvalued.\" That said, a deal could be possible. Romanoff noted that a Slack-Zoom combination could make sense. \"I thought a couple years ago that Slack and Zoom should merge because there is no need for standalone video, phone, and messaging products,\" Romanoff said. But he's not sure Salesforce would want to buy Zoom after already paying up for Slack, noting that Salesforce has \"maintained that [it is] not looking to do further large deals at this time.\" There is one other possible wild card though Business software company Oracle. \"Oracle doesn't have anything like this in their portfolio and they have been serial acquirers over the years,\" Romanoff said. But he still thinks an  deal for Zoom is highly unlikely because he's \"not sure that their balance sheet would allow them to do such a deal or that they are in the market at all.\" Romanoff added that if any tech company wanted to make a bigger bet on video, a cheaper way to do so would be with communications software firm  , which has a market value of just a little more than $4 billion. Zoom could also look to go back out and make a deal of its own if market conditions improve. That could help the company diversify. \"I am in the camp that Zoom is more likely to be an acquirer than an acquiree at this point,\" said James Fish, an analyst with Piper Sandler. Zoom had actually hoped to make a big purchase recently when it cloud call contact software firm  in July 2021. But Zoom called off the deal just two months later, and CEO Yuan said that \"financial discipline is foundational to our strategy.\""},

The nation's unemployment rate rose to 3.7% from 3.5%, as more people entered the labor market looking for work, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday. The labor force participation rate ticked up by 0.3 percentage points to 62.4% but still remains below the pre-pandemic level of 63.4%. The August jobs report is among the key economic data the Federal Reserve will review when it meets later this month to decide how much to ratchet up its benchmark interest rate in order to stifle stubbornly high inflation. Thus far, the Fed has been battling soaring inflation While the economy is slowing and certain industries such as housing are showing softening amid a series of hefty rate hikes, the labor market has remained strong \u2014 a little too strong for the Fed's liking. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell the labor market is \"clearly out of balance, with demand for workers substantially exceeding the supply of available workers.\" Earlier this week, as the number of job openings hit 11.2 million in July, an increase of 700,000 from June, according to a separate report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Jim McCoy, senior vice president at staffing firm Manpower Group, characterized the current labor market as the eye of an \"economic hurricane.\" \"We have a calm center and lots of conflicting factors swirling around,\" he said. \"But effectively what we're seeing is that in spite of rising rates and supply chain issues that continue to plague [businesses], the jobs market is robust. There's a lot of pent-up demand for employees.\" Some of the biggest monthly employment gains in August came from professional and business services as well as the health care sector, which saw employment increase by 68,000, and 48,000 positions, respectively. The US economy has added an average of 438,000 jobs per month so far this year, after factoring in revisions that lowered June and July's employment gains by 107,000 jobs. \"I think it's reasonable to expect that we will not keep that pace up between now and the end of the year,\" said Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate. \"I think that we may well have seen the low for unemployment during this cycle.\" The average monthly job gains are robust, compared to pre-pandemic times when the monthly average was around 200,000, BLS data shows. But even the slower pace of August's increase would be considered acceptable to the Fed, said Brian Bethune, an economics professor at Boston College. \"I don't think the Fed wants to see things suddenly decelerate, nor do they want to see things move at too rapid of a rate for the economy to adjust,\" he said. \"What the Fed wants is the Goldilocks economy. They want it to be moving along at a steady pace \u2014 but not too fast; not too hot, not too cold.\" The strong labor market and job gains shouldn't be viewed as a net negative, Bethune said, noting that adding workers helps to ease supply-side constraints in goods and services. \"If the Fed goes and drives through the stop sign [by overcorrecting and spurring a recession], and we get a reduction in employment as a result, then we're going to get a reduction in supply \u2014 really not the right path to go at all,\" he said. This is the second jobs report released since the end of July, when the Fed's rate hike committee last met. Powell said last week that the central bank's decision in September will depend on the \"totality of the data and the evolving outlook.\" Among the biggest reports to land in the weeks to come will be the Consumer Price Index and Producer Price Index, which could help show the direction of inflation. The Fed is also closely monitoring wage growth, with Powell previously expressing concerns that continued gains could keep inflation elevated. Wage gains continue to be outpaced by the rate of inflation, The August report showed that the pace of average hourly earnings increased at a slower pace of 0.3% from July. That's the lowest rate of increase since April, for an annual growth of 5.2%. \"This is, no doubt, a welcome development for the Fed, but we shouldn't see this as a sign of an imminent Fed pivot toward looser monetary policy,\" Gregory Daco, chief economist for EY, wrote in a note Friday. Daco said that \"barring a surprisingly strong CPI\" reading, he anticipates the Fed will institute a 50 basis point increase at its meeting later this month."},

The crash occurred after the Cruise robotaxi making a left turn stopped in the intersection, thinking that an oncoming vehicle would turn in front of it. But the oncoming vehicle instead drove straight, striking the Cruise vehicle. Both the San Francisco police department and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration launched investigations. Cruise has said that the oncoming vehicle drove in the right-turn lane and was traveling at \"approximately 40 mph\" in a 25-mph lane before it exited the lane and proceeded forward. Cruise acknowledged in its recall filing that its robotaxi was not \"sufficiently reactive.\" Cruise spokeswoman Hannah Lindow declined to say what the Cruise vehicle could have done differently, and declined to release video of the crash. Nevertheless, Cruise said in a statement that it made the recall \"in the interest of transparency to the public.\" Cruise said in a document detailing the recall that it has already issued a software update that it says improves the robotaxis' ability to predict what other vehicles will do, including in conditions similar to the crash. Tesla, arguably a Cruise competitor in the long-term, has been criticized in the past for making software updates to its vehicles while not always issuing a recall. NHTSA has been more proactive on recalls of late and in a 12-day span earlier this year. Software updates like what Cruise did, often called \"over-the-air-updates,\" are generally to companies in the way traditional recalls have been, because there aren't costs for physical parts and the labor to install them. \"Automated driving developers are constantly revising their software, including to address potential safety issues,\" Bryant Walker Smith, a professor at the University of South Carolina law school who researchers autonomous vehicles, told CNN Business. \"It's to the company's credit that they treated this particular safety-relevant update as a recall under federal law.\" Cruise continued to operate its robotaxi service in San Francisco following the crash. But at some point after the crash, which Cruise didn't disclose, it disabled its vehicles' ability to make unprotected left turns and reduced the area where its robotaxis operated. Cruise has gradually reintroduce unprotected left turns since making the software update on July 6. An unprotected left turn is a turn where there is not a left-turn signal that indicates when it's a vehicles' opportunity to go. Unprotected left turns are generally considered one of the more challenging things that a fully autonomous vehicle performs. Waymo's robotaxis in Arizona, for example, to help minimize risks. Cruise became the second company to offer a fully autonomous ridehail service when it launched in San Francisco in February, but only during The collision that led to the recall occurred at 11 pm, according to Cruise's report filed to the California Department of Motor Vehicles. Cruise's robotaxis   but also have had shortcoming, including technical glitches and flaws like blocking a firetruck responding to a multi-alarm fire this April, according to the San Francisco Fire Department. Photos have of a group of Cruise vehicles blocking lanes on a San Francisco street. Developing and operating robotaxis is extremely difficult and expensive. Cruise has added shareholders in addition to GM, including Honda, Microsoft and Walmart. Cruise lost $500 million in the second quarter of this year, according to GM financial filings. GM CEO Mary Barra that the market for robotaxis would probably be several billion dollars once robotaxis rides were available for $1 per mile, cheaper than human-driven Uber and Lyft's, which are often several dollars per mile and sometimes more. \"It's very much going to be a big part of how we move from point A to point B because it's safer,\" Barra told Fox Business. NHTSA has no performance standards for fully autonomous vehicles like Cruise's, but has said it will pursue recalls as needed."},
{"url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2022/09/01/business/nightcap-inflation-jobs-report-twitter-edit/index.html", "title": "What the Fed talks about when it talks about pain ", "paragraphs": " Friday morning, economists and investors everywhere will be focused on one document, the US August jobs report, for a read on how the world's biggest economy is faring. Fed officials, in particular, will be watching closely, as it is one of the last major economic data releases they'll have before their mid-September policy meeting. Here's what you need to know: Hold up \u2014 the Fed wants job growth? Seems counterintuitive, but, yeah. The Fed has a dual mandate to ensure maximum employment (which we have) and price stability (which we definitely don't have). And as Chairman Jay Powell reminded the world so bluntly in Jackson Hole last week, the Fed is going to keep raising interest rates (which makes borrowing more expensive, slowing business activity) until inflation relents. It's a long road ahead: Price surges are hovering around a 40-year high of 8.5%. The Fed wants to get that down to 2%. In effect, the Fed is wagering that the resulting pain of unemployment is less broadly harmful than the pain of inflation. Key quote: \"Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone.\" Of course, not everyone agrees with the Fed's strategy. Much of the root cause of inflation \u2014 supply chain disruptions, the pandemic, geopolitical tensions \u2014 are well out of the central bank's jurisdiction. Raising interest rates tackles the demand side (consumers will buy less) rather than addressing the supply side. \"What [Powell] calls 'some pain,' means putting people out of work, shutting down small businesses because the cost of money goes up,\" Senator Elizabeth Warren told CNN's Dana Bash last weekend. She's not wrong. Powell often euphemistically calls it \"softening of labor market conditions.\" What he means is higher unemployment, which means less consumer spending, which brings prices down. The Fed's trying to trade one kind of pain (inflation) for another kind of pain (unemployment). But Powell has repeatedly said that the labor market's strength is evidence the economy can handle higher rates. Of course, that's little consolation to the people whose jobs end up on the chopping block. A third three-quarter-point hike isn't a foregone conclusion. The Fed will have to weigh tomorrow's jobs numbers along with the results of the consumer price index, due out a week before the central bank's Sept. 21 meeting, to get a clearer view of the inflation puzzle. At least are on strike, including rail workers, lawyers, journalists and postal service staff, demanding higher pay as inflation soars to its highest level in decades. It's one of the most significant waves of industrial unrest in the UK since the \"winter of discontent\" in the late 1970s, when rampant inflation pushed workers to stage mass walkouts. Now for some not-terrible and relatively Musk-free news from Twitter, as a treat. It only took 800 years of pleading and begging but the Twitter gods have finally granted the world's request for a freakin' edit button. \"This is happening and you'll be okay,\" the company tweeted. (Ahem, AP style on that would be \"OK,\" instead of \"okay,\" plus it saves two whole characters! See, Twitter, everyone needs an editor.) This isn't a huge surprise \u2014 Twitter teased at it back in April, on the same day it announced Elon Musk would join its board (lol). (ICYMI, Musk accepted the board seat, then bailed a few days later. And then he offered to buy Twitter outright. And now he's in court trying to bail on that. Are you sensing a pattern?) The lack of an edit button has been an issue for as long as Twitter's been around. Facebook and Instagram have had it for years. Why, oh why, Twitter, did you make me suffer the public shame of my own misspellings and general carelessness? Apparently, some people worried about how editing could be weaponized, Like, say a harmless tweet goes viral and then gets edited to include harassment or misinformation? (To which I say, if you've ever to make a tweet go viral, you know how unlikely this scenario is. But I digress...) To avoid that misinformation potential, Twitter said tweets will be able to be edited \"a few times\" for up to 30 minutes after they are first posted. Edited tweets will appear with an icon, label and timestamp to make it obvious they have been modified, and users can click through to a tweet's \"edit history\" to see past versions. Good idea. Not to miss out on this trend, starting next week, Nightcap subscribers will get a version of the newsletter in which you can read all my terrible jokes and discarded takes that I cycle through every day to emerge with this still-imperfect-and-not-always-typo-free product.

Air travel has been slow to adopt clean energy, but while the next generation of aviators waits for commercial airlines to move away from fossil fuels, it doesn't mean they can't train with lower carbon emissions. The Velis Electro, the world's only electric plane fully certified and , is taking off as a greener option for trainee pilots. Manufactured in Slovenia by Pipistrel, the Velis Electro is a two-seater light aircraft designed for flight schools. The single-engine aircraft can fly up to and has a maximum speed of (113 mph). It has a flight time of around 50 minutes (plus reserve) per charge, with two batteries that take to completely recharge. Tine Toma\u017ei\u010d, chief technology officer at Pipistrel Slovenia, says that while the Velis Electro offers a range of advantages over regular aircraft, a key attraction is that many of the fundamentals remain the same. \"You can literally take this airplane home and use it from day one for whatever you were using other non-electric powered airplanes for before,\" he tells CNN Business. As well as producing no carbon emissions in the air, the airplane is quiet \u2014 around says Pipistrel, which is . Toma\u017ei\u010d says that as a result, it can fly at much smaller airfields \u2014 which are often nearer to built-up areas and closer to prospective pilots \u2014 without annoying nearby residents. Since it was launched in 2020, Pipistrel says it has sold around 100 of the electric planes, priced at \u20ac175,000 ($175,500). With surging gasoline prices and increased scrutiny of the carbon footprint of air travel there is growing interest in the segment. in northern Sweden has three Velis Electros as part of its private and commercial pilot license training programs, which use sustainably powered planes where possible. Around 30% of the flying hours required for a commercial pilot's license take place in the electric aircraft, Johan Norberg, head of flight training at the academy, tells CNN. There is \"a huge difference\" in operational energy cost, he says, estimating a 40-minute flight in the Velis Electro uses $2 to $3 of renewable electricity, compared to roughly $45 of aviation gasoline for the same flight in a traditional single-engine training aircraft, like a Cessna 172, using a Lycoming O-360 engine. Pipistrel says batteries need to be replaced after around 2,000 flight hours (an indicator on the batteries says exactly when) and the price for a new pair is approximately $20,000. Even with the cost of replacing batteries, Norberg estimates the electric aircraft is cheaper to run than the academy's diesel counterpart, although he adds that \"the long-term operational costs are still to be verified.\" Training for a private pilot's license costs ($14,500) at Green Flight Academy, about the same as at flight schools that use conventional aircraft. \"When we can do a larger portion of training in electric airplanes there will be a significant cost cut to the whole training program,\" explains Norberg. In addition to shorter flights, qualifying for a private license requires pilots to undertake two-hour flights, says Norberg, which aren't currently possibly in the Velis Electro. But developing the next generation of electric aircraft with longer flight times could mean that within a few years, pilots might be able to train entirely without burning fossil fuel. Pipistrel was acquired this year by American conglomerate (owner of the Cessna and Lycoming brands), and is now part of . The global electric aircraft market is expected to quadruple , according to market research firm Precedence Research -- which estimates the value could reach nearly $40 billion by the end of the decade. The Velis Electro is currently awaiting approval for commercial use in the US by the Federal Aviation Administration, but it is already being flown privately. While trainee pilots are now getting the opportunity to fly green, large aircraft have yet to be weaned off fossil fuels, and zero-carbon long-haul and cargo flight is a way off. But Toma\u017ei\u010d is hopeful that won't always be the case. \"What (the) Velis Electro is already doing today is training the generation of pilots who will fly these large green aviation products of the future,\" he says. \"Not only is it representing a change in technology applied to training, but it is definitely changing the mindset of future pilots who inevitably will want to fly cleaner, electrified airplanes as part of their pilot careers.\""},

On Friday, the government boosted its permanent migration numbers to 195,000 from this financial year -- a rise of 35,000 people. Employers are hopeful they'll help fill gaps in the workforce, but with almost half a million vacancies across the country and an unemployment rate of 3.4%, a near 50-year low, many more are needed. The problem isn't only related to the Covid-19 border closures -- experts say the visa system was struggling even before the pandemic. \"I think the biggest issue at the moment is actually getting people into the country regardless of what the cap is,\" said Blair Chapman, director of Deloitte Access Economics. \"We're really competing on a global scale now with shortages reported all across the world and there needs to be serious thought given to how we actually attract people to Australia.\" Part of the problem is that hundreds of thousands of people are waiting for their visa applications to be processed, creating a disincentive for new highly skilled applicants who may have offers elsewhere. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says his new Labor government inherited a backlog of one million visa applications that officials are working to clear. \"Many of those (are) employees or potential employees who had agreements with employers for jobs ... and they have been waiting,\" he told CNN affiliate Seven news. At a jobs summit in Canberra, he committed 36 million Australian dollars ($24 million) to clear the backlog, but experts say the government could find itself in the same position as employers -- having too few workers to do the job. When the first cases of coronavirus were detected in early 2020, Australia shut its borders, restricting access to international arrivals so numbers didn't exceed the availability of hotel quarantine. Now, almost all Covid-19 restrictions have disappeared and from this week, positive cases only need to isolate at home for five days rather than seven. Australians barred from leaving the country are now racing for the border, and while more international visitors are arriving, the The lack of migration has created headaches for businesses -- forcing some to reduce their hours or services. Farmers can't find enough workers to pick their crops, hospital staff are working overtime, and construction workers are stretched thin across multiple work sites. \"It's across the board,\" said Zahan Mistry, the director of Easymigrate, a company offering migration and visa services. \"We're looking for people in IT, people in hospitality, in professional services, childcare workers, aged care workers, construction.\" Natureworks director David Joffe wants at least 10 workers for his sculpting business on the outskirts of Brisbane. \"Right now we're about to sculpt a giant 12-meter high cockatoo,\" Joffe said. \"We would love to build some horses here because we need some for Melbourne Cup day. There's also the lifecycle of a frog -- a series of 15 molds out there that we should be casting.\" But there just aren't enough people around to do the work. \"There are a couple of German backpackers living at Mount Glorious,\" he said. \"(But) everybody is grabbing them to try to get them to work on their house,\" he said. \"I'd love to get them, too, but they're busy.\" On the surface, Australia seems to be a strong option for skilled workers eager to relocate. The country's economy has rebounded from the pandemic and though the cost of living is rising, at 6.1% inflation is still lower than in the United Kingdom and the United States. Experts say Australia should be able to compete with Canada and New Zealand when it comes to skilled workers, but it doesn't. Australia's immigration policies are notoriously tough, but Mistry from Easymigrate said even for people with highly sought-after skills, the visa system can be frustratingly slow. \"It could take sort of eight to 12 months to bring someone in, so it becomes a big disincentive to businesses who are kind of looking for someone to start immediately,\" he said. Partner visas can take up to two years, he added. Mistry said the problems predate the pandemic, going back five years or so to when Border Force, the agency tasked with border control, was absorbed into a larger Department of Home Affairs. \"It seems to have been a very big culture shift from being about facilitating visas to one of more border protection,\" Mistry said. Australia's former Deputy Immigration Minister Abul Rizvi said around that time it became much harder for Australian employers to recruit foreign workers. \"What we did was make employer sponsored visas much, much, much more bureaucratic and made the processing of them very slow,\" he said. Rizvi said Friday's lift in permanent migrant numbers is positive, but it'll take time for the benefit to flow into the market. He said a sharp rise in student visa numbers could help fill vacancies in the short-term -- students have full work rights -- but he said in the long-term the country is \"going down the wrong path.\" \"We need to be selecting students who are interested in studying seriously and are able to study seriously, to complete a course employers value, and we'll give them a skilled job and a pathway to permanent residence. That's how the system works best,\" he said. \"At the moment, we're being sold by education agents around the world as the cheap work visa -- if you want to seriously study you go somewhere else.\" He said international students on low quality courses could find themselves stuck without a permanent path to migration because their qualifications aren't attractive to employers. On top of that, he said the processing system needs to get much faster. \"If you've got the world's best quantum physicist, you don't want to mess them around for two years. You want to get them quickly before somebody else grabs them.\""},

Four of those six were linked to the Russian state-owned energy giant or one of its subsidiaries, while the other two were associated with Lukoil, Russia's largest privately owned oil and gas company. Earlier this year, the company took the unusual public stance of speaking out against Russia's war in Ukraine, calling for sympathy for the victims, and for the end of the conflict. Lukoil's chairman Ravil Maganov died this week after falling out of the window of a hospital in Moscow, according to Russian state news agency TASS. Lukoil confirmed the death on Thursday in a statement published on its website. Maganov \"passed away following a severe illness,\" Lukoil said, making no mention of a fall. \"Maganov immensely contributed to the development of not only the company, but of the entire Russian oil and gas sector.\" Another top Lukoil manager, Alexander Subbotin, was found dead near Moscow in May after reportedly visiting a shaman, TASS reported. Russia's State News Agency quoted an official as saying authorities were called to an unconscious man suffering from a heart failure. TASS reported the police opened a criminal investigation into the case. In the first of the deaths reported this year, a top executive at Gazprom was found dead in his cottage in the village of Leninsky near Leningrad on January 30, 2022, according to Russian state media outlet RIA Novosti. RIA reported that a suicide note was found at the scene and that the investigators were investigating the death as a suicide. Russian national broadcaster RenTv has identified the man as Leonid Shulman, the head of transport at Gazprom Invest. Just a month after that, another top executive at Gazprom was found dead in the same village. Alexander Tyulakov was discovered dead in his garage on February 25, according to Novaya Gazeta, an independent Russian newspaper. Novaya Gazeta reported he died by suicide. CNN's calls to Gazprom have not been returned. CNN has asked Russia's Investigative Committee for comment on the two cases but has not received a response. Two more Russian businessmen with links to Gazprom died in apparent murder-suicide incidents in April. One of them, Vladislav Avayev, the former vice-president of Gazprombank, was found dead with his wife and daughter in his Moscow apartment on April 18, according to TASS. Citing a source in law enforcement, TASS claimed authorities were investigating the Avayevs' deaths as a murder-suicide. Yulia Ivanova, a representative of the Investigative Committee for Moscow, was quoted by Tass as saying that a relative discovered the Avayevs' bodies after being told by the family driver and the nanny that they could not contact them on the phone or get into the apartment, since the door was closed from the inside. Igor Volobuev, a former VP of Gazprombank who recently left Russia for Ukraine, told CNN that he did not believe Avayev killed himself. \"His job was to deal with private banking, that means dealing with VIP clients. He was in charge of very large amounts of money. So, did he kill himself? I don't think so. I think he knew something and that he posed some sort of risk,\" Volobuev told CNN in April. Russia's Investigative Committee did not respond to CNN's request for comment on this case. Just a day later, on April 19, Sergey Protosenya, a former executive at the gas producer Novatek, which is partially owned by Gazprom, was found dead at his home in Lloret de Mar, a Mediterranean resort near Barcelona. The bodies of his wife and daughter, showing signs of having suffered violence, were found inside the family's luxury home, an official source close to the investigation told CNN last week, while the body of Protosenya was found in the garden outside, according to the source. Catalan police in the province of Girona, where the town of Lloret de Mar is located, told CNN on Friday that they have since completed their investigation into the case and sent the findings to a court. The police force said its conclusion was that the deaths were a double murder and subsequent suicide. Speaking to the Daily Mail in April, Protosenya's son questioned that version of events, suggesting instead that his father was murdered. \"The Catalan police have taken statements from the son. Other hypotheses have been ruled out. Also ruled out was a triple homicide,\" the police's press official told CNN at that time. \"That this was the work of the Russian mafia? Well, no,\" the official added. Novatek, Protosenya's former employer, said he was \"a wonderful person and a wonderful family man.\" \"Unfortunately, there have been speculations on this topic in the media, but we are convinced that these speculations are not related to reality. We hope that the law enforcement agencies of Spain will conduct a thorough and objective investigation and sort out what happened, \" the company said in a statement. Mikhail Watford, a Ukrainian-born Russian oil and gas billionaire, was found dead in his home in Surrey, England on February 28. Surrey Police told CNN it did not believe there were any suspicious circumstances. Another Russian businessman, Vasily Melnikov, was found dead alongside his family in Nizhny Novgorod in late March, according to the Russian newspaper Kommersant. Melnikov owned MedStom, a medical supplies company. According to Russia's Investigative Committee, a 43-year-old man, his wife, 41, and two children aged four and 10 were found stabbed to death on March 23. The committee did not name Melnikov, but the ages of the dead and the location of the incident match the Kommersant report.

In April's closely watched election, warehouse workers at the Staten Island facility known as JFK8 voted to form the first US union in Amazon's 27-year history \u2014 a stunning win for a newly established organization composed of current and former warehouse employees.

Amazon also alleged the NLRB didn't properly staff the polls during the election, creating \"chaos and hours-long lines to vote on the first polling day, discouraging other employees from voting.\" Amazon's objections were roundly rejected in Thursday's recommendation from the NLRB hearing officer. Amazon will appeal the finding. The hearing officer, who works with a different NLRB office than the one Amazon accused, found Amazon had not proved that the NLRB, the union or any third party \"engaged in objectionable conduct affecting the results of the election.\" \"While we're still reviewing the decision, we strongly disagree with the conclusion,\" said Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel. \"As we showed throughout the hearing with dozens of witnesses and hundreds of pages of documents, both the NLRB and the ALU improperly influenced the outcome of the election and we don't believe it represents what the majority of our team wants.\" Amazon also argued the NLRB should have more quickly investigated what it said were \"frivolous\" unfair labor practice charges made and \"exploited\" by the union. The company also alleged the union supporters intimidated employees and \"threatened violence against its detractors.\" \"We believe that the actions of the NLRB and the ALU improperly suppressed and influenced the vote, and we think the election should be conducted again so that a fair and broadly representative vote can be had,\" Kelly said at the time the objections were filed a week after the April vote.

They have occurred in all 50 states and have been spotted throughout the year. While they are most common in the United States, tornadoes can occur all over the globe. While great strides have been made in the study of tornadoes, there's still so much we don't know about them. They have been studied immensely during the last few decades to learn what causes them and how they form. CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller, who is also a storm chaser, has been following and studying these storms since 2005. \"Something you learn from studying tornadoes, especially in the field, is that there is no perfect formula for forming a tornado -- every storm is unique,\" says Miller. \"Sometimes, it may appear that a storm is in a perfect environment for a tornado to form, yet it never does. Conversely, tornadoes frequently form in marginal environments where it seems like one or more 'ingredients' to storm formation is missing or lacking,\" says Miller. While there's no perfect formula as to which storms will produce tornadoes, there's commonality in the anatomy of the systems that result in tornadoes. There are even signs you can see that will help you understand the life cycle of a developing storm that could produce a tornado. As warm air rises, clouds begin to grow taller and taller. This is the developing phase of the thunderstorm. You can see fluffy white cumulus clouds grow taller with your own eyes. This is before you see rain or hear thunder. As the clouds grow, you will notice the bottom of the cloud darkening. You will many times see the very top of the cloud flattening out, creating an anvil shape that protrudes from the top of the cloud. This indicates very cold air at the top of the cloud and could be a precursor to the possibility of hail. As the storm matures, it could become what's known as a supercell. A supercell is a rotating thunderstorm. \"Nearly all supercells produce some sort of severe weather (large hail or damaging winds) but only 30 percent or less produce tornadoes,\" says the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. During this mature phase of the thunderstorm or supercell; heavy rain, lightning, hail and very strong winds are expected. Sometimes, you will feel a strong gust of wind a few moments before the rain arrives. This is called a gust front. This is caused by cool air being forced down from the storm cloud. When the cold air hits the ground, it spreads out quickly, ahead of the storm. This is a sure sign that a storm is near. Tornadoes are usually formed from supercells. These supercells develop when there are several ingredients in place to help them thrive: instability, lift and wind shear. Within the supercell, wind shear becomes a crucial component to the storms development. Shear is when winds change directions with height. This creates spin within the thunderstorm cloud. Another force that's acting inside the supercel is a downdraft. This is an area of drier air that is pushed down from the storm. As it's forced down, it wraps around the backside of the storm. The updrafts and downdrafts work in tandem to pull the horizontal column of air down to form the tornado. This vertical column of air is called a funnel cloud until it touches the ground -- at that point it becomes a tornado. \"The most telltale sign that a tornado could be forming, when you are looking at a close-range severe thunderstorm, is the 'wall cloud,'\" says Miller. The wall cloud is a lowering of the cloud base that will lead to the vortex, or spinning of air. When this rotating column of air touches the ground, a tornado has formed. The presence of a wall cloud doesn't always mean a tornado will form, but it certainly ups the odds. \"You will know you are looking at a wall cloud because it will hang noticeably lower than the rest of the thunderstorm and you may notice it is rotating if you look closely,\" says Miller. Most tornadoes are relatively small and short-lived, and can still be dangerous and cause damage. However, more violent tornadoes can be more than a mile wide and stay on the ground for more than an hour. This is because they have much more momentum than the smaller tornadoes, making them harder to stop. Miller has witnessed roughly 15-20 tornadoes during his years storm chasing. \"There is no denying that there is a certain amount of excitement that comes from seeing a tornado when you are set out with the intent of seeing one,\" says Miller. \"At the same time, you are balancing that excitement with a sizable amount of anxiety and concern over what the tornado could do, especially if there are residents in the immediate path of the storm. As someone who spent years studying, and many more years reporting on, tornadoes, it still gets all my nerves firing when you see a tornado in person.\" The smaller tornadoes have winds of 60-110 mph, while the more violent tornadoes can have winds from 160 to more than 200 miles per hour. The strongest winds ever recorded on Earth were from a tornado, on at more than  CNN's Jackson Dill and CNN meteorologist Haley Brink contributed to this report"},

Cayette, who uses a wheelchair, called parish officials for help. They never came. Parish officials, however, told CNN that they did not receive calls that match Cayette's situation, adding that the government is \"by law, not allowed to enter or conduct work on private property unless it is an emergency life saving measure.\" It wasn't until two days later when a group of volunteers from New Orleans came to saw and remove the trees that he was able to go outside. \"I've seen it all,\" Cayette, a retired industry worker, told CNN. \"After Hurricane Betsy in 1965, the chemical plants started building and operating. A lot of them. It all changed.\" About 50 miles away in St. John the Baptist Parish, Robert Taylor Jr., executive director of Concerned Citizens of St. John, said many residents were trapped in their attics after the storm while others witnessed their roofs being ripped off by Ida. The lack of after the hurricane, Taylor said, is just another example of the neglect the community has long suffered. Residents say the government failed to prepare the community for the storm by not issuing an evacuation order earlier or assisting poor and vulnerable residents who could not manage to flee their homes, like Cayette. \"The government is obviously failing us and not protecting us,\" said Taylor, who evacuated from St. John before Hurricane Ida hit. \"And this just pushed it over the top.\" The predominantly Black community of St. John and the nearly majority Black population of St. James sit at the heart of Louisiana's \"Cancer Alley,\" the 85-mile stretch between New Orleans and Baton Rouge that's home to more than 150 chemical plants and oil refineries. According to the Environmental Protection Agency's 2019 , \u2014 census areas that typically contain 600 to 3,000 people \u2014 with the country's estimated highest cancer risks are in St. John. Until recently, Cayette, who has lived in the region for 70 years and previously worked at a nearby petrochemical plant, never connected the growth of the chemical industry to the region's suddenly high cancer rates. But then his wife died of breast cancer a few years ago -- and he has been diagnosed with prostate cancer on top of his diabetes. Now, he lives alone with the sight of industrial facilities looming outside his window. \"I was mad and disappointed at the government,\" Cayette said about the lack of response after Ida. \"What concerned me even more is that I'm disabled, but they couldn't come to help.\" For decades, scientists have claimed the planet has been rapidly warming because of greenhouse gas emissions, particularly from the burning of fossil fuels. Days after Ida ravaged the homes of and Mississippi, the EPA concluding that racial and ethnic minority communities disproportionately suffer the most severe consequences of climate change, indicating they are the least able to prepare for, and recover from, extreme climate events such as pollution, flooding and heat waves. If the planet reaches the critical warming threshold of 2 degrees Celsius -- which most unless they drastically cut emitting greenhouse gases from fossil fuels -- the report warns that Black people are projected to face the worst impacts of the climate crisis. \"It's absolutely an insult that the companies that are responsible for this are also the ones that are driving climate change,\" Naomi Yoder, staff scientist at the Healthy Gulf, a group working to restore natural resources in the region, told CNN. \"They're also one of the biggest drivers of land loss in Louisiana, which makes the effects of hurricanes worse.\" The coronavirus pandemic has also hit both parishes especially hard. In April 2020, St. John had the highest death rate per capita for Covid-19 in the United States, surpassing even the most densely populated urban hotspots. Around that time in St. James, the Covid-19 death rate was also than the overall national death rate. More than a year later, with the pandemic persisting, Category 4 Hurricane Ida threw the area's high cancer and Covid-19 rates and underlying environmental health hazards, which come from the area's rampant pollution from fossil fuel industries, into harsh relief. \"It's just risk on top of risk on top of risk,\" Kimberly Terrell, director of community engagement at the Tulane University Environmental Law Clinic, told CNN. \"There's always air pollution coming out of industrial facilities, and these communities have been burdened with that for decades.\" The Rev. Lionel Murphy, pastor of Tchoupitoulas Chapel in St. John, said the storm left devastating damage to his church along with homes and other buildings in the parish, exacerbating the emotional and physical toll that air pollution and health disparities have placed on communities. \"If only we can get some attention,\" Murphy said, referring to public officials and emergency responders. \"The people are going to leave and come back, but this storm aggravates so much else because Covid is pretty strong in St. John.\" In the early months of the pandemic, Harvard's school of public health released a showing a link between fine particulate matter, also known as PM 2.5 pollution, and increased mortality rates from Covid-19. Terrell wanted to know what that meant for Louisiana, particularly in Cancer Alley. After scraping the raw data from the Harvard study and performing her own analysis, she found that the highest death rates from Covid-19 and a majority of PM 2.5 concentrations were in Cancer Alley. Ida added another layer of affliction by destroying houses and forcing residents to emergency shelters or relatives' homes, where they may be clustered together with potential for increased Covid-19 transmission. \"It seems like these communities are just continually burdened with risks that they didn't ask for, and don't deserve to be burdened with,\" Terrell said. The current 7-day average is more than 42 new Covid-19 cases per 100,000 in St. John and more than 177 new cases per 100,000 in St. James, according to . The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention categorizes St. John and St. James as a community with high levels of Covid-19 transmission. Taylor said he worries that residents who have been sickened by cancer as well as Covid-19 won't get the medical care they need after having to evacuate because of Ida's impacts. Some are being transported to shelters where they could potentially spread Covid-19 or even contract it, he said, echoing Terrell's concern. Prior to Ida, of residents in St. James Parish and St. John Parish were living below the poverty line, according to Census data. \"This is a mess,\" Taylor told CNN. \"I don't see how poor people are expected to survive this.\" The proliferation of petrochemical facilities and oil refineries throughout Cancer Alley has become a familiar sight to residents along the industrial corridor. Cayette said he remembers industrial facilities emerging after Category 4 Hurricane Betsy pummeled the region in 1965. But it was only recently that residents began to realize the invisible danger the industry caused on public health and the ironic effects it has on the climate. When a hurricane is barreling toward an industry-heavy region, petrochemical facilities and oil refineries typically begin to shutter their plants, which involves burning anywhere from hundreds to of hazardous materials. As part of emergency shutdown procedures, these facilities emit or burn various unprocessed chemicals and gases through a process known as flaring. Oftentimes, Yoder said, the emissions continue to escape even after the hurricane has knocked out power lines. \"This is not something new to these communities, and it's not necessarily even unique to a disaster situation,\" Terrell said of refineries emitting toxic compounds. \"It seems like consistently the people who are breathing these toxins are the last to find out about it.\" In St. Charles Parish, for instance, a Shell Norco manufacturing complex has been spewing residual gases as residents pick through the rubble of Hurricane Ida's aftermath. After the storm, the EPA contacted Shell about the excessive smoke and reports of noxious gas coming out of its refinery. In a report, that Shell is conducting \"community air monitoring\" and \"looking at all options to try to reduce emissions to flare.\" \"While the site is safe and secure, we are experiencing elevated flaring due to a lack of steam generation,\" Curtis Smith, a Shell spokesperson, told CNN. \"Crews are working around the clock to complete repairs and we are making good progress on minimizing flaring until power is restored.\" In St. James Parish, residents like Sharon Lavigne have been fighting new petrochemical plants attempting to set up shop in their community. Five years ago, Lavigne was diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis. Blood tests revealed that she had aluminum inside her body, which she later blamed on the slew of industrial facilities after attending a few environmental justice workshops. Angered by what she learned about the industry growing in her backyard, Lavigne founded RISE St. James, a faith-based environmental justice group trying to stop any new industrial development in Cancer Alley, which Cayette is also a member of. One of their was against the Taiwanese plastics manufacturer Formosa, which was set to build a in St. James Parish. Not only do Formosa's own that their mammoth facility could emit more of the cancer-causing compound than just about any other facility in the country, but their chosen location also happens to sit on two former 19th-century sugarcane plantations and a , according to a filed against the facility. \"My grandparents lived on this land. They bought this land and lived on it,\" Lavigne told CNN. \"And then when I got married, I built a house on this land.\" And while Formosa tried to push ahead with its construction during the pandemic, RISE St. James fought hard to block the company, delaying the construction further. The US Army Corps of Engineers early this year ordered Formosa to conduct a new environmental review of the petrochemical facility, thanks to legal complaints, protests and lawsuits like RISE St. James. While the battle to block the multibillion-dollar facility isn't over, Hurricane Ida added to the community's problems. The storm tore Lavigne's roof and caused her ceiling to collapse, just like it did to many other houses in the parish. \"So many of us suffered damages from Ida,\" Lavigne said, \"so after RISE members rebuild, we're going to help the rest of the community.\" Cancer Alley has faced many disasters, but none as challenging as a hurricane, air pollution and pandemic happening at once. To Cayette and Lavigne, living next to industrial facilities is a death sentence. It may take years for the community to recover, but Lavigne said they've been victorious before. As long as the fossil fuel industry continues to warm the planet and pollute their backyards, she said grassroots organizations will keep fighting. \"People tell me they're glad we're fighting the industry,\" she said. \"Many tell me they can't be out there to help me, but they're praying for me. That was nice.\""},

I've visited the Wall of Wind on the Florida International University (FIU) campus many times. It is a wall of enormous fans inside a big warehouse-type building that can blow air up to 160 mph, which would be a Category 5 hurricane, to test infrastructure and research the power of wind. However, in our changing climate, sadly, 160 mph isn't strong enough. So, the National Science Foundation (NSF) just awarded a $12.8 million Extreme Events Institute for the design of a full-scale testing facility capable of producing winds of 200 mph, along with a water basin to simulate storm surge and wave action in extreme winds. FIU will be able to build a house under the current building codes, start up the fans and see if it can withstand 200 mph winds. Will the roof detach? Will the house still be standing at all? The water basin will look like an enormous pool. It will also be able to simulate different coastlines. Storm surge tends to be worse when the coastlines are more shallow like along the Florida Panhandle. The facility will be able to simulate all of it. \"If you think about trying to future-proof, a changing hazard environment, a hazard scape, the US hazard scape with climate change, the past is not much of a guide. In fact, it can be deceiving,\" said Dr. Richard Olson, director of the Extreme Events Institute at FIU. \"So, if we're going to future-proof, we need to be able to research and test what future hazard events will look like. You can't future-proof in a changing environment if you're looking backwards.\" It's true. Climate change is showing us r, moving slower and are holding more water than ever before. They are also rapidly intensifying, meaning the winds are increasing at least 35 mph in a 24-hour period. In 2021, five hurricanes in the Atlantic rapidly intensified. And in 2020, TEN Atlantic hurricanes rapidly intensified. of those storms. \"Dorian in 2019 is the one that totally got my attention,\" said Olson. \"It hit 185 mph over the Bahamas, and until the last day and a half, it was heading straight up Eighth Street in Miami.\" Dorian ended up causing across Abaco and Grand Bahama. \"The scientific consensus is that we're going to see more intense storms, so we have to research and test for more intense storms,\" said Olson. \"Otherwise, nature's going to keep hitting us with harder stuff than we're ready for.\" The facility will be the first of its kind in the world to combine wind speeds of greater magnitude along with a water component. Eventually the facility will be able to test how different types of infrastructure, roads, bridges will all respond with a Category 6 storm. \"We can start putting all of these components together to get a much better picture of what nature is going to be hitting us with,\" says Olson. Yes, I realized I just referred to it as a Category 6 storm. And it might make some of you a little uncomfortable. To be honest, it bothers me a little bit too. But to be fair, if you look at the for the hurricanes, they are all -- more or less -- in about 20 mph increments. When a Category 5 hurricane's wind speeds start at 157 mph, and we see storms with maximum sustained winds of 180 mph, it's a number that makes me go pale. Since 2010, there have been 18 storms globally with recorded wind speeds of at least 178 mph at some point during their life span. and were two storms in the Atlantic to meet the threshold. It begs the question, especially for messaging purposes, do these types of storms need a special name? Category 6? Super-hurricane? Just something to put an exclamation point on how intense these specific storms are. But the truth of the matter is, most people who die in hurricanes don't die from wind, but from water. I reached out to my friend, Dennis Feltgen, the public affairs officer at the National Hurricane Center (NHC) about whether he thought there would ever be a day in our future we would see a Category 6, and here is what he had to say: I do agree with Dennis, but I also think as storms become stronger, wetter and slower, there might be a day the category system evolves from what it is now, just as the EF scale or Fujita scale was in 2007. And by the way, the same facility will also test tornado and thunderstorm winds. There are a few research facilities studying extreme winds. Watch below to see what 100 mph winds can do to a house. \"I think the interaction between the various components of hurricanes, the waves, the flooding, the currents, and the wind, the debris, all of that, it's very important to simulate that as practically as possible,\" said Dr. Arindam Gan Chowdhury, professor of environmental engineering at FIU. \"Everything is not possible to replicate Mother Nature.

But have you ever noticed hurricane hunters' flight patterns shown by meteorologists on TV look like random, odd shapes? Those flight patterns may look like boxes or stars, but they serve specific purposes for each individual storm. Hurricane hunters don't fly away from these storms like commercial airlines do. They fly directly into them, but they don't just fly into and around the storms randomly. There is a method to the madness. There are two distinctive groups of hurricane hunters, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the US Air Force Reserve (USAF). Both organizations fly missions into tropical disturbances in order to record invaluable data used by forecasters at the National Hurricane Center (NHC). For the Hurricane Hunters, there are two main types of missions flown, fixed and invest. Fixed missions are designated for systems that meet tropical cyclone qualifications, such as tropical depressions, tropical storms, and hurricanes. The main objective is to mark the center of circulation, monitor winds speeds and pressure changes, and other variables that are tricky for satellites in space to measure in full detail. For fixed missions, 'Alpha' is most common flight pattern used to collect data in a tropical cyclone. \"The Alpha pattern is the standard profile we fly for fix missions so it's the one people are most familiar with seeing from us,\" , meteorologist and aerial reconnaissance weather officer with the Air Force Reserve's , said. \"The pattern consists of two legs flown at intercardinal directions, and when complete, looks a lot like the Greek Alpha symbol when including the crossleg.\" Cardinal directions are the standard points on a compass: north, south, east, and west. Intercardinal directions are the diagonal points in between: northeast, southeast, southwest, and northwest. Interestingly, the bigger, stronger storms tend to be the \"easier\" ones to fly in. \"From my perspective as the onboard meteorologist, the Alpha pattern is the \"easiest\" to fly. Because we normally fly those on stronger storms, there's not a lot of question where the storm center is,\" DeHart said. \"The flights can be rough of course, but at the end of the day we just go fly through the storm center, collect the data, and send it to NHC.\" The primary objective of an invest mission is to determine if a system meets the definition of a tropical cyclone; storms that do not yet have a name or any real tropical structure characteristics. For invest missions, the NHC will often send estimated coordinates of where they believe the center of circulation is, which is where the missions will target for their starting point. However, invest missions by nature have to be a bit more flexible for flight patterns, simply because there are so many unknowns with these types of storms. \"We never know what we're going to find, yet we always have to be thinking two or three steps ahead. So that really makes us need to think about the meteorology [in each particular storm],\" DeHart said. \"Is it a closed low or an open wave? Maybe it's closed but just elongated? Is it battling shear? Are there several smaller swirls competing to be the main circulation center? Weak storms and invests can be very tricky and require a lot of thinking on our toes.\" Air Force Hurricane Hunters have a to choose from for invest missions: X, Delta, and Box, just to name a few. DeHart explains the missions are ideal for the weaker, more uncertain storms. While the X pattern may resemble the Alpha pattern, it is flown at much lower altitudes, usually around 500 to 1,000 feet. \"Once a system becomes a tropical storm or hurricane, the hurricane hunters begin flying at higher altitudes, ranging from 5,000 to 10,000 feet depending on the severity of the storm,\" said Jessica Kendziorek, public affairs operations chief with the USAF 403rd Wing. Flight levels for the Delta and Box patterns are usually at or below 5,000 ft absolute altitude. \"The Delta and Box patterns are similar in that we'll fly around the periphery of the forecast center seeing if we can observe winds in all four quadrants of the storm that would indicate a closed circulation. If we find a closed circulation, we can confidently go [find] the center; if not, we'll continue the mission in 'invest mode',\" DeHart said. NOAA Hurricane Hunters also fly operational fixed and invest missions (though the names may be different), but they usually have more research-oriented objectives. They fly many unique , with different types of aircraft, depending on what type of mission is assigned. Hurricane Hunters also fly a third type of mission, which the Air Force rarely flies, according to DeHart, called synoptic missions. For fixed missions NOAA often flies a Figure 4, Rotated Figure 4 pattern, or a Butterfly pattern. \"The Butterfly and Figure 4 patterns flown by the WP-3D through the storm are typically the ones used to [find] the center of circulation,\" said Jonathan Shannon, public affairs specialist for the NOAA Aircraft Operations Center Office of Marine and Aviation Operations. The Rotated Figure 4 pattern is as it sounds; the Figure 4 pattern turned on side. \"The goal with every flight is to gather data all around the center of the storm, and those patterns allow us to efficiently fly through a storm's various quadrants,\" Nick Underwood, NOAA Hurricane Hunter, said. \"This data helps with predicting a storm's intensity, as well as determining exactly where the center is.\" For invest missions, the Lawnmower and Square Spiral patterns are flown, to determine if there are actual tropical characteristics associated with the area in which they are investigating. \"The Lawnmower Pattern allows us to map out a large area when we don't have a center to aim for,\" Paul Flaherty, science branch chief at NOAA's Aircraft Operations Center, said. \"Once we are able to map a full circulation (usually by finding a west wind), we'll shift back to Figure 4's based on that newly identified center position.\" The Square Spiral pattern is a survey mission meant to supply observations on the structure and characteristics including information about the vortex center, if it exists. There is a unique third type of mission flight pattern, often used to sample the surrounding atmosphere which helps forecasters know the direction the storm is likely to go. The Star 1 pattern focuses on a scan of the outer edges of the system. The closely-related Star 2 pattern also does an outer scan of the system, while also adding in a circumference loop near the center of circulation. Recently, NOAA's Gulfstream IV flew a Star-2 pattern around Hurricane Larry, to investigate outflow patterns from the storm and better determine where the storm was headed. \"The flight pattern you'll typically see from our Gulfstream IV is a circumnavigation of the storm itself, as well as sampling of the atmosphere around and ahead of the storm,\" Underwood said. \"This data helps with predicting the storm's track.\" Regardless of which entity is flying, the operational missions are the backbone for the National Hurricane Center, tasked with providing essential life-saving information about a storm. The NHC takes the data and uses it to issue guidance and advisories to the public, so people know whether Elsa or Ida or Nicholas are still tropical storms or have become hurricanes. We ended 2020 with a 30 named storms in the Atlantic basin and if this season is anything like last year, we have a long way to go."},

It's called cloud seeding, and it's nothing new. It's been around since the 1940s and countries all over the world have been doing it for various reasons , but it's a growing practice in the US, especially in the drought-stricken West. It's also surrounded with controversy. We spoke with Julie Gondzar who is the program manager for , who admits she gets lots of calls about what they are doing. Gondzar said some people say \"you're playing God,\" others say \"you are stealing moisture from the storm,\" making other areas drier than they normally would be, kind of like robbing Peter to pay Paul. There are also environmental factors to consider, as well as the cost-effectiveness versus the reward, which in the West these days water is liquid gold. \"Think about it like water storage, but in the winter on mountaintops,\" is how Gondzar described what cloud seeding is trying to achieve in her state, \"in a nutshell.\" Wyoming started cloud seeding in 2003 . Then eight seasons ago, they started doing it in an official capacity after their 10-year study proved it works. This season, they have gone on 28 flight missions for cloud seeding in Wyoming. She pointed out there are four weeks left in the season, so she is hoping for more opportunities before it winds down. When you compare Wyoming to other states such as Utah and North Dakota, who have been cloud seeding since the '70s and '80s, the state is fairly new to the game. Cloud seeding uses an already existing cloud, and injects silver iodide into the cloud, which adds tiny particles called ice nuclei (which water needs to freeze). Clouds, in basic terms, are a collection of water droplets and/or ice crystals floating in the sky. The nuclei help the cloud produce precipitation, and artificial ice nuclei help create more precipitation than the cloud would produce otherwise. It's done in two ways: One way is from the ground and the other is from the air, using silver iodide as the seeding agent. \"The ground-based generators kind of look like small weather stations, are like 20 feet tall, and they aerosolize into the atmosphere,\" Gondzar explained. \"But you have to wait for the right atmospheric conditions so that the plume goes over the mountain range.\" It makes seeding a little more tricky, because if the wind is blowing in the wrong direction, you'll completely miss your target. The most popular way is by plane, using flares. \"There are flares on the wing of the planes with silver iodide inside of cardboard casings and there are flares on the belly of the plane,\" Gondzar pointed out. Once the pilot flies into the storm, they ignite the cardboard casings full of silver iodide and \"seed\" the clouds. The result is more moisture in the cloud, resulting in more precipitation. The silver iodide \"is a natural salt compound,\" Gondzar emphasized. \"The reason it's used is because the geometric shape down to a molecular level is very similar to that of an ice crystal. And if you don't have that, you're not going to create additional ice crystals, which will then accumulate into snowflakes.\" But if you think you can bust the drought by using planes to modify the weather, Gondzar said think again. \"Cloud seeding does not fix the drought,\" Gondzar said. \"You can't break a drought with cloud seeding. It's a tool in the toolbox.\" Gondzar admitted while they know the method makes more snow than they would otherwise receive, it's difficult to know exactly how much more they are getting. \"There's evidence of it in radar and all kinds of papers written,\" Gondzar noted. \"The question that they're trying to answer now is how well does it work? And that's a difficult question to answer. Because there's an abstract piece of this. There's really no way to know how much snow a particular system would have produced.\" She knows cloud seeding doesn't generate a lot of additional snowfall, but every little bit helps these days. According to , some areas in the state are only at 60% of average for snowpack this season, and the window for additional snow is slowly closing as the season winds down. Since most of the West gets the majority of its water from snowmelt, she hopes what they are doing helps a tiny bit in the long term. \"It's a small incremental change over a long period of time. That's why consistency is important,\" Gondzar urged. She added at $28-$34 per acre foot, cloud seeding is relatively cheap. \"Those numbers tell us that this is an inexpensive way to help add water to the system. Essentially, we are creating a little bit of additional snowpack, that becomes additional streamflow in the spring and summer.\" But you need a cloud, to cloud seed. You can't just go out to the Mojave Desert and make it rain. \"This is not something that we can do out of thin air,\" Gondzar cautioned. \"The criteria is very specific for this to actually work.\" It can only be done within already existing clouds that were going to produce snow anyway and there has to be a certain temperature range. \"The silver iodide in the cloud is initiating that snow,\" Gondzar said. \"But you can't just make snow out of nothing. You have to have the supercooled liquid water in the cloud.\" She explained part of what made this year difficult was the much drier weather during the last month. There were fewer opportunities to cloud seed. \"A lot of people think it's manipulating the weather pattern,\" Gondzar remarked. \"We are essentially just playing with cloud dynamics and cloud physics, on a super, super-small scale.\" She is a meteorologist as well and points out the moisture from the weather systems come from much bigger areas like the Gulf of Mexico or the Pacific. \"There's always a huge stream of moisture that our systems are tapping into, and cloud seeding probably brings an additional one to 2% down to the surface.\" While Gondzar is confident cloud seeding doesn't steal snow from another area, some scientists disagree. Daniel Swain is a climate scientist at UCLA and spoke with my colleague and climate writer . He told her \"It is possible that you're actually stealing water from someone else when you do this, because it may be, at least on a regional basis, a zero-sum game where if water falls out of the cloud in one spot, it's even drier by the time it makes it downwind to the next watershed.\" He went on to ask, \"To what extent are you just shifting around the spatial distribution of precipitation during a scarcity period rather than actually causing it to rain or snow more overall?\" He believes water equity issues need to be researched more. Another note of controversy has been the safety of the chemicals used in cloud seeding. Gondzar stressed it is not made of harmful chemicals like some people claim. She pointed out they did lots of testing for before they started officially cloud seeding and could not find any traces of harmful amounts of silver. \"There's silver in natural background levels in the water in the soil everywhere, on the surface of the earth,\" Gondzar noted. \"So you already have a natural background level of silver, it's been really difficult to find anything beyond background levels.\" She said the amount of silver iodide used is only a few grams at a time. What she's hoping is a small price to pay for bigger rewards down the road. There have been climate concerns surrounding cloud seeding. Here's more from Ramirez, who reached out to a few scientists, to get their take on cloud seeding's climate angle. Although cloud seeding has been around for decades and is currently being operated in roughly 50 countries, many climate scientists remain skeptical of the technology's efficacy as well as the time and effort put into trying to manipulate weather. Swain pointed out it has been historically difficult to design scientific experiments to test the effectiveness of cloud seeding, leaving behind a trail of unclear, intangible evidence on what the benefits are. \"How do you know how much precipitation that might actually end up falling from that cloud occurred due to the seeding? Or how much would have fallen without the seeding?\" Swain told CNN. \"This isn't a setting where you can do a truly controlled experiment.\" Cloud seeding experiments typically deal with a narrow set of parameters, according to Swain, taking into account weather conditions including cloud cover, time of the day, and location. Additionally, the rapidly changing climate adds another layer to the list of variables. As the planet warms, weather patterns and clouds will constantly evolve, often in unexpected ways. That's what Sarah Tessendorf, a scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, and other researchers from universities and an Idaho power company, set out to examine in 2017. , published in 2020 in the Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences, managed to quantify how effective cloud seeding is. Yet uncertainties still linger. During the cold winter months in 2017, the researchers flew aircraft to inject silver iodine, the seeding chemical used, into clouds over the Payette Basin in Idaho, while simultaneously using radars and models to measure its impact on snowfall. In three cloud-seeding events, the scientists identified \"unambiguous seeding patterns,\" in cold cloud decks not producing ice at all; but once seeded, ice crystals formed inside mirroring the same pattern the aircraft had flown. They were then able to track the formed ice and snow to the ground and measure how much additional snow fell from the seeded clouds. Despite the results, Tessendorf said more experiments need to be done to improve the technology for it to become a sweeping solution to the climate crisis. The amount of precipitation produced by cloud seeding \u2014 up to 10% \u2014 isn't enough at all to quench the drought-stricken West. \"It could help over the years augment the storage levels in reservoirs, so that when you get into that extract, you might just go into that drought with a little bit more than you would have otherwise,\" she said. \"That to me is the way that cloud seeding should be viewed. It's not going to be the silver bullet, but it could be a helpful tool in a water manager's toolbox.\" When it comes to tackling climate change as a whole, many also question the methods such as the deployment of fossil fuel-powered aircraft to inject silver iodide into clouds, arguing it is counterintuitive to the overall climate goals of slashing fossil fuel emissions. But Tessendorf argued it is a small price to pay in order to improve the technology. \"I will say that the number of aircraft and the duration of these flights to do cloud seeding and the programs that are currently having it done pales in comparison to the number of commercial flights and aircraft we have in the skies all over the world right now,\" she contended. \"So it's to me a drop in the bucket of extra fossil fuels being burned.\" \"But that does not mean that there isn't room for improvement there in order to have more of a clean process,\" Tessendorf added. With the climate crisis accelerating, climate scientists like Swain say resources are much better invested in climate solutions already guaranteed to make significant and equitable impacts. \"There needs to be controlled studies that actually shows it was the seeding that increased the precipitation in a meaningful way,\" Swain asserted. \"The best case scenario is it's a small incremental adjunct to other water-saving or conservation measures during scarce periods, but even that's not clear if it would really work in that capacity in any systematic way.\" CNN meteorologist Judson Jones contributed to this article"},

We had several this year that brought , staggering to the mountains in the west, and even . An atmospheric river is a long, narrow region in the atmosphere that can transport moisture thousands of miles, like a fire hose in the sky. We talk a lot about them in the West because large-scale storm systems bring the region up to 40% of their yearly rainfall. But we started wondering: Is there anywhere else where these happen? Apparently, atmospheric rivers also occur in the eastern US, unleashing a river of moisture like what we will see this week. The reason East Coast atmospheric rivers aren't talked about much isn't because they are rare. In fact, they are quite common. \"Atmospheric rivers are more frequent on the East Coast than they are on the West Coast,\" said Jason Cordeira, Associate Professor of Meteorology at Plymouth State University. \"They're just not as impactful and don't usually produce as much rainfall.\" While Cordeira noted it is tough to give an exact number of how many atmospheric rivers impact the East every year, he says a rough estimate would be anywhere from 80-100 per year! WOW. The West gets about half that number of atmospheric rivers each year, yet they account for double the annual rainfall percentage. \"The West Coast is a much more arid climate. And they usually get precipitation during just half of the year,\" Cordeira pointed out. The East Coast accumulates its annual rainfall from several sources: afternoon storms, cold fronts and hurricanes, which can bring MUCH higher rain amounts than an atmospheric river. \"Some of the strongest atmospheric river events that are perfectly oriented, can produce 6-8 inches of rain,\" Cordeira reported. \"Those totals are dwarfed by the amount of rainfall that we can get from a hurricane.\" Some recent hurricanes such as , have resulted in rainfall totals measured in FEET, not inches. This week's atmospheric river won't leave the footprint Harvey did by any stretch, but it could affect the same areas as Harvey. The Deep South will once again be hit by a series of storms this week, along with the Plains, the Rockies and the Pacific Northwest. So, needless to say, this week's weather will be much more far-reaching. It has no doubt been a super active stretch of severe weather in the South and Southeast, as this is the fourth week in a row where active weather is affecting the same areas. However, as we get deeper into April and May, we should start to see the storm tracks shift a little farther north into what is traditionally, \"Tornado Alley,\" which is what we will begin to see this week. A series of storm systems will impact the US this week from coast to coast. It will bring everything from blizzard conditions to tornadoes to flash flooding, an exhausting week to say the least. The Storm Prediction Center (SPC) has placed a Level 3 out of 5 \"enhanced risk\" of severe weather today for central Arkansas, however, anywhere from San Antonio to the Ohio Valley could see storms today. The extreme northeast of Texas, southeast Oklahoma and western and central Arkansas, including Little Rock, are under a tornado watch until 11 p.m. CT Monday. Large hail -- possibly greater than baseball size -- and wind gusts to 70 mph are also a concern for the area. While this is happening in the central part of the country, a robust system will be entering the Pacific Northwest, and will crisscross the country in dramatic fashion today, bringing heavy rain to the coastal areas of Washington, Oregon and California, and several feet of snow for the Cascades. \"This system will deepen as it moves farther inland, setting the stage for an intense late season winter storm to impact the Rockies and Northern Plains,\" noted the Weather Prediction Center (WPC). \"Over a foot of snow is likely to accumulate between eastern Montana and central North Dakota on Tuesday.\" Blizzard warnings are in effect for portions of the Dakotas and Montana from Tuesday through Thursday. \"Total snow accumulations between 12 and 24 inches [are forecast],\" said the National Weather Service (NWS) office in Bismarck. \"Winds gusting as high as 50 mph [are also possible].\" The heavy snow and high winds will make travel nearly impossible for those areas due to whiteout conditions and will also create avalanche dangers. Many of the western mountain ranges have some sort of avalanche danger today, so be sure to check before heading out, especially in the backcountry. We wrote a story earlier in the season about what causes extreme avalanche dangers and why you only have about 15-30 minutes to be found alive after burial. Click to read more. After the system blankets the West with its late-season dump of snow, the storm will amplify as it heads east. It will combine with the available moisture provided by the atmospheric river we talked about and will result in the perfect setup for severe weather. The tornado threat will be even stronger for Tuesday and Wednesday in the midsection of the country. But the storms will be impacting areas much farther north than the previous rounds of severe weather we have seen during the last three weeks. Tuesday there is again a Level 3 out of 5 \"enhanced\" risk of severe storms from Dallas to Omaha, which includes more than 16 million people. While it is the area with the highest likelihood of storms, nearly 40 million people will have some possibility of seeing storms. \"Any thunderstorms that can develop in this very favorable thermodynamic environment will likely become severe quickly,\" the SPC advised. They mentioned any (strong thunderstorm) will be capable of producing tornadoes, saying \"some of the tornadoes could be strong.\" By Wednesday, we enter Day Three of this multiday severe event. The main threat area will shift east with the third day of a Level 3 out of 5 \"enhanced risk\" of severe weather. The bullseye will be from northern Louisiana to the south side of Chicago and include places like Shreveport, Little Rock, Memphis, St. Louis, and Indianapolis. \"Large to very large hail, damaging winds and tornadoes will all be possible,\" said the SPC. \"Strong tornadoes may occur.\" Dallas, Houston, New Orleans, and Chicago could all see storms as well. The good news is the severe threat will be over in time for Easter weekend. We could still see some lingering showers in the eastern half of the country, and some mountain snow in the Rockies, which could affect egg hunts and sunrise services. While things could change between now and then, right now the SPC doesn't have any areas highlighted for severe weather during Easter weekend as of now. As if severe storms and blizzard conditions weren't enough of a headline this week, extremely cold air will follow the front, plunging overnight temperatures into the single digits is forecast for portions of the northern Plains. \"Low temperatures in the single digits are possible and this could cause issues,\" said the NWS office in Billings. \"Do not be deceived by the sun, it is going to be fighting a very cold airmass.\" And as the climate crisis continues to change the dynamics of our weather, expect atmospheric rivers to become more intense as well. \"It's expected that as the air temperatures increase, the air can hold more water vapor and therefore any storms that are comprised of water vapor will have more of it,\" Cordeira explained. \"So, an atmospheric river, which is defined as a region of water vapor, will likely become more intense. Their frequency may not be more common, but their intensity could become larger.\" The drought-stricken West is getting even drier, according to the latest . \"Central Washington, Idaho, and northwest Montana also saw increases in drought extent or severity as short-term dryness continues to build upon long-term moisture deficits extending back to last year,\" according to the drought monitor. \"Many parts of southern Idaho, and the rest of the West, have set records for the driest three-month period (January to March) going back 100 years or more.\" Texas is also facing extreme drought with 95% of the state in some level of drought. At 26,000 square miles, Texas has more \"exceptional drought\" area than any other state, per the latest US Drought Monitor. The 26,000 square miles of exceptional drought is larger than the state of West Virginia (or more than three times the size of Massachusetts). The drought is only making fire conditions worse. From Texas to Kansas, there will be an extreme fire danger especially on Tuesday, as dry conditions and winds topping 50 mph will cover the area.

According to provisional data published Wednesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, life expectancy at birth dropped by nearly a year between 2020 and 2021 -- and by more than two and a half years overall since the . Life expectancy at birth fell to 76.1 years, the lowest it has been in the US since 1996, and the biggest 2-year decline in a century. Covid-19 was the driving factor, with deaths from the virus contributing to half of the decline from 2020 to 2021, according to the report from the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics. The death rate from Covid-19 was higher in 2021 than it was in 2020, so it wasn't particularly surprising that life expectancy would fall again, Bob Anderson, chief mortality statistician for the CDC, told CNN. Also, drug overdose deaths reached a record high in 2021, killing about 109,000 people. And deaths from unintentional injuries -- about half of which are due to drug overdose -- was the second-leading cause of the decline in life expectancy. Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, also said it wasn't surprising, but it is frustrating. \"It is distressing to see a continuing negative impact of drug overdose on the life expectancy of Americans. These deaths often occur in young adults and therefore represent a tragically high number of years of life lost and devastating impact on individuals, families, and communities,\" she said. \"We have the science and the tools available to help us reverse this trend and reduce the number of overdose deaths in this country. But these tools are not being used effectively.\" Even if expected, the scale of the decline is still extraordinary. In 2021, mortality rates due to influenza and pneumonia decreased, and if not for these \"offsetting effects,\" the decline in US life expectancy would have been even greater, according to the report. \"Mortality generally, mainly since the 1950s, has changed rather slowly,\" Anderson said. Changes of more than a few tenths of a year have been considered substantial. The recent decline among American Indian and Alaska Native people is particularly \"astounding,\" Anderson said. The life expectancy for this group plunged by nearly 2 years between 2020 and 2021 and a startling 6.6 years since 2019 -- more than twice as much as it did for the total US population. At 65.2 years, the life expectancy for American Indians in 2021 was equal to the overall US life expectancy in 1944. \"When I saw that, in the report, I just -- my jaw dropped,\" Anderson said. \"It was hard enough to fathom a 2.7 year decline over 2 years overall. But then to see a 6.6 year decline for the American Indian population -- it just shows the substantial impact that the pandemic has had on that population.\" Deaths from Covid-19 directly were the leading contributor to the decline in life expectancy among American Indian people in 2021, but deaths due to drug overdose and other unintentional injuries, as well as chronic liver disease, which is often caused by alcohol abuse, were nearly equal contributors for this group. When it comes to the pandemic, Anderson said, \"I'm not just talking about Covid-19 necessarily, but also the other factors that seem to have increased during the pandemic.\" Experts say the pandemic exacerbated already existing disparities for American Indians and others. Dr. Matthew Clark, a chief medical officer with the Indian Health Service, said the findings of the new CDC report are concerning, but it has been known that American Indian and Alaska Native people \"suffer disproportionately with regard to health outcomes for a broad variety of conditions.\" There are \"unique aspects to addressing health outcomes\" in these communities, he said, and this data should be viewed as a \"call to action, an opportunity to redouble our efforts\" to address a broad range of factors that impact the health of these populations and engage with tribal communities to find solutions. \"Even in the midst of a very concerning report like this, I do think that there's hope,\" Clark said, and \"there is an opportunity to move the needle in the other direction.\" To do that, the goal should be to explore the root causes of those disparities for American Indians and others, said Ruben Cantu, an associate program director with Prevention Institute, a nonprofit focused on health equity. \"A lot of the talk is going to be around the pandemic,\" Cantu said. \"But we need to think about what has driven the conditions that have allowed certain communities to be more vulnerable\" in the first place, like crowded housing, poor access to health care and low-income jobs that don't allow for paid sick leave. A , published as a preprint in June, found that the decrease in life expectancy in the US over the course of the pandemic was \"highly racialized\" and substantially larger than it was for a set of comparable countries. In fact, that study found that life expectancy increased slightly between 2020 and 2021 for the set of 21 peer countries. The new data from the CDC highlights differences in life-expectancy trends by race and ethnicity, as well as by gender. In the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic, life expectancy declined least among White people. In the second year of the pandemic, however, this group saw the second-biggest decline in life expectancy -- and deaths due to Covid-19 contributed to the drop among White people more than any other racial or ethnic group. Once the most vaccinated group, the share of the White population that is fully vaccinated with their initial series now lags behind that of the Black, Hispanic and Asian populations, CDC data shows. Life expectancy in 2021 was highest among both Asian women (85.6 years) and men (81.2 years), the CDC data shows. Hispanic women were the only other group with a life expectancy greater than 80 years. In the total US population, life expectancy fell more among men than among women in 2021, widening a gap that has been growing over the past decade. The disparity in life expectancy between men (73.2 years) and women (79.1 years) is now nearly six years. The life expectancy for American Indian men in 2021 was 61.5 years, lower than any other group. Black men had the next lowest, at 66.7 years. A recent project by the Prevention Institute focused on the mental health and well-being of men and boys. It found that men and boys of color -- especially Black and Native American men -- \"start out with higher rates of trauma and mental health challenges,\" Cantu said, which can make them more vulnerable to other conditions. \"Over the last five or six years, we've heard a lot more about diseases of despair -- things like substance use, alcoholism and suicide -- and a lot of those things are connected,\" he said. \"It helps to point out how vulnerable certain communities can be to a lot of other conditions.\""},
{"url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/30/health/monkeypox-case-trends-slow/index.html", "title": "Monkeypox infections are slowing in the US. It's not clear if that will last", "paragraphs": " The pace of new monkeypox cases reported in some major cities -- and in the US overall -- has started to slow recently, but experts say it's too early to know if the trend will last. On Friday, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said that she is \"cautiously optimistic\" about the downward trend, but warned that the overall case count is still growing. \"The rate of rise is lower, but we are still seeing increases and we are of course a very diverse country and things are not even across the country. So, we're watching this with cautious optimism,\" she said. Last week, there were an average of 337 new cases of monkeypox reported each day in the US, according to . That's a 24% drop from two weeks earlier -- a difference of more than 100 cases a day. A few factors are \"working together to bend the curve,\" Walensky said, including vaccination, behavior changes and harm reduction messages \"being heard and implemented.\" But many more factors are still in flux, leaving questions unanswered. Local health departments say they are working hard to understand the factors driving case trends. Washington, DC, has been an epicenter of the outbreak since the beginning; the city has had nearly 12 times more cases per capita than the country overall. The local health department has seen a \"slight decrease\" in cases over the past week, but said that \"education and vaccines\" are two key factors that will drive trends going forward. And \"with 100,000 students that will return to DC within the next week, it is too early to project the trends,\" they said. The California health department said that state trends over the last several weeks suggest \"stabilizing rather than increasing transmission levels\" and daily cases \"leveling off.\" \"The trend could continue but will depend on vaccination and behavior change as noted previously,\" they said. New York City Health Commissioner Dr. Ashwin Vasan said last week that the city has also seen \"cases begin to fall and transmission slow\" in recent days. Even if cases rise again, Donal Bisanzio, a senior epidemiologist with the nonprofit research group RTI International, predicts that there will be a \"rapid reduction\" at some point. Monkeypox \"is a disease that gives you full protection after you get it,\" he said. Reinfections aren't a factor. But no one knows for sure what's next. \"I think every public health response that I have ever worked, we want a crystal ball. It's just exceedingly hard to get there really early on, even for things that we have understood much better for years,\" said Janet Hamilton, executive director of the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists. \"Tell me when influenza season is going to end. I can't. \" Experts say that the ongoing outbreak is a rapidly evolving situation, making it difficult to know what to expect in the coming weeks and months. \"There is a very strong interest in using models and thinking about what the trajectories would be in different scenarios,\" Hamilton told CNN. All data-driven models require that at least some reasonable assumptions are incorporated. But with monkeypox, the United States is still collecting some of the foundational \"shoe leather epidemiology, boots on the ground pieces,\" Hamilton said. It's a \"highly infectious disease that's spreading very rapidly that we don't fully understand.\" Some of the stigma attached to the current outbreak may make people reluctant to seek medical attention, discuss recent contacts or come forward to get vaccinated, experts say. \"I'm always concerned about stigma and discrimination, as it can hinder trying to control an outbreak like this,\" said Dr. Wafaa El-Sadr, a professor of epidemiology at Columbia University who has researched HIV, emerging infections and other diseases. It could mean people aren't \"taking advantage of the important tools we have at hand to stop this outbreak.\" Generally, only about 15 to 25% of contacts are being identified, which can skew the understanding of the rate of disease spread, Hamilton said. \"That ends up being a very distinct challenge that then would directly impact what those models look like.\" While men who have sex with men have been disproportionately affected in the current outbreak, anyone can get monkeypox and a growing number of cases reported recently have been among women and children -- potentially changing the transmission map even more. And a recent shift in the federal vaccination strategy -- that potentially expands the existing vaccine supply by as much as five times, but poses other challenges -- marks a major change to another key forecasting factor. More than 1 million vials of the Jynneos vaccine have been allocated to states and other local jurisdictions, according to data from the US Department of Health and Human Services. However, only about 208,000 doses have been reported to the CDC as administered. In June, researchers from RTI International published that estimated the potential burden and duration of the monkeypox outbreak that did not yet have endemic disease. They projected that every three cases could cause 18 secondary cases if no prevention measures were put in place, with outbreaks lasting about six to nine months. Contact tracing and vaccination of close contacts could cut that risk by more than 70%, according to the model. But new knowledge and information has led them to adjust the model and rerun it, with updated estimates due out in a few weeks. \"We are talking about a model that was done just in the first month of transmission outside Africa. We were thinking that everything was going well,\" said Bisanzio, who is a co-author of RTI report. The model assumed that the public health response would be quick and effective, especially coming on the heels of the Covid-19 pandemic. \"We know that this story then evolved in a different way,\" he said, with a lag in response time, hesitancy around vaccination and transmission concentrated within one high-risk community that no one expected. \"I can tell you that the numbers (in the updated model) are much higher than the ones that we first estimated.\" That said, another one of the biggest adjustments to their model comes from a of men who have sex with men, in which about half of respondents said they changed their behaviors to protect themselves amid the ongoing outbreak. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington built an influential Covid-19 forecast model early on in the pandemic, but will not be doing the same for monkeypox. \"In our mind, this disease is not going to spread into the community as wide as we've seen with Covid,\" said Ali Mokdad, an epidemiologist and professor of health metrics sciences at IHME. There are some similarities to HIV that are concerning, but \"we don't see that being replicated here,\" he said, with monkeypox moving out of the body much faster and being much less deadly. While extensive data-driven models may be largely absent, experts say they are keeping a close watch on trends. \"You don't need a model to tell you that, at this point in time, the strategy has to be to identify those high risk individuals and vaccinate as many as possible,\" Hamilton said.

All the homes are just destroyed,\" Tezeno recounted. She took a long pause; the wound was as fresh as it was that August day in 2020. Tezeno arrived at her Cameron Parish neighborhood fearing the worst, and amid the rubble, there stood her home. It looked unscathed. But Tezeno's feelings of hope were quickly dashed when she opened the door. Inside, it was a very different story. \"The back was all blown out. The AC unit flew off the back of our house. All the siding came off the house, my back porch on my house with two bedrooms and the bathrooms were all caved in,\" Tezeno told CNN. For two years, Tezeno -- a single mother -- and her four children have not been able to move back in as the home gets repaired. She's been living with relatives as she balances what seems like three full-time jobs: her actual full-time job, raising her family, and endlessly dealing with insurance companies. \"This whole thing has taken an emotional toll on me,\" she admitted. Tezeno and her family are preparing to move back in a matter of weeks, which also happens to be right in time for the start of the hurricane season. NOAA is predicting , with 6-10 hurricanes and 3-6 major storms (Category 3 or higher). According to Colorado State University, the chances of Louisiana getting hit with a named storm within 50 miles this season are 84%. \"Oh Jesus, keep us spared,\" Tezeno sighed. As Tezeno and her fellow Louisianans try to mentally prepare for hurricanes yet to come, two years after Laura, Lake Charles -- 45 miles north of Cameron Parish -- still looks like a blue patchwork quilt. \"I still see blue tarps out there, there are plenty of homes and businesses that are still not completely put back together,\" Lake Charles National Weather Service meteorologist Stephen Corbani observed. \"There is a literal PTSD out there in the community,\" explained Lake Charles Mayor Nic Hunter. \"It's a visceral thing.\" The storm cost more than a billion dollars in the state of Louisiana alone, with more than 44,000 households approved by to receive housing assistance. According to , there are still more than 2,000 cases still open in the Lake Charles area -- that's 2,000 families still working to rebuild. \"We have some homes that literally have not been touched since Hurricane Laura,\" Hunter noted. But he told CNN they just got word . \"Though it has taken far too long, there is over a billion dollars in federal aid that has been allocated for hurricanes Laura and Delta. We are immensely thankful for that,\" he added. The previous two hurricane seasons have been particularly cruel for Louisiana. In 2020, , and in 2021, , a Category 4 behemoth, battered the southeastern part of the state on the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. The poundings have left residents wary of what lies ahead. \"Certainly, as we approach hurricane season, locals are just a bit more on edge than they were prior to 2020,\" Hunter acknowledged. While it is impossible to know exactly where these storms will make landfall, the forecasts are grim. \"Looking at some of the climate signals that are out there, like , it seems like we're in store for another above normal season, just in terms of numbers and activity across the Atlantic basin,\" Carboni projected. Lake Charles is home for Carboni too, and like Tezeno, he hopes this year's busy season doesn't end up affecting his area, still so vulnerable from two seasons ago. \"The last thing we need would be for another hurricane to affect this area,\" Carboni remarked. If you are in a hurricane zone and are preparing for the upcoming season, hopefully you have a plan for you and your family, as well as a . After talking to Tezeno, though, she expressed some advice I think many times gets overlooked. \"Write down everything that you have. I don't care if it's minor and take pictures of everything that you can and check your policy,\" she urged. She also recommended securing your home if you evacuate. She recalled many of her neighbors fled their homes, only to come back and find it structurally damaged AND everything inside looted. Lastly, she advised having some sort of hurricane savings account. \"Have as much as you can to take care of yourself without relying on insurance, because sometimes they are not as quick to come to your aid as you think.\""},

The US Food and Drug Administration has authorized updated vaccines that target the original strain of the coronavirus as well as the Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5. The hope is that these shots will improve protection against the currently circulating viruses that cause . Who should get these new shots? When will they be available? And why should you consider one? Here's everything you need to know about the bivalent boosters. These new bivalent vaccines carry instructions to help our cells make defenses against two strains of the virus that causes Covid-19. The shots direct cells to make antibodies that bind to certain parts of the spike proteins from both the original strain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron subvariants, which share an identical spike. BA.4 and BA.5 are the dominant variants in the United States, causing an average of 91,000 new infections each day. \"These are vaccines that are made, manufactured and delivered identically to the Covid mRNA vaccines that most of us have already gotten,\" said Dr. Gregory Poland, who leads the vaccine research group at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. \"In a sense, you've just changed the blueprints.\" Having twice the blueprints doesn't mean you're getting twice the dose of active ingredients, though. \"The total mRNA content -- the business part of the vaccine -- that leads to the immune response is the same amount,\" said Dr. William Gruber, senior vice president of vaccine research and development at Pfizer, which makes one of the updated vaccines. Pfizer's booster is a 30-microgram dose that contains 15 micrograms of mRNA against the ancestral strain and 15 micrograms against the BA.4 and BA.5 variants. It is authorized for people as young as 12. The company is also retooling its shots for children ages to 5 through 11 and will ask the FDA for authorization of those updated boosters in early October. It's working with the FDA to update vaccines for children ages 6 months through 4 years. Moderna's bivalent booster is a 50-microgram dose, with 25 micrograms of mRNA designed to fight the ancestral strain of the coronavirus and 25 micrograms of mRNA designed to fight the BA.4 and BA.5 variants. It's authorized for people 18 and older. The government has already been taking orders for these vaccines, and now that the FDA has authorized them, millions of doses will ship to tens of thousands of sites across the country. These include community health centers, health departments and pharmacies. As with past Covid-19 vaccines, these shots will be available free of charge. But they may be some of the last Covid-19 freebies from the government, which has said it's going to start commercializing treatments and vaccines this fall. Pfizer says it has the capacity to ship up to 15 million doses by September 9. The panel of experts that advises the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on its vaccine recommendations reviewed the science behind the shots Thursday and voted to recommend them. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky then signed off, meaning people can start getting the shots right away. \"What I'm expecting is, after CDC action, you'll start seeing some places start giving some shots in arms over the weekend, but very relatively few because [of the] Labor Day weekend. And my expectation is over next week, or certainly over the next 10 days, you're going to start seeing these bivalent vaccines become widely available across the country,\" Dr. Ashish Jha, who leads the White House Covid-19 Response Team, told CNN. The Biden administration expects appointment availability to ramp up over the first several days, with broad availability in a few weeks. People will be able to find locations at . The government is also preparing to launch a campaign that will urge Americans to get their annual flu shot along with an updated Covid-19 booster. Research on this approach suggests that it's safe. The updated Covid-19 inoculations will be the only game in town when it comes to boosters, at least for those 12 and up. The FDA says the older boosters are no longer authorized for this age group but will still be available as boosters for children ages 5 to 11. These are the first Covid-19 vaccines that will be authorized for use in people after being tested only in mice. This is much the same process that's followed each year when annual flu shots are updated. The FDA allowed companies to submit data from animal tests in order to speed these shots to the public. Studies in people are underway, according to Pfizer's Gruber. Dr. Peter Marks, who directs the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said he expects that it will be a month or two before data on humans is available. Officials say urgency with these boosters is warranted going into the fall, when Covid-19 is still circulating at high levels and influenza is expected to make a return. But the decision to rely on animal studies has generated some controversy. Some vaccine experts feel that animal studies don't provide sufficient evidence for these vaccines at this stage in the pandemic. \"You're asking people to get a new product for which there's no data,\" Dr. Paul Offit, who directs the vaccine education center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told CNN. \"Mice data are not adequate to launch 100-plus-billion-dose effort.\" Offit says it makes sense to use data from animal studies for updates to annual flu vaccines because we've used those shots for decades, and we understand what biomarkers to look for when gauging whether they work. These so-called correlates of protection are not as well understood for the Covid-19 vaccines. It's not just the shots that are different, Poland said. At this point in the pandemic, our immune systems are, too. Nearly all Americans have been infected with the coronavirus, vaccinated or both. Some people have had four or five doses of vaccine. \"So if you say to me, 'can you assure me that getting dose five or dose six of this new vaccine in the background of having received these previous doses is absolutely safe?' I'd say 'no, I can't.' We're extrapolating. And I think we ought to be clear about that,\" Poland said. FDA officials point out that animal studies weren't the only data they reviewed to make their decision. They considered two other lines of evidence. The first is the vaccines' track records. The same basic vaccines have now been given to hundreds of millions of people around the world. They have been shown to be extremely effective at preventing severe disease and death from Covid-19. Risks associated with mRNA vaccination are very, very low. The second line of evidence comes from bivalent vaccines that may soon be used in Europe. Earlier this year, Pfizer and Moderna presented an independent panel of experts who advise the FDA with data on a bivalent vaccine designed to target the original strain of Omicron, BA.1. That data showed that the vaccines boosted antibody responses and were well-tolerated. The UK has authorized these vaccines, but they will not be available in the US. The BA.1 strain isn't circulating any more, and the FDA asked the manufacturers to update their US shots to include BA.4 and BA.5 instead. Marks said in a briefing Wednesday that some evidence suggests that the BA.4 and BA.5 strains generate a stronger immune response than BA.1, which is another reason officials wanted to include them in the updated shots. FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said he understands that people may want to know more, but he's confident that these vaccines are safe and effective. \"It's fair for people to raise questions. But this really is the best consensus that we have among the experts that this is the best way to go. ... It's just painful to see people dying unnecessarily when there's a free treatment that would prevent their death,\" he said. \"I will be at the front of the line at the pharmacy getting my vaccination,\" said Califf, who will turn 71 next month. \"I'm very confident about this.\" In the past, tests of variant-specific vaccines have had lackluster results. It's hard to know what effect these bivalent vaccines could have. In a recent , published ahead of peer review, scientists tried to estimate this with a meta-analysis, or a study of studies. The gathered estimates of antibody levels after booster doses against the ancestral strains, as well as against specific variants, and tried to use those levels to predict how well the shots would work. They found that people got the biggest benefits from getting boosted, period. A booster against the ancestral strain of the virus that causes Covid-19 increased neutralizing antibodies 11-fold. The scientists estimated that would increase a person's protection against symptomatic infection over the next six months from 50% to 86.5%. Variant-specific boosters worked a little better, but the difference wasn't dramatic. After those shots, protection against symptomatic infection over the next six months rose to 90.2%, just a 4.6% increase. A of adverse events after mRNA booster vaccinations in adults the United States found that side effects were less common after booster doses than after second doses of the vaccine, and most were mild. About 1 in 8 adults reported a headache, fever or pain after a booster. In children and teens, after boosters were pain at the site of the injection, fatigue, headache and muscle aches. Very rarely, mRNA vaccines can cause myocarditis, or swelling in or around the heart. After more than 80 million booster doses given in the United States, the government safety surveillance systems received 37 verifiable reports of myocarditis. Most of these were in men. The highest rates of myocarditis in adults were in younger men -- ages 18 to 24. For every million booster doses given to men this age, the CDC expects about that about will have myocarditis. For adolescents, the rate is slightly higher but still extremely low: about for every million doses. Marks said that to minimize this risk, officials are directing that the vaccines be given at least two months after a previous dose. \"It seems to be associated when they're given closer to one another,\" he said. The Covid-19 vaccines were due for an update. As the coronavirus has been circulating, it has changed a lot. These changes have helped it slip past the antibodies that we made against older versions of the virus and older versions of the vaccine. As a result, it's gotten better at causing reinfections and breakthrough infections. Some of the monoclonal antibodies made to give people passive immunity against the virus have also stopped working against the new variants. The hope is that giving people updated vaccines will improve their ability to fight off the infection and shore up protection against severe disease that causes hospitalization or death. There is also some hope that updated boosters may slow the spread of the virus -- and thus the speed at which vaccine-busting variants appear. The coronavirus is changing at blistering speed. In a meeting with FDA vaccine advisers last June, Trevor Bedford, a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Reserach Center in Seattle, compared the speed of evolution of the viruses that cause Covid-19 to that of the viruses that cause influenza. Among the faster influenza viruses, he said, it takes about three years for a new strain to emerge and start showing up in testing in significant numbers. Among the variants of the virus that causes Covid-19, the Delta variant pulled off this feat in a year. Omicron did it in three to four months. So there is genuine concern that without something to slow transmission of the infection, we'll be forever stuck in catchup mode, waiting for faster and potentially more dangerous variants to emerge.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Prediction Center on Tuesday forecast 14 to 21 named storms, six to 10 hurricanes and three to six major hurricanes -- of Category 3 strength or greater. The 2020 and 2021 seasons both exhausted the hurricane name list and broke records. No one can say for sure if this year will be similar, but in early April, , which were right in line with what NOAA is forecasting. The CSU forecast called for 19 named storms, nine hurricanes and four major storms. After back-to-back years of using all the hurricane names and resorting to the Greek alphabet, the World Meteorological Organization decided to do away with using the Greek alphabet and to be used if all the hurricane names are exhausted once again. Of course it's impossible to know how many of those storms will make landfall along the US coast, or where the largest storms will develop. However, during the announcement, NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad recognized that the current hurricane cycle for the Atlantic is a busy one. \"If you go back two years, the 2020 hurricane season broke records across the board and it's the most active season on record with 30 named storms,\" said Spinrad. \"The 2021 hurricane season, which is the third most active year on record in terms of names of storms brought us 21 named storms with impacts, ranging from the Appalachian Mountains all the way to New England, resulting in over $78.5 billion in US damage.\" There are several contributing factors that play into a \"busy\" hurricane season. \"We are in an active period,\" said Spinrad. \"There are certain ingredients that drive the intensity and the frequency of hurricanes.\" One is the existing in the equatorial Pacific. This phenomenon creates cooler-than-average ocean temperatures around the equator in the Pacific and results in weather impacts around the globe. La Ni\u00f1a presents favorable conditions for hurricanes -- in contrast to that of El Ni\u00f1o. Hurricane seasons under El Ni\u00f1o conditions are known for upper-level wind patterns across the Caribbean that tear hurricanes apart as they try to form, making the seasons less active. Another reason for the above-normal forecast is the location of what's called the \"Gulf Loop Current.\" This current is \"a 600-foot-deep river of hot Caribbean water that travels between Cancun, Mexico and western Cuba into the Gulf,\" said CNN meteorologist Chad Myers. This loop current is flowing farther north now, forcing warm water at deeper levels of the ocean to travel closer to the coastal areas along the Gulf of Mexico. \"The warm water is simply too deep and the hurricane has an unlimited supply of hot water for intensification,\" said Myers. Forecasters are comparing the position of the loop current with where it was placed in the record-breaking 2005 season -- when Hurricanes Katrina and Rita both made landfall. \"Yes, the loop current does look like 2005,\" said Matthew Rosencrans, lead hurricane season outlook forecaster with NOAA's Climate Prediction Center. \"But it depends if a storm actually moves over that loop current and forecasting the specific track of storms is not something we can do beyond a week time frame,\" Rosencrans added. During the 2021 hurricane season, eight storms made landfall along the US Gulf Coast and in 2020 six made landfall along the Gulf. In 2020, and both slammed into southwest Louisiana, making landfall roughly 15 miles apart. \"In 2021, ripped through Southeast Louisiana, then caused more . \"Hurricane Ida spanned nine states, demonstrating that anyone can be in the direct path of a hurricane and in danger from the remnants of a storm system,\" said FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell. \"It's important for everyone to understand their risk.\""},
{"url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2021/07/14/world/tusimple-autonomous-truck-spc-intl/index.html", "title": "There's a shortage of truckers, but TuSimple thinks it has a solution: no driver needed", "paragraphs": " Right now, there's a shortage of truck drivers in the and , exacerbated by the e-commerce boom brought on by the pandemic. One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks, and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one. Among them is San Diego-based TuSimple. Founded in 2015, TuSimple has completed about 2 million miles of road tests with its 70 prototype trucks across the US, China and Europe. Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology, TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world's largest truck manufacturers -- Navistar in the US and Traton, Volkswagen's trucking business, in Europe -- to design and build fully autonomous models, which it hopes to launch by 2024. TuSimple's latest road test involved hauling fresh produce 951 miles, from Nogales, Arizona to Oklahoma City. The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver, but for the bulk of the route -- from Tucson to Dallas -- the truck drove itself. \"Today, because the system is not fully ready, we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we're testing, but we drove in full autonomy: the driver wasn't touching the wheel,\" said Cheng Lu, TuSimple's president and CEO. The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver, mostly because a truck doesn't need to sleep. \"In the US, a driver can only work 11 hours a day. We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation,\" said Lu. That, of course, negates the advantage of an autonomous system, so the idea is that once TuSimple's trucks hit the market, there will be no need to have anyone onboard. Unlike self-driving cars, which are a still , TuSimple trucks won't be required to operate in bustling city traffic, but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company's own software.  \"We collect data from the roads, and we create this very detailed, high definition map of each route. That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles,\" said Lu. As a result, TuSimple's trucks will only be able to self-drive along these pre-mapped trade corridors, which Lu calls \"virtual railroads,\" and nowhere else. According to the company, in the US 80% of goods travel through just 10% of the nation's trade corridors, so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business. TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas, and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024. Its plans are dependent on state legislation, however, because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads.  The technology will add about $50,000 to the cost of a truck, making the final price roughly $200,000. According to Lu, that's still cheaper than paying for a human driver. \"If you take $50,000 and divide it by 1 million miles, the average lifespan of a truck, that means you're adding five cents per mile. But you're saving the cost of a human driver, which based on average US wages is about $80,000 to $120,000 per year -- or 80 cents to $1.20 per mile. Today, the direct labor cost is about 50% of the cost of operating a truck,\" he said. That doesn't mean driverless trucks will take away jobs, according to Lu. By focusing on the \"middle mile,\" rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods, TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers, while at the same time protecting existing jobs. \"A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day -- that's not what autonomy is meant for. We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver, even if they enter the workforce today,\" said Lu. Instead, TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers, which involve long stretches of monotonous driving. \"Take Phoenix to El Paso: that's a six-hour drive. A person cannot make the round trip, because it's more than 11 hours. But the truck can go back and forth all day, the most mundane job that drivers don't want to do. That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile (pickup and delivery).They get to work a full day, which is a more efficient use of their time, and they get to go home at night to their family,\" said Lu. Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased, TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests, without a human safety driver in the cabin at all, before the end of the year. The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024. Lu says that 7,000 have been reserved in the US alone.  TuSimple has prominent competitors, such as Google spinoff Waymo and Uber-backed Aurora, but those are working on a wider range of self-driving vehicles, including passenger cars. TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks, like US companies Plus and Embark.  Grayson Brulte, an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte & Co., believes TuSimple is on the right track. \"The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose-built for trucking. They're not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class-8 trucks. These are different skills and different systems altogether,\" he said.  Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits. The company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers, and can see farther down the road, even at night. \"In the US every year there are about 5,000 fatalities involving trucks, and most are due to human error,\" said Lu. \"The truck doesn't get tired, doesn't watch a movie or look at a phone. It doesn't get distracted.\""}
