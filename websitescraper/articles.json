Thursday's announcement follows the largest climate funding package in U.S. history, which President Joe Biden signed into law in August. The package includes incentives to jump-start domestic supply chains for electric vehicle batteries, although Piedmont said plans for the plant were in development prior to the Inflation Reduction Act. Now that the company has selected the site in McMinn County, it will begin the process of securing the necessary permits, which can be lengthy. Still, the company is targeting construction beginning in 2023, with production starting in 2025. When fully operational, the plant will produce 30,000 metric tons of lithium per year, making it the largest lithium refining facility in the U.S, according to the company. Piedmont said it will churn out enough material to supply roughly 500,000 electric vehicles annually. Piedmont currently has no active mines in the U.S., so once the facility is up and running it will process spodumene concentrate from Piedmont's international operations in Quebec and Ghana. Eventually, the company hopes to use lithium that's mined domestically. The company has plans for a mine as well as another plant in North Carolina, although CEO Keith Phillips said it's challenging from a permitting perspective, since both the mine and the plant are on the same site. Albemarle runs the only meaningful lithium mine in the U.S., which is in Silver Peak, Nevada. Additionally, only 2.1% of lithium is refined in the U.S., according to data from Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. China dominates the industry, refining more than half of global lithium supply. Should Piedmont's North Carolina mine and plant secure the required permits, however, the company forecasts its lithium output doubling, with the company supplying 1 million electric vehicles per year. Piedmont Lithium's announcement also comes as automakers are rushing toward vast electric vehicle fleets. By some forecasts, there simply won't be enough lithium to meet demand in the foreseeable future. The International Energy Agency estimates that in order to meet the goals set forth in the Paris Agreement, lithium demand will grow by over 40 times by 2040. Building new mines takes years. They're capital intensive and can face permitting challenges. There are also those opposed to new mines, who argue that the world should instead focus on existing production. Piedmont's Phillips noted that in just the last year $33 billion has been announced for electric vehicle battery manufacturing plants in the U.S., which would require 500,000 metric tons of lithium annually. \"That is more than all the lithium hydroxide produced in the world currently, so clearly the industry is facing a critical resource shortage,\" he told CNBC. \"Anyone who can produce material to supply this market \u2014 especially domestically in the United States \u2014 will be in a favored position.\" Piedmont plans to invest around $600 million developing the Tennessee facility."},

It is the first time the FDA has authorized an updated vaccine formula since the original shots rolled out in December 2020. Pharmacies are expected to start administering the new boosters after Labor Day weekend. The U.S. has secured 171 million doses of Pfizer's and Moderna's updated shots so far, according to the Health and Human Services Department. Pfizer's new booster dose is authorized for people ages 12 and older, while Moderna's new shots are authorized for adults ages 18 and older. The eligible age groups can receive the boosters two months after completing their primary series or their most recent booster with the old shots. The U.S. will no longer use the original vaccines as booster doses for individuals ages 12 and older now that the the updated shots have been authorized, according to the FDA. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has to sign off on the boosters before pharmacies can give them to patients. The CDC's independent advisory committee is scheduled to meet Thursday and Friday to review the data and issue its recommendations for health-care providers. Public health officials believe the redesigned boosters will provide longer-lasting protection against the virus and reduce hospitalizations this fall and winter. The new boosters target both the original strain that emerged in China more than two years ago, which scientists refer to as the \"wild type,\" and omicron BA.4 and BA.5, which are now the dominant variants in the U.S. Shots that target two different strains are called bivalent vaccines. The vaccine makers developed the original shots against the strain of Covid that first emerged in Wuhan, China, in 2019. But the virus has mutated dramatically since then. Omicron and its subvariants have drifted so much from the original Covid strain that the virus is able to slip past the protective antibodies induced by the vaccines. As a consequence, the shots' effectiveness at preventing infection and mild illness has declined substantially as the virus has evolved. Though the vaccines are still generally preventing severe disease, the protection they provide against hospitalization has slipped over time as well. \"There is declining effectiveness against hospitalization and severe illness. The problem has been persuading the American people to get boosted on a regular basis,\" said Dr. Peter Hotez, an infectious disease expert at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas. Hotez led a team that developed a Covid vaccine based on protein technology that is authorized in India. About 76% of people ages 12 and older have received their first two vaccine doses in the U.S., according to CDC data. About 50% of those individuals have received their first booster dose. For adults ages 18 and older, three doses of Pfizer's or Moderna's original vaccines were 55% effective at preventing hospitalization from the omicron BA.2 subvariant four months after the third shot, according to CDC data. Three shots were 19% effective at preventing infection from omicron five months after the third shot, according to CDC data from August 2021 through May 2022. The rapidly spreading BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants have since driven omicron BA.2 out of circulation. Dr. Peter Marks, head of the FDA office responsible for reviewing vaccines, said the hope is that the updated boosters will restore the high level of protection against disease that vaccines demonstrated when they were first authorized in December 2020. \"We don't know for a fact yet whether we will get to that same level, but that is the goal here. And that is what we believe the evidence that we've seen helps point to,\" Marks told reporters during a news conference after the authorization Wednesday. The Biden administration moved rapidly over the summer to get updated shots ready for the fall. Public health officials are worried the U.S. is on the verge of another wave of infection as more transmissible omicron variants spread, immunity from the original vaccines wears off, and people head indoors to escape colder weather. Pfizer and Moderna were originally developing boosters to target omicron BA.1, the variant that caused the massive wave of infection last winter. But the FDA told the vaccine makers in late June to switch gears and target BA.4 and BA.5 instead as those variants quickly gained ground. The sudden change in plans left little time for clinical trials in humans before a fall rollout. As a consequence, the authorization is based on human clinical trials from the BA.1 shots, which produced a better immune response than the original doses, according to the FDA. But it's unclear how the BA.5 boosters will perform in humans since the data is based on BA.1. Marks said it will likely be at least another two months before human clinical data on the BA.5 shots is made available to the public. The most common side effects from the human trials of the BA.1 shots was pain, redness, swelling at the injection site, fatigue, headaches, muscle pain, joint pain, chills, nausea, vomiting and fever, according to the FDA. The Covid vaccines also have a well-established safety profile after administration to millions of people over the course of the pandemic, the FDA said. In addition to human data from the BA.1 shots, the authorization was also based on animal studies from the BA.5 boosters, Marks said. In June, Pfizer also presented data to the FDA's independent vaccine advisory committee that showed the bivalent omicron BA.5 shots increased antibodies in mice that protect against infection by about 2.6-fold compared with the original vaccine. Marks said the FDA used the same process for the authorization that it relied on in the past for switching the strains in flu vaccines. \"We're pretty confident that or what we have is very similar to the situation that we've done in the past with influenza changes where we don't do clinical studies for them in the United States,\" Marks said. \"We know from the way the vaccine works, and from the data that we have, that we can predict how well the vaccine will be working.\" But some infectious disease and vaccine experts say the FDA should have waited for human data from the BA.5 shots before authorizing them. Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the FDA's advisory committee, said data based on mice studies is not sufficient to justify authorizing the new boosters. \"You have to show some evidence in people that the immune response that you're getting with the bivalent vaccine is clearly better, and those data haven't been presented,\" said Offit, an infectious disease and vaccine expert at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. \"You can't ask millions of people to get this booster dose without showing some human data that you have a dramatic increase in neutralizing antibodies to the BA.4/BA.5 strains as compared to boosting with the ancestral type,\" Offit said, referring to the currently authorized shots based on the version of Covid that emerged in China, more than two years ago. Michael Osterholm, a leading epidemiologist and director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, also said more data needs to be presented on how the BA.5 shots perform in humans. \"It's not that I don't think it could work,\" Osterholm said. \"But I think we need the data first to show that the immune response to this vaccine is equivalent to or better than what we have already.\" But CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky, in a radio interview, said waiting longer for human data from the BA.5 shots could mean the boosters become outdated if a new variant emerges. Walensky said the change in the vaccine formula is small and should not affect safety. \"There's always a question here of being too slow versus too fast,\" Walensky told \"Conversations on Health Care\" in a radio interview. \"One of the challenges is if we wait for those data to emerge in human data [...] we will be using what I would consider to be a potentially outdated vaccine.\""},
{"url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/01/us-health-officials-brace-for-another-fall-covid-surge-but-with-fewer-deaths.html", "title": "U.S. health officials brace for another fall Covid surge, but with fewer deaths", "tag": "Health and Science", "author": "Spencer Kimball", "datetime": "2022-09-01 16:08:01", "paragraphs": " Fall is on the horizon and public health officials are again bracing for another wave of Covid cases. Over the past two years, fall and winter have brought devastating Covid surges that took hundreds of thousands of lives and pushed hospitals to the breaking point. But U.S. health officials say the nation is in a much different place today due to the arsenal of tools doctors now have to fight the virus. \"We are in a much, much better place. We are in a better place because people have gotten vaccinated and boosted. We've got treatments that are widely available,\" Dr. Ashish Jha, White House Covid response coordinator, said in an August interview with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in a report published in early August, said high levels of immunity in the U.S. population from vaccination and infection have substantially reduced the threat of hospitalization and death from Covid. The CDC ended its quarantine recommendations for people exposed to the virus last month. Public health officials are calling on people to stay up to date on their vaccines, but are largely leaving it up to individuals to decide what other precautions they should take based on their health history, risk tolerance, and how much Covid is spreading in their communities. The CDC is taking a more targeted approach that focuses on making sure those at the highest risk of severe illness have access to vaccines, antiviral treatments and other therapeutics to protect their health. Many people haven't had a vaccine dose in months, which means their immune protection against the virus is waning off with some studies showing three shots of the original vaccines were just 19% effective at preventing Covid infection after 5 months. At the same time, more transmissible omicron subvariants are spreading. It's creating a perfect storm ahead of the cold weather months and holidays that force people indoors in close proximity to each other and a highly contagious airborne pathogen. Even with all the tools the U.S. has available, Covid infections, hospitalizations and deaths have plateaued at stubbornly high levels over the summer. The U.S. is gearing up for a booster campaign after Labor Day with reformulated vaccines that target both the original strain of the virus that emerged in Wuhan, China in 2019 and omicron BA.5, the dominant variant in circulation. Public health officials believe the reformulated boosters will provide more durable protection against infection and help avert a major surge that taxes hospitals. \"It's going to be really, really important for people to get this updated, new, very specific Covid vaccine because I think it's going to help a lot in preventing infections, and I think it is going to help a lot in keeping people out of the hospital,\" Jha said. The U.S. has secured 171 million doses of Pfizer's and Moderna's new boosters shots that target omicron so far. The reformulated boosters could reduce infections by 2.4 million, hospitalizations by 137,000 and deaths by 9,700 from August through May of 2023 if a new variant doesn't emerge, according to a projection by a a team of scientists who forecast the trajectory of the pandemic, called the Covid-19 Scenario Modelling Hub. But the projection is based on optimistic assumptions about booster coverage and efficacy, according to the scientists. The model assumes that the shots will prove 80% effective at preventing illness, the vaccination campaign will ramp up quickly, and the public will broadly embrace the new boosters. But many people in the U.S. still haven't gotten their first booster with the old vaccine yet, and it's not clear that these individuals will be more willing to take the new shots. About 76% of people ages 12 and older have received their first two vaccine doses, according to CDC data. Out of those people, about half have gotten their third shot. It's also not clear how effective the new omicron boosters will be in the real world yet. The Food and Drug Administration authorized the shots on Wednesday without results from human trials on the BA.5 shots. But Dr. Peter Marks, head of the FDA office responsible for reviewing vaccines, said the available data suggests the shots will provide substantially better protection. Public health officials are working under the assumption that the U.S. will face some version of omicron in the fall, which is why the new vaccines target BA.5. But there is always the risk that a new variant outside the omicron lineage will emerge that can evade the new shots. If Covid mutates in a way that gives life to a new, dominant variant and boosters are slow to get out to the public, the U.S. could suffer 1.3 million hospitalizations and 181,000 deaths over the next nine months, according to the scientists' most pessimistic scenario. But Michael Osterholm, director of Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said the reality is that nobody really knows what will happen in the fall. \"We don't know,\" he said. Ali Mokdad, an epidemiologist at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, said his group is predicting a rise in Covid cases, deaths and hospitalizations this fall. \"But the rise in mortality and hospitalization will not be similar to what we have seen before, simply because most people have some kind of immunity against illness,\" Mokdad said. About 95% of people ages 16 and older in the U.S., in fact, have Covid antibodies of some sort \u2014 either from vaccination or prior infection, according to the CDC survey of blood donor data. This means more people in the U.S. have at least some protection against severe disease and death from Covid than at any other point in the pandemic. Previous infection, vaccination alone and vaccination plus infection didn't necessarily keep people from getting sick, but they all showed more than 70% effectiveness against developing a really severe case or dying from omicron BA.2 , according to a study published in t he New England Journal of Medicine by Weill Cornell Medicine in Qatar. The study examined the medical records of 100,000 individuals in Qatar from December 2021 through February 2022. But the Qatar study may not translate well to the U.S. population, which has a large elderly population and many people with pre-existing medical conditions, like obesity or diabetes. Qatar on the other hand has a very young population \u2014 only 9% of its residents are age 50 or older compared with more than a third of all Americans. Omicron has also continued to evolve into more transmissible and immune-evasive subvariants. The BA.5 subvariant became dominant this summer, pushing out BA.2. Though BA.5 has not been associated with more severe disease, it is more effective at evading immunity and infecting people who are vaccinated or who have recovered from Covid. \"BA.5 is the most contagious, certainly the most immune evasive variant we've seen,\" Jha told NBC News in July. \"That means if you were infected earlier this you're still at very high risk or reinfection. It means if you've not been vaccinated recently you have a very high risk of having a breakthrough.\" While the CDC previously though that infection provided about 90 days of protection, Jha told reporters in July that breakthrough infections have become more common and are happening earlier with BA.5. He said it's unclear how long immunity lasts after recovering from a BA.5 infection. Osterholm said the pandemic has entered another unprecedented period. Previously, infections have surged to high peaks and then steeply declined before the next wave. But for the past three months, infections, hospitalizations and deaths have plateaued at a high level with no sign of another variant displacing BA.5, he said. \"We're seeing now more and more people are on their second and third episodes of this,\" Osterholm said. \"What is the interaction between increasing vaccination, natural infection and immunity related to infection? We just don't know,\" he said. It's unclear whether the current pattern of transmission will continue or if the U.S. will face another wave, Osterholm said. Right now, the U.S. is averaging more than 88,000 new infections daily, which is likely a vast undercount because people testing positive at home isn't picked up by the official data. More than 32,000 people total are hospitalized across the U.S. with Covid right now, and an average of nearly 400 people are still dying every day from the virus, according to data from the CDC and Health and Human Services Department. That's a significant improvement from the peak of the outbreak in the winter of 2021 when more than 3,000 people died a day on average. Though milder today than those early days of the pandemic, Covid is still killing at four or five times the fatality rate of the flu, Jha told the Chamber. \"If everybody was up to date on their vaccines and people got treated with Paxlovid as they're supposed to deaths would go to close to zero across America,\" Jha said. Hospitalizations are down 75% and deaths are down 85% from the peak of last winter's omicron surge. But if deaths remain at their current level through next year, more than 140,000 people would succumb to the virus, which would still make Covid one of the 10 leading causes of death in the U.S. \"Will we continue to see this kind of activity maintained for some time? People will say it can't go on endlessly because people will be infected develop immunity. But what happens with waning immunity?\" Osterholm said. Many elderly people and individuals with weak immune systems remain vulnerable to the virus. The rate of hospitalization and death from Covid has increased among those ages 65 and older since April despite high levels of vaccination in this age group, according to CDC data. Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Brown University School of Public Health, said she is worried about the elderly and those with weak immune systems who are not up to date on their vaccines heading into the fall. Nuzzo said the public health response this fall should be laser focused on making sure these people are protected. \"I have some worry that unless we put that at the top of our list, our efforts are just going to be diluted, spread out over a number of different areas,\" Nuzzo said. \"If we fail to make sure the highest risk people are fully protected, that's when we're going to see the deaths and that's the most important thing we could try to prevent.\" Although 92% of those ages 65 and older received the first two doses of the vaccine, many of them have not stayed up to date with their boosters. About 70% received their third dose and only 40% have gotten their fourth shot since the FDA authorized it in February. People ages 50 and older who received a second booster dose were 14 times less likely to die from Covid than the unvaccinated, and three times less likely to die than people who had one booster dose, according to CDC data. Dr. Paul Offit, an infectious disease expert at Children's Hospital Philadelphia, said people ages 75 and older, people with serious medical conditions and those with compromised immune systems would benefit the most from getting a booster right now. Deaths from Covid have risen in particular among people ages 75 and older, according to CDC. The CDC has also emphasized the importance of using therapeutics to protect people who simply cannot mount a strong immune response to the virus even with vaccination. Nearly 3% of U.S. adults have compromised immune systems, or about 7 million people ages 18 or older, according a survey published in 2016 in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The CDC has emphasized the importance of administering an investigational antibody therapy called Evusheld for people ages 12 and older with moderate and severely compromised immune systems. Evusheld is administered as two injections, before Covid infection, every six months to prevent severe illness, according to the FDA. But only 450,000 courses of the medicine have been administered so far, according to the health and Human Services Department. \"The goal moving forward here for this year, next year, five years and 10 years down the road is protecting the vulnerable,\" Offit said."},

Although monkeypox cases are still increasing nationally, the speed of the outbreak appears to be slowing, Walensky said. The U.S. has reported nearly 17,000 monkeypox cases since May, more than any other country in the world, according to CDC data. In New York City, which has reported more infections than any other jurisdiction, new monkeypox cases have dropped from more than 70 per day on average to nine as of Thursday, according to data from the city health department. Dr. Aswhin Vasan, the city health commissioner, said earlier this week the outbreak has slowed due to increased vaccination and community outreach efforts. New York City has reported a total of 2,888 monkeypox cases. In Chicago, another major epicenter of the outbreak, new cases have dropped from 141 during the week ended July 30 to 74 for the week ended Aug. 20, according to that city's health department. Chicago has reported a total of 807 cases. \"We're not seeing the potentially exponential growth that we were seeing early on so that is reassuring,\" said Dr. Allison Arwady, Chicago's public health commissioner, during a Facebook live event earlier this week. \"Too early to say things look really good, but definitely some signs of slowing of cases.\" The U.S. is nearing the point where the entire community of gay and bisexual men who currently face the greatest health risk from monkeypox rwill have access to two doses of the monkeypox vaccine, according to Dawn O'Connell, head of the office responsible for the national stockpile at the Health and Human Services Department. The CDC previously estimated that up to 1.7 million gay and bisexual men who are HIV-positive or are eligible for medicine to reduce their chance of contracting HIV face the greatest health risk from monkeypox. The U.S. has distributed 1.5 million doses of the monkeypox vaccine so far and more than 3 million doses should be available by when the latest distribution round is complete, according to O'Connell. To date, the outbreak is disproportionately affecting Black and Hispanic men. About 30% of monkeypox patients are white, 32% are Hispanic and 33% are Black, according to CDC data. Whites make up about 59% of the U.S. population while Hispanics and Blacks account for 19% and 13%, respectively. The monkeypox vaccine, called Jynneos in the U.S., is administered in two doses 28 days apart. The patients will not have full protection from the vaccine until two weeks after the second dose is administered, according to the CDC. Data from 19 jurisdictions show that nearly 97% of the shots administered so far were first doses, according to Walensky. About 94% of monkeypox cases are associated with sexual contact and nearly all of the people who have contracted the virus are men who have sex with men, according to Demetre Daskalakis, the deputy head of the White House monkeypox response team. A CDC survey of 824 gay and bisexual men found that 48% respondents have reduced their number of sexual partners and 50% have reduced one-time sexual encounters during the current outbreak. A separate CDC study found that a 40% decrease in one-time sexual encounters would reduce the final percentage of gay and bisexual men infected with monkeypox by up to 31%. \"We're actually seeing vaccine get out, behaviors change, harm-reduction messages being heard and implemented,\" Walensky said. \"And all of that working together to bend the curve.\" Correction: 33% of confirmed monkeypox cases are among Black Americans. A previous version of this story misstated the figure."},

But booking airfare on a certain day of the week isn't one of them, according to data from Google Flights. Booking mid-week \u2014 and especially Tuesdays around midnight \u2014 is often cited as the best time to purchase flights. But in the past five years, U.S. airfares purchased on Tuesdays, Wednesday or Thursdays have been only 1.9% cheaper on average than airfares purchased during the weekend, according to Google Flights. \"If your trip is just a couple of weeks away, don't wait for Tuesday to roll around \u2014 book your flight now in case the price goes up,\" wrote James Byers, Google Flights' group product manager, on a blog post published yesterday. While the day of the week travelers book may not matter much, the day they fly does, according to Google Flights' research, which examined five years of historical flight data from Aug. 1, 2017 to Aug. 1, 2022. \"On average, flights that depart on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday have been 12% cheaper than weekend departures,\" wrote Byers. \"If you exclude international destinations, the potential savings jump even higher to 20%.\" Another common strategy \u2014 booking early \u2014 also works, according to the data. For U.S. domestic flights, airfares have been lowest between three and eight weeks before a departure date, with prices \"bottoming out\" 44 days out, according to the research. Non-stop flights cost on average about 20% more than connecting flights, according to Google Flights, but flights with stops also increase the risk of interruptions. An Instagram poll by the travel insurance company World Nomads indicated more than 1 in 3 respondents spent up to $250 on flights, meals or hotels because of flight delays or cancellations this summer, while 12% reported spending between $500 to $1,000. Travelers with flexible flying days can use Google Flights' \"date grid\" function to quickly ascertain the cheapest dates to depart and arrive in a given week. Those who want to travel for a specific duration \u2014 say, two weeks \u2014 but are flexible on when, can use the \"price graph\" function to see the cheapest times to fly too. Price tracking also eliminates the need to search again and again to price-check a desired route. Search the route once, hit the button to \"track prices\" and Google Flights will send notifications of airfare changes via email. Based on its historical data, Google Flights also suggests the \"best times\" to book flights for peak-period travel and popular routes. Travelers hoping to save money on airfare to Europe are advised to plan the earliest, while summer vacationers can consider making plans weeks, rather than months, in advance."},

The country is also set to remove indoor mask requirements from Aug. 29, as it seeks to take another step toward living with Covid. While the further easing of safety and border measures is a \"significant milestone,\" the country must still \"be mentally prepared for any sudden change because we don't know how this virus will mutate and what the next variant will look like,\" said Singapore's deputy prime minister Lawrence Wong, who is also co-chair of the Covid task force in Singapore. Visitors who are not fully vaccinated will still be required to test negative for Covid within 2 days prior to their departure for Singapore. But they will no longer need to serve a 7-day quarantine at home or at their place of residence. Currently, fully vaccinated travelers can enter Singapore without taking Covid-19 tests or undergoing quarantine. Non-vaccinated long-term visitors and short-term visitors who are 13 years and above are currently required to apply for entry approval to enter Singapore. This requirement will also be lifted from Monday, according to the Ministry of Health. Masks will be optional indoors and required in special settings, such as on public transportation and in health-care settings like hospitals, residential care homes and ambulances from Monday, the health ministry said. They are optional in taxis, private hires and in the airport. \"The reason is that, we have identified areas where essential services are being carried out in enclosed, crowded spaces and which are frequently used by vulnerable persons,\" said Wong, who is also the country's finance minister. The decision to lift mask requirements was first announced by Prime Minster Lee Hsien Loong on Sunday. Currently, masks are required in nearly all indoor settings, with the exception of workplaces where there are no physical interaction or customer-facing areas. \"For business and employers, they have the discretion to decide whether or not they might want to do this [from] a workplace safety point of view \u2026 we are lifting a mandatory requirement for mask-wearing but it is optional,\" said Wong. In preparation for the next wave of omicron, the health ministry said a second mRNA Covid booster is now recommended for those who are 60 years and above. Previously, second boosters were only recommended for those who were 80 years and older. Around 93% of the population completed the primary vaccination series as of Monday, while 79% of the total population received boosters. The high booster rate is a \"key reason\" that the nation has been able to ride through the current Covid wave, said Singapore's health minister Ong Ye Kung. Ong stressed the need to expand recommendations of second boosters to those who are 60 to 79 years old \u2014 five months after their first booster \u2014 even though the first booster has provided strong protection against severe illnesses for those in this age group. The health ministry also recommended that children between 5 to 11 years old receive one booster \u2014 five months after the second dose of their primary vaccination series \u2014 to boost their protection. Plans are in place for a potential new Covid wave, perhaps in the winter, said Wong. \"We are continuing to monitor closely and we have drawer plans in place for various contingencies including scaling up our healthcare capacity as well as \u2026 vaccination operations if and when the need arises,\" Wong said at the press conference on Wednesday. He added that those plans would \"buy us time,\" should there be a Covid wave that is aggressive and dangerous. Average daily infections over a 7-day period fell to 2,700 as of Tuesday, as daily infections continued to fall from a record 26,032 infections on Feb. 22. Most of those infected in Singapore have mild or no symptoms. The Southeast Asian country further eased Covid measures at the end of April. Social gatherings will no longer be limited to 10 people and people will not need to keep 1 meter apart. In April, separate rules for unvaccinated people were also removed, with some exceptions. Those who are not vaccinated will still not be allowed to dine in, or participate in events with more than 500 people. Neither can they visit nightlife establishments where dancing is involved. However, food and beverage outlets won\u2019t be required to check the vaccination statuses of customers, the health ministry said in a press release."},

Explaining its decision, the company \u2014 one of several in England and Wales to have announced water usage limits in recent weeks \u2014 said extreme temperatures and this summer's heatwave had resulted in the highest demand for water in more than 25 years. \"The driest July since 1885, the hottest temperatures on record, and the River Thames reaching its lowest level since 2005 have led to a drop in reservoir levels in the Thames Valley and London,\" it said. The TUB does not apply to businesses, although Thames Water said it was asking those within its area \"to be mindful of the drought and to use water wisely.\" This could involve companies switching off water features on their premises and not washing their vehicles, it suggested. \"Implementing a Temporary Use Ban for our customers has been a very difficult decision to make and one which we have not taken lightly,\" Sarah Bentley, the Thames Water CEO, said. \"After months of below average rainfall and the recent extreme temperatures in July and August, water resources in our region are depleted,\" Bentley added. The announcement of the ban comes at a time when many water companies are facing criticism related to leaks from their pipes. For its part, Thames Water said it had teams focused on locating and fixing more than 1,100 leaks per week. When it comes to enforcement of the ban, the firm said it hoped and expected customers to continue using water wisely. \"If we become aware of customers ignoring the restrictions, we'll contact them to make sure they're aware of the rules and how to use water responsibly and wisely,\" it added. \"There are criminal offences for those that repeatedly ignore requests to comply with the ban.\" Last month saw temperatures in the U.K. surge, with highs of over 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) recorded for the first time ever. On Aug. 12, the U.K.'s Environment Agency announced that parts of England had moved into drought status. \"In drought affected areas the public and businesses should be very mindful of the pressures on water resources and should use water wisely,\" authorities said. They added that government expected water firms \"to act to reduce leakage and fix leaking pipes as quickly as possible and take wider action alongside government policy.\" The U.K. is not alone when it comes to drought-related issues. On July 18, the European Commission's Joint Research Centre published a report looking at drought in Europe. \"The severe drought affecting several regions of Europe since the beginning of the year continues expanding and worsening,\" it said. \"Dry conditions are related to a wide and persistent lack of precipitation combined with early heatwaves in May and June.\" In an interview with CNBC earlier this week, Bill Hare, CEO and senior scientist at research non-profit Climate Analytics, explained how the current conditions were having wide-ranging effects. \"On the water supply, it's clear that in the U.K. and other parts of Europe, we're seeing already very significant water stress that's beginning to affect \u2026 ordinary urban residents, not just farmers,\" he said. \"We're seeing the lack of availability for cooling water for thermal, nuclear or coal power stations, which is causing curtailment of power,\" Hare, who was speaking to CNBC's Joumanna Bercetche, said. \"This is a problem we're seeing all over the world,\" he added. \"We're seeing, also, issues for example in Germany, now in the Danube region, with low water flow, meaning you can't carry cargo anymore.\" This was in turn, \"having big implications not just for the transport of energy, but for agriculture, all manner of industrial commodities and so on.\""},

In a recent note, Charles Dumas, chief economist at U.K.-based investment research firm TS Lombard, said that action on climate change is often criticized as moving too slowly. However, with governments increasing spending to aid their post-Covid economies, they may start catching up. A key tenet of this is the ever-decreasing cost of electricity per megawatt hour, according to figures from TS Lombard, with costs of solar, offshore and onshore wind dropping over the last 10 years, while gas and coal have remained largely the same. \"Effectively by 2030 the cost of renewable electricity is going to be half that of coal and gas sourced electricity,\" Dumas told CNBC. These trends will bring many of the various pledges to reach net zero more closely in sight. The fatal floods in Germany in recent weeks have put the impacts of climate change firmly in the spotlight again but they are only the latest in a series of devastating extreme weather events of late, including the sprawling wildfires in Oregon. Amid this backdrop, the United Nations Climate Change Conference, better known as COP26, will meet in Glasgow in November. It will mark one of the most significant multilateral meetings on climate since the Paris agreement. Dumas said that as COP26 approaches, governments need to understand their key priorities, and among them should be infrastructure investments as numerous technological and engineering challenges continue to obstruct renewable energy. \"I think the intermittency problem is pretty serious and it's not just that the sun goes down at night,\" Dumas said. In the case of solar power, output can be mixed depending on the location of infrastructure like solar farms. \"There's huge variation with sunny days in winter and sunny days in the middle of summer so the intermittency takes on a very big seasonal aspect,\" Dumas said. \"You can have vicious weather for a long time in the middle of December or January and lo and behold you wouldn't want to be depending on solar power.\" Energy transmission could be another bottleneck, he said. While the developing world, including several African nations, has great potential in developing sites for generating solar power, that power needs to move easily. \"The issue of transmission technology is really major. If you want Chad to be the new Saudi Arabia, because of the Sahara Desert there's a lot of sun there, but you want the electricity to be used in Europe then you're talking about some expensive processes and processes needing a lot of research and a lot of further investment.\" Storage and carbon capture are all areas that require hefty investment, Dumas added, if governments are to reach their net-zero targets. \"What we need is a very clear public policy lead in order to get anywhere near these net zero promises and I suspect that actually what it's going to be about is a carbon tax, which the Americans may resist but will be necessary,\" he said. Paul Steele, chief economist at an independent policy research institute called the International Institute for Environment and Development, said that climate action and renewable energy investments will serve the dual purpose of tackling the climate crisis while creating jobs for the post-Covid economy. \"One of the priorities coming out of Covid is to create labor intensive employment. Both in developed and developing countries, you can provide labor intensive employment through renewable energy,\" Steele said. One example, he said, was the retrofitting of boilers in homes in the U.K., which would help push the country toward its climate targets and create new jobs while being relatively inexpensive in the grand scheme of things. Steele said that investments to drive a climate-friendly economy cannot be short term or have quick goals. He pointed to the various government support schemes for the airline industry, which has been battered by the pandemic. Just this week, the European courts gave the nod to a $2.9 billion bailout for Air France-KLM's Dutch business. Bailout funds like these should be tied to sustainability commitments by the airline industry, he said, but that can be a dicey proposition to get over the line. \"Governments aren't making the connections enough and traditionally treasuries and particularly the ministries of transport are still dominated by road building lobbies and people who like to build highways and increase transport rather than people who want to invest in sustainable alternatives.\"  "},

The local government approvals allow Baidu's Apollo Go robotaxi business to eliminate the cost of human personnel in some instances. The initial scale of the permits is small: 10 robotaxis divided between two suburban areas of Wuhan and Chongqing, two major Chinese cities. In April, Baidu and rival robotaxi operator Pony.ai received approval from a Beijing suburban district to operate robotaxis without a human driver. But the Chinese capital still requires human staff to sit in the robotaxi with passengers. Municipal authorities across China have issued an increasing number of permits in the last year that allow robotaxi companies to operate and charge fares in selected areas. In the U.S., Alphabet's Waymo and General Motors ' subsidiary Cruise can already run public robotaxis with no human staff in the vehicles. Laws for testing robotaxis and charging riders vary by city and state. Baidu claimed it has received more than one million orders for robotaxi rides.

Situated roughly 89 kilometers (approximately 55 miles) off the coast of Yorkshire, England, the scale of Hornsea 2 is considerable. According to Orsted, it has a capacity of more than 1.3 gigawatts and stretches across an area of 462 square kilometers \u2014 more than half the size of New York City. Hornsea 2, it added, uses Siemens Gamesa turbines with blades measuring 81 meters, or more than 265 feet. \"One revolution of the wind turbine blades can power an average UK home for 24 hours,\" the company says. It is the latest step forward for the Hornsea 2 project, which generated its first power in Dec. 2021. The development comes as European countries attempt to wean themselves off Russian fossil fuels, including gas, following the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine in February. \"Current global events highlight more than ever the importance of landmark renewable energy projects like Hornsea 2, helping the UK increase the security and resilience of its energy supply and drive down costs for consumers by reducing dependence on expensive fossil fuels,\" said Duncan Clark, head of the U.K. region at Orsted. The U.K. is home to a mature offshore wind sector that looks set to expand in the coming years, with authorities aiming for up to 50 GW of capacity by 2030. The European Union, which the U.K. left in January 2020, has previously laid out a 300 GW target for offshore wind by the middle of this century. Across the Atlantic, the U.S. has a long way to go to catch up with Europe. America's first offshore wind facility, the 30 megawatt Block Island Wind Farm, only started commercial operations in late 2016. Change is coming, however, and in Nov. 2021 ground was broken on a project dubbed the United States' \"first commercial scale offshore wind farm.\""},

As economies reopened after the pandemic, companies in the hospitality, retail and entertainment sectors ramped up hiring, said Feon Ang, Asia-Pacific managing director at the professional networking platform. All three countries saw an increase in job postings on LinkedIn for jobs in the accommodation sector, such as hotels, motels, casino hotels and bed-and-breakfast inns. According to data collected by LinkedIn, paid job postings for careers in Australia, India and Singapore increased in June compared to a year ago, with the following sectors seeing the most growth: 1. Accommodation, up 62%\n2. Retail jobs, up 46%\n3. Financial services, up 25% 1. Accommodation, up 65%\n2. Construction, up 40%\n3. Real estate and equipment rental services, up 25% 1. Accommodation, up 15%\n2. Transport and logistics, up 31%\n3. Entertainment providers (businesses involved in performances, events, and exhibitions), up 100% However, jobs in Singapore's health care, education and construction industries were all down by more than 30%, according to LinkedIn. Ang noted that the cutback of job postings for Singapore's construction sector was likely due to measures introduced by the government to cool the private and residential property market. Although there's an increase in hiring rates across the three countries, there was less competition among job seekers in June compared to one year ago, LinkedIn data showed. On average, there was a more than a 50% drop in applications for paid job postings on LinkedIn in Australia, India and Singapore \"Even as job postings rise, workers are being more selective in picking their next role, and so competition for jobs on average is down,\" said Ang. \"This means that workers are in a position to demand more out of work, and have higher expectations of what they want in a job \u2013 and that's a healthy sign,\" she added. In both Australia and Singapore, paid job postings that offered remote work options fell. Paid listings in Australia fell by 8% in June compared to a year ago, although sentiment for flexible working arrangements was still strong. Opportunities that offered remote working options received two times more applications on average, according to LinkedIn. In Singapore, paid job postings that allowed employees to work from home fell from 8% in the first quarter to 6.7% in the second quarter. But unlike employees in Australia, LinkedIn observed that interest in flexible working arrangements seemed to be waning in Singapore. Employers in India felt differently, according to the data. Paid job postings in the South Asian country which offered remote work options remained relatively constant throughout the year and there wasn't particularly more interest in jobs with remote options. \"Postings with remote options received only 1.1x more applications on average relative to their absolute share of all job postings in both quarters,\" said LinkedIn."},

The employees, who spoke with CNBC on the condition of anonymity, said since they have been asked to return to offices, infections notifications pop up in their email inboxes regularly. Employees are reacting with frustration and memes. The company began requiring most employees to return to physical offices at least three days a week in April. Since then, staffers have pushed back on the mandate after they worked efficiently for so long at home while the company enjoyed some of its fastest revenue growth in 15 years. Google has offered full-time employees the option to request permanent remote work, but it's unclear how many workers have been approved. Google\u2019s Covid-19 outbreak in Los Angeles is currently the largest of any employer in LA., according to the city\u2019s public health dashboard. Deadline.com first reported that the tech giant\u2019s trendy Silicon Beach campus in Venice, Calif., recorded 145 infections while 135 cases were recorded at the company\u2019s large Playa Vista campus. A spokesperson for Google told CNBC, \"There has not been a significant increase of onsite COVID-19 transmission on our campuses. The numbers that have been reported in Playa Vista and Venice reflect total cases over the last few months, not current or active cases.\" Staffers have been filling Memegen, an internal company image-sharing site, with memes about the increased number of exposure notifications they're receiving. One meme, which was upvoted 2,840 times, showed a photo of an inbox with the email subject from a San Francisco-based facilities manager stating \u201cWe\u2019re so excited to see you back in the office!\u201d and a subsequent email subject line stating \u201cNotification of Confirmed COVID-19 Case.\u201d Another meme with hundreds of upvotes said \u201cHow it started\u201d with an image of a rainbow arch followed by \u201cHow it\u2019s going\u201d and a wall of text saying \u201cNotification of confirmed Covid-19 case.\u201d Another featured an illustration of a happy Pokemon touring a Bay Area campus next to another photo of a worried Pokemon after getting a Covid-19 notification followed by an alarmed Pokemon with 29 exposure notifications. Another meme shows a picture of Star Wars character Rey, whose caption says \u201cI didn\u2019t know there was this much \u2018Notification of Confirmed COVID-19 Cases\u2019 in the whole galaxy.\u201d Some employees said they received a spike in notifications from the Mountain View, Calif. headquarters and in San Francisco offices after the company held a return-to-office celebration, where Grammy award-winning artist Lizzo performed for thousands of employees at the Shoreline Amphitheater, near Google's main campus. The spokesperson for Google also noted that the company follows methodology laid out by state and local laws in determining the definition of a Covid outbreak, and when to send exposure emails. Last December, Google told employees that they must comply with vaccine policies or they'd face losing pay and then losing their job. Then in February, ahead of asking employees to come back, it relaxed rules around vaccines being a requirement for employment, as well as other rules around testing, social distancing and masks. But it continued to require Covid-19 vaccination to enter physical offices. Now, some Google employees are asking the company to drop the vaccine mandate, arguing Covid-19 outbreaks keep happening anyway in the offices where employees are fully vaccinated. While it still provides a level of protection, the vaccines aren't as strong against the highly transmissible BA.5 variant, the fastest-spreading variant of Covid-19 to date, the group argues in a manifesto called \u201cNo Vaccine Mandate,\" which was posted this month and viewed by CNBC. (The vaccines are still providing good protection against severe disease and death, including with the BA.5 variant, but are not providing substantial protection against infection or mild illness.) The anonymous manifesto says the group, which calls itself Googlers for No Vaccine Mandate, is frustrated that non-vaccinated employees and those who decline to declare their vaccination status are still banned from offices and other gatherings including off-sites, summits and team events. It also claims that some Google employees still haven't met their teams since March 2020 and some were never notified of the vaccination policy during their hiring process. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen waves of Covid-particularly since December 2021 with Omicron and its sub variants spread through Google offices with little regard for vaccination status. We\u2019ve seen many fully vaccinated and boosted colleagues call out sick for multiple days with Covid. We\u2019ve seen both panics and good natured responses to the flood of exposure notifications received by officegoers.\" Other companies that once mandated Covid vaccination requirements have since dropped them, including Boeing, Intel, and United Airlines, citing a federal court\u2019s decision to prohibit enforcement of the federal contractor executive order that required vaccination of large employers that are also government contractors. The group's manifesto says it is hoping Google leadership does the same thing. The group is largely anonymous, although some members' identities are known to CNBC. It claims to include hundreds of employees with tenures of up to 10 years, in roles such as engineering, program management, UX design, education, sales, marketing and finance. It also includes Googlers who are fully vaccinated and \u201cbelieve the company\u2019s vaccine policy is an invasion of privacy and is insensitive to individual circumstances and risk factors.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re writing to ask for your help for a group of Googlers who still aren\u2019t allowed back to our offices,\" the memo states. \u201cWe are reaching out to you as colleagues and peers because our direct appeals to Google leadership have been ignored. When planning an in-person meeting, summit or offsite, think about how Googlers who are barred from full participation by the vaccine policy can be acknowledged and included.\""},

Here\u2019s how to use them", "tag": "Tech", "author": "Sofia Pitt", "datetime": "2022-08-26 17:05:38", "paragraphs": " You use your iPhone every day, but you might only be scratching the surface of what you can do with it. For instance, the iPhone has a bunch of \"hidden\" menus that help you do things like search across apps, go back to the last screen, find widgets that show snapshots of certain information, or quickly turn your Wi-Fi off and on. They're hidden because they require you to make specific gestures that aren't necessarily easy to guess. But once you know where they are, they're quite useful. Apple adds more functions to the iPhone every year. The company announced Wednesday that it's hosting a fall event on Sept. 7 that's almost certainly for the iPhone 14. We'll also probably hear when its next update, iOS 16, will be released to everyone. And that'll bring even more features. Here's a quick overview to get you going. Many apps on the iPhone have hidden menus called Quick Actions. All you have to do is hold down the icon for the app you want to see the Quick Action menu for. Apps that come pre-installed on your iPhone, like the Camera, Mail, Notes, Settings, Messages and Phone apps have these menus. Accessing them can help you perform actions on apps quickly. Each Quick Actions menu has functions that make sense for that app. All you do is just press and hold down on the icon on your home screen. For example if you hold down the Notes icon, a Quick Actions menu will pop up that gives you shortcuts to draft a new note, create a new checklist, insert a new photo, or scan a document. Here's what it looks like: If you hold down the Phone app icon, a Quick Actions menu will pop up that gives you the option to view your most recent voicemail, create a new contact, search for a contact, or view your most recent call. Here's what the Phone Quick Actions menu looks like: If you have small hands like me, you may have noticed it's hard to access all of your iPhones functions one-handed. You can quickly access the icons at the top of the phone without stretching your fingers with an option called \"Reachability.\" This lowers the screen down so you don't have to fumble with two hands. Reachability is off by default, so do this to turn it on: Now that it's on, use it by quickly swiping down at the bottom edge of the screen. The key word here is quickly. Here's what the screen looks like once you've enabled Reachability. I find myself using Reachability when I'm cooking with one hand and trying to use my iPhone with the other and can't stretch my thumb all the way to the top of my screen. You probably already know how to swipe down from the top middle of your home screen. That's what brings up your recent notifications. But, if you're coming from an iPhone with a home button, you might not know that you can also swipe down from the top right corner of your screen (or up from the bottom if your iPhone has a home button.) This opens Control Center, which gives you quick access controls to common functions. You can use it to turn on your flashlight, to recognize a song with Shazam, control your smart lights, toggle Wi-Fi or Bluetooth on/off, launch the calculator and more. But you have to set it up so it has the right items in it. To manage what appears in Control Center, do this: You can place little mini apps, called widgets, on your home screen. But there's also a whole hidden section dedicated to widgets. This is to the left of your home screen, so you access it by swiping right across your screen. You can customize it with any app that has widgets. I have a photo gallery in mine and an icon that shows the battery life left on my iPhone and Apple Watch. I also use it for a quick glance at my Apple Fitness rings, CNBC Trending news stories, and stock quotes. There are two ways to get widgets on this screen. For the built-in Apple widgets, and a handful of others that have been custom-built, do this: If you don't see the widget you want to add, you might need to take an extra step. In this case: You can search through apps, the web, maps, dictionary, files and more all by using the iPhone's universal search menu. You can bring this up by swiping down from the middle of your home screen. You'll also see Siri suggestions for your most common actions. (Reminder: swiping from the middle-top will bring down notifications and swiping from the top-right will bring down Control Center.) You can quickly change apps or close them by swiping up from the bottom of the screen and then holding until you feel a gentle vibration. Swipe right to move through apps. Tap an app to switch to it, or swipe up to close it. Here's a little bonus trick: did you know you can switch between apps by also just swiping right or left across the bottom of the screen? Try it! Open an app and then swipe right across the bottom. It'll go to the last app you had open. Swipe left to go back or keep swiping right to move between apps Here's a second bonus: You can go back to the last screen in an app, like the previous webpage, by swiping right from the edge of the screen. The best way to try this is to open a website, go to another site, and then swipe right across the screen. You'll be back where you started. If you swipe left from the right side of your phone, you'll move forward again."},

Toyota Battery Manufacturing North Carolina is set to start operations in 2025, with the firm stating that total investment in the plant will now amount to $3.8 billion. Norm Bafunno, who is senior vice president, unit manufacturing and engineering at Toyota Motor North America, said the announcement marked \"another significant milestone\" for the business. The additional investment in the U.S. is part of a wider investment of up to $5.6 billion in battery production, with Toyota noting that demand for battery electric vehicles was growing. To this end, the business said it would aim to ramp up \"combined battery production capacity\" in the U.S. and Japan by as much as 40 gigawatt hours. As well as diesel and gasoline vehicles, Toyota is known for its hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell offerings. It is also attempting to make headway in the increasingly competitive battery-electric market, where firms like Tesla and Volkswagen are jostling for position. This has not been without its challenges. In June 2022, Toyota issued a safety recall for more than 2,000 of its all-electric SUV, the bZ4X. Toyota may be looking to invest billions in EV battery production, but on Wednesday the business stressed it would also \"continue to make every effort to flexibly meet the needs\" of customers \"in all countries and regions by offering multiple powertrains and providing as many options as possible.\" Indeed, the website of Toyota Europe states that the \"internal combustion engine continues to be the most popular means of powering vehicles and it will continue to play a role for the next 20 to 30 years.\" All the above comes at a time when major economies are laying out plans to reduce the environmental footprint of road-based transportation. Just this month, the California Air Resources Board approved a rule that will require all new car sales in the state to be zero emission by the year 2035. Elsewhere, the U.K. wants to stop the sale of new diesel and gasoline cars and vans by 2030. It will require, from 2035, all new cars and vans to have zero-tailpipe emissions. The European Union \u2014 which the U.K. left on Jan. 31, 2020 \u2014 is pursuing similar targets. According to the International Energy Agency, electric vehicle sales hit 6.6 million in 2021. In the first quarter of 2022, EV sales came to 2 million, a 75% increase compared to the first three months of 2021."},

Some people were able to unlock the Pixel 6a using fingers they hadn't registered in the device's settings. And two YouTube channels have demonstrated that people could unlock a Pixel 6a even when their fingerprints hadn't been saved in the phone. As a rule, both consumers and corporate workers want to keep what's on their devices private. People will expect that their devices will not inadvertently allow access to strangers or even friends or family members. That means this issue isn't the best thing to happen for Google's fast-growing Pixel line of smartphones that take on Apple's iPhones and myriad Android phones. Google shipped 800,000 smartphones in the U.S. in the second quarter, up some 230% year over, according to estimates published on Monday by technology industry research group Canalys. Apple, Samsung, Motorola and TCL all shipped more phones in North America than Google, Canalys said. The $449 Pixel 6a contains the same Google Tensor chip as the Pixel 6 from 2021, which Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google parent Alphabet, told analysts in April is \"the fastest-selling Pixel ever.\" The A line of Pixel phones such as the Pixel 6a is meant to deliver similar technology as Google's flagship models at a lower price. People can set up the Pixel 6a without enabling the fingerprint unlock feature, but it's still a popular alternative to a passcode. \"The under-display fingerprint sensor in Pixel 6a was tested to meet the industry standard for security where the probability of an unverified fingerprint match is 1 in 50,000 attempts,\" a Google spokesperson told CNBC in an email. \"We continually make improvements to our fingerprint performance, stability, and reliability, and users should ensure they are running the latest version of Android 13.\" Apple says on its website that the probability of two separate fingerprints matching a single finger enrolled in its Touch ID technology is one in 50,000. The odds of correctly guessing a person's four-digit passcode to unlock a device, for the sake of comparison, is one in 10,000. Authentication issues have cropped up on phones from other manufacturers that have relied on face recognition. Family members who weren't exactly alike managed to unlock Apple's iPhone X in 2017, and in 2019 people discovered that it was possible to unlock Samsung's Galaxy S10 with a photo of the phone's owner. While it's rare, I still found it frightening that someone else's fingerprint unlocked my phone. If you're also worried about it, you might want to just rely on another authentication method instead.

He was speaking at the 2022 Global Supertrends Conference. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced in May that the country will take firm steps to restart idled nuclear power plants to stabilize energy supply and prices. In 2011, the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant was hit by a massive earthquake and tsunami, which killed nearly 16,000 people and caused the world's worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986. Though there have been reservations among the Japanese public over the use of nuclear energy, particularly when it comes to the issue of safety, Tanaka said the future of nuclear power is now safer, and stressed the importance of minimizing risk and maintaining \"peaceful use.\" Tanaka attributed the increase in public support to the possibility of \"serious problems by the end of this year\" if Japan does not have nuclear power. He added that Russia supplies 9% of Japan's natural gas, and losing that supply could spell trouble for the country as it would have to turn to alternative sources, which would lead to a spike in energy prices. Japan has repeatedly criticized Russian aggression in Ukraine and has slapped Moscow with economic sanctions. In response, Russia sanctioned over 300 Japanese lawmakers in July. Russia recently cut gas supplies to Europe via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to just a fifth of its capacity. Moscow has repeatedly denied it is weaponizing fossil fuel supplies over the Russia-Ukraine war. Tanaka said that Japan wants to secure energy supplies but also work toward reaching carbon neutrality by 2050, and striking that balance could prove increasingly challenging. Nuclear power has been touted as an important option for decarbonization.\n\"Japan is trying to secure the supply of energy, especially electricity, while trying to maintain the targets of carbon neutral by 2050 intact. So this is really (a) challenge for Japan to do many things,\" he said."},

First, its much-hyped effort with JPMorgan and Berkshire Hathaway to reform health care, Haven, ended its short life. Now, Amazon Care, its effort to tackle telemedicine and primary care for the employer market on a national basis \u2013 which Amazon itself trumpeted as gaining more and more clients \u2013 is being shut down.\nIs that all the proof we needed of what many people have said over the years: health care is just harder to disrupt than most industries? Maybe not, though maybe it is a signal of a change in the approach to how Amazon will attempt to gobble up more health industry market share. The shutdown of Amazon Care may come back to a simple choice that companies, especially those with a lot of cash, have to make when it comes to breaking into new markets: build or buy? For some health-care industry watchers, it's no surprise that Amazon Care is going away as a stand-alone entity. When Amazon made the decision in July to acquire primary care company One Medical, which does what Amazon Care was hoping to ultimately do on a national basis, it was the writing on the wall that something was going to change. And for a cash-rich company looking for opportunities to buy into a stock market that had pushed down the value of recently public health companies \u2013 One Medical had traded as high as $58 in 2021 and Amazon announced plans to buy it for $18 a share \u2013 Amazon may have been more opportunistic than anything else in plotting the next stage of its future in health. Buying into a market where it wants more share and where it requires a physical presence isn't new to Amazon, nor is being opportunistic in the timing. As Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods reaches the five-year mark, it's worth remembering that Amazon's shares went up in value as much on the day it announced the acquisition of Whole Foods as the purchase price for the then-troubled high-end grocer. \"It's not surprising they're shutting it down,\" said Sari Kaganoff, general manager of consulting at Rock Health, which invests as a VC in health start-ups and has a health advisory and research arm. \"Their vision always was to have a primary care integrated solution and now it will have a better solution than what they could build,\" Kaganoff said. It was a little surprising, maybe, that Amazon announced the shutdown before the One Medical deal even closed, but One Medical has many more markets, many more offices and many more companies that are clients than Amazon ever did (it had to boast about signing up Whole Foods, which it owns, as a client for Amazon Care). Maybe also surprising: it didn't wait to rebrand One Medical as part of Amazon Care. PillPack, its acquisition in the pharmacy space, still has a brand but is now folded within Amazon Pharmacy. By Amazon's own account, Amazon Care was a failure, at least in the terms conveyed in the internal memo provided to the press about the shuttering. There's no doubt it struggled with the problem of building up an in-person care component nationwide, staffing up in a sector where it has limited history, and getting corporate customers to sign on. While telemedicine is a nice have, it's not a full health-care solution, and Amazon would have had to ramp up investment considerably to build a true national hybrid health-care practice with sites and physicians and clinics. In the end, let's say Amazon Care was a test run for a business, and once Amazon learned enough to know what it wanted in the long-term, it bought the better company at a time when its value was depressed. \"I don't think they failed, because One Medical is great,\" Kaganoff said. Amazon learned a lesson that has influenced the fortunes of many health disruptors in recent years: it's hard to make a stand-alone startup work in the sector \u2014 even if you're one of the richest companies in the world \u2014 consolidation is increasingly the way to go. \"Amazon Care was no different than any other stand-alone health startup in terms of needing to be consolidated,\" Kaganoff said. \"They played around with it a bit,\" she added, enough to know their ambitions remain validated on the market, but just not the way there. \"One of the ways we've worked towards this vision for the past several years has been with our urgent and primary care service offering, Amazon Care. During that time, we've gathered and listened to extensive feedback from our enterprise customers and their employees, and evolved the service to continuously improve the experience for customers. However, despite these efforts, we've determined that Amazon Care isn't the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers,\" the internal memo said. While Amazon's health-care efforts in recent years have been associated with direct battles to unseat recent health disruptors (e.g., Amazon Care vs. Teladoc), Wall Street analysts have said the market should worry more about Amazon making a string of acquisitions that speak to broader aims. That's what seems to be happening. Amazon isn't done yet pushing its cash around in buying more in health-care, with recent headlines reporting it is among bidders for Signify Health, which has an overlap with the Iora Health business of One Medical, focused on a more complicated, Medicare-centric market than standard national care practices. It's clear Amazon still plans to be a formidable player in the health-care space. It can leverage its ability to personalize its offerings, connect to its pharmacy, and ultimately pose a threat to many other retail giants aiming to upend healthcare. Walmart acquired telehealth company MeMD in 2021; CVS, which already offers telemedicine through a deal with American Well, is another rumored bidder for Signify; and Walgreens has VillageMD and is opening up hundreds of offices in markets around the country. That retail disruption is only going to grow, for a bottom-line reason. When you look at the share of wallet, from consumers to employers, the health-care market is a big part of spending. Amazon is already in almost every chunk of the wallet, maybe not banking (though it does have credit cards). What's the biggest chunk of the market they are not in? \"It's healthcare, and they already have so many things consumer-health oriented, it just makes sense to go big in health care,\" Kaganoff said. When Haven \u2014 which disbanded after three years \u2014 debuted to much fanfare, people thought the combined might of Berkshire Hathaway, JPMorgan and Amazon could result in a significant driving down of costs throughout the health-care system that Warren Buffett has called a tapeworm on the national economy. And that's still part of the story. Anything Amazon does is partially about driving down cost and driving up efficiency. \"Better care at a lower cost,\" is what Cano Health CEO Marlow Hernandez told CNBC last week is the paradigm shift for all players in the space. Amazon's consumer internet business may be the ultimate in transactional disruptors, but the transactional system of health care is under threat and people don't want to treat it like just another form of retail. \"What patients have been demanding is that integrated platform where they can build relationships and no longer be a number,\" Hernandez said. That's referred to as value-based care \u2014 and maybe it is a sign of just how messed up the U.S. health-care system is that \"value\" for patient is a novel idea \u2014 and it is leading to a lot of consolidation. Hernandez projects the primary care market will grow from $1.8 trillion to $3.7 trillion by 2030. And that speaks to the underlying aim for any big company like Amazon and its rivals. \"I think it's just market share,\" Kaganoff said. The end of Amazon Care did seem abrupt. But as Amazon moves from primary care, into more complicated care, and potentially even chronic care \u2013 and combines pharmacy and over-the-counter medication with all its offerings \u2013 everyone from private health start-ups to Teladoc to retail competitors and health-care incumbents should continue to worry. Amazon Care's failure may have come at a cost and may have come as a surprise, even to some within Amazon, but what the company ultimately is buying and building off may still make it the stronger disruptor."},

Founded in 2009, Rivian is focusing on upscale electric trucks and SUVs with an emphasis on outdoor adventure. CNBC's John Rosevear calls them the \"Patagonia of electric vehicles.\" Rivian launched its first vehicle, the R1T electric truck, at the end of last year. It's been working to scale up production and is planning to ship its SUV \u2014 the R1S \u2014 built off of the same platform, later this year. It's been a long and arduous road to get to this point. But Rivian has received some major assistance, including $700 million from Amazon in 2019 and $500 million from Ford a few months later. Initially, Rivian and Ford sought to develop a joint vehicle together, but the companies ended up canceling those plans. However, the partnership with Amazon is still on track. Following its investment, Amazon said it would purchase 100,000 custom-built electric delivery vans, part of its move to electrify its last-mile fleet by 2040. When Rivian went public in November 2021, it had one of the largest IPOs in U.S. history. But the turbulent economy has cast a shadow over its rocketing success.

The sister of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was speaking at the Global Supertrends Conference 2022 on Wednesday. The Web3 is a hypothetical, future version of the internet based on blockchain technology \u2014 an \"ideal utopia,\" said Zuckerberg. \"But \u2026 that's not what's happening. What's happening in reality, is chaos.\" The founder and CEO of Zuckerberg Media, a production company and marketing consultancy, added, \"You're the only one watching your own back and your own assets, people are spending time protecting themselves by setting up so many different wallets and protecting their identity and that's not contributing to development in the area.\" Zuckerberg, who was an early employee at Meta \u2014 formerly known as Facebook \u2014 explained that various metaverses are now acting as \"their own walled garden,\" in which users are unable to use their assets across platforms. The metaverse can be loosely defined as a virtual world where people live, work and play. With cryptocurrency, users can buy and develop virtual land or dress their own avatars. \"Right now, I'm on Decentraland, my son is on Roblox, my other son is on Fortnite. That's great \u2014 we're all in the metaverse. [But] we have no interaction with one another,\" she said. \"In order to really unlock the potential [of Web3], we're going to need to figure out a system where there's interoperability. What you have goes with you wherever you are, [and] we're not there yet,\" Zuckerberg added. However, according to Zuckerberg, that's easier said than done because no company running a metaverse right now wants to give up control or \"share that ownership.\" \"That's why it's not we're not seeing that kind of consumer mainstream adoption yet because there needs to be a world where you leave the house with one wallet. And you need to see that same behavior online also.\" She added that Web3 needs experts who have been involved in the global banking system and Web2 \u2014 the internet that we know today \u2014 to lend a \"protective layer.\" The need for such experts is all the more important because it has been \"too easy\" for users to be scammed or lose all their assets in Web3, said Zuckerberg. \"There needs to be more protections for consumers \u2026 I think we will wind up [with] web 2.7, where there is some centralization, keeping people safe, but the ability to port your assets with you to any site.\" Another thing that needs to be improved in Web3 is user-friendliness, she added. \"It should not take 45 steps to set up a cryptocurrency wallet, buy a currency and enter the metaverse. It needs to [be] one-stop, beginner-friendly.\" The metaverse may still be in its infancy, but Zuckerberg pointed out that sectors like real estate will be \"extremely valuable.\" \"Wherever there's scarcity \u2026 there's value. I think the big question will just be, is there scarcity in the metaverse and if there is, there will be value in real estate there,\" she added. According to data from MetaMetrics Solutions, real estate sales in the metaverse surpassed $500 million in 2021 and could double in 2022. Zuckerberg said that education and training will be another \"huge area\" for opportunities and revenue. \"Especially in this new age where workers are remote, it is very difficult to upskill remote workers \u2026 I think training in the metaverse, education in an interactive way, is going to become crucial for every business that has a remote work,\" she added. \"We're really just scratching the surface of what we're going to see.\""},

But as the world's two largest economies pour resources into the race for dominance in the field, there's also collaboration afoot. Indeed, some AI experts even say that cross-border cooperation is key to getting the most out of advancements in computing. Engineers from Microsoft and China's ByteDance, the parent of TikTok, are doing their part to advance that notion. Through a project called KubeRay, they're working together on software intended to help companies more efficiently run AI apps. At the Ray Summit this week in San Francisco, ByteDance software engineer Jiaxin Shan and Microsoft principal software engineer Ali Kanso discussed their progress with data scientists, machine learning experts and other developers interested in building large applications using open source software called Ray. Shan and Kanso explained the technical details behind KubeRay and pitched the software as helpful in powering AI apps that run on multiple computers, or distributed computing. \"Jiaxin and I have been working for like a year on an open source project and this is the beauty of a community gathering like this,\" said Kanso, who has a Ph.D. in computer science. \"We're not in the same company, but we meet every week, we collaborate every week.\" Shan, who previously worked as a software engineer at Amazon Web Services, is based in the Seattle area, near Microsoft's headquarters, according to his LinkedIn profile. Companies often partner and share engineering resources to contribute to open source projects, which have gained popularity in recent years and have seeded numerous startups. The Microsoft-ByteDance collaboration is notable because of the brewing rivalry between the U.S. and China with respect to AI and intellectual property, and concerns over how technological advancements could be used for surveillance and privacy intrusion. Microsoft has been investing heavily in AI along with competitors like Amazon, Google parent Alphabet, Facebook parent Meta and Apple. Like Google once did, Microsoft maintains an AI research lab in China, helping it tap into the country's academic talent. Meanwhile, as TikTok's usage has exploded in recent years, ByteDance has been diving into various AI open source projects. In 2020, for instance, ByteDance debuted its NeurST software tool kit for AI-powered speech translation. And last year the company debuted its CloudWeGo open source enterprise software. The Ray Summit was organized by software startup Anyscale, whose technology is built on Ray. Anyscale, which also contributed to KubeRay, was co-founded in 2019 by a group of engineers that included Ion Stoica, a computer science professor at the University of California at Berkeley. Stoica has a long history in open source software and co-founded Databricks, a data analytics company that was valued at $38 billion in a financing round last year. Databricks was built on top of Apache Spark, which was developed at Berkeley under Stoica's direction. Anyscale is trying to follow a similar path, and said this week that it's just raised a fresh $99 million. Tech giants like Microsoft and Meta often use open source projects as a way to propagate their own internal technological ideas to the wider community. Doing so helps lure potential recruits and serves as way to market the companies as technology leaders to developers. The Microsoft-ByteDance relationship has some history to it. In 2020, Microsoft sought to acquire TikTok from ByteDance at a time when then-President Donald Trump threatened to ban the social media app over unspecified security reasons. A year later, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella called the botched deal \"the strangest thing\" he's ever worked on. WATCH: Former TikTok CEO Kevin Mayer on ByteDance decision to scrap IPO plans"},

The agency was slated to launch its Artemis I mission from the Kennedy Space Center during a two-hour launch window that opened at 8:33 a.m. ET, sending the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and Orion capsule on a more than monthlong journey around the moon. But NASA was unable to resolve a temperature problem identified with one of the four liquid-fueled engines, discovered with under two hours to go in the countdown. The uncrewed launch marks the debut of the most powerful rocket ever assembled and kicks off NASA's long-awaited return to the moon's surface. It's the first mission in NASA's Artemis lunar program, which is expected to land the agency's astronauts on the moon by its third mission in 2025. While Artemis I will not carry astronauts, nor land on the moon, the mission is critical to demonstrating that NASA's monster rocket and deep space capsule can deliver on their promised abilities. Artemis I has been delayed for years, with the program running billions over budget. NASA has backup launch dates scheduled for Sept. 2 and Sept. 5, but officials during a press conference on Monday afternoon couldn't say whether the engine issue will be fixed before either of those dates. \"There's a non-zero chance we'll have a launch on Friday,\" NASA's Artemis mission manager Mike Sarafin told reporters, before adding \"we really need time to look at all the information, all the data.\" NASA's team is expected to meet on Tuesday afternoon to identify the next steps for Artemis I. If a launch attempt in the next week isn't possible, the SLS rocket may need to be rolled off the launchpad for what would likely be a lengthy delay. The possibility of moving the rocket off the launchpad \"is getting ahead of our data reviews,\" Sarafin said. \"If we can resolve this operationally at the pad then there won't be any need for that.\" Sarafin also noted the engine temperature problem was a known risk, as the agency had not fully completed a fueling test known as a \"wet dress rehearsal\" after four attempts this year. The agency also found a hydrogen leak in the engines and a crack in the thermal protection system material that safeguards the core of the rocket during the countdown Monday \u2014 though those issues were resolved before the launch was called off for the day."},

Ever since the conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court revoked the constitutional right for a woman to obtain an abortion, Democrats have seen a boost in donations, polling and performance in special elections for open congressional seats. The latest came Tuesday in a Hudson Valley swing district that, in a Republican wave year, should have been an easy GOP win. Instead, Democratic Ulster County executive Pat Ryan defeated his Republican counterpart from Duchess County, Marc Molinaro. The stakes, governing-wise, were small \u2014 the seat will disappear in the fall as a new congressional map goes into effect. But because the race became a referendum on abortion after the high court's ruling, the political implications are huge. It comes after a ballot measure to ban the procedure was crushed in solidly conservative Kansas. Republicans were anticipating a typical midterm landslide, with inflation high and President Joe Biden's approval rating low. It may still end up a solid GOP year, but Ryan's win is the latest indication that Democrats don't have to abandon hope. One Florida politician wasn't facing a primary challenge on Tuesday but made sure to dominate the news anyway \u2014 DeSantis. DeSantis is considered former President Donald Trump's top rival for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, partly due to the way he's leaned into political and cultural divides in the Sunshine State. On Tuesday he demonstrated why. The governor began the day with a Cabinet meeting, which included the only Democrat elected statewide in Florida, Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried. She was competing for her party's nomination to face DeSantis that evening. DeSantis shook Fried's hand as the meeting concluded and told her \"good luck\" before criticizing her campaign and predicting \u2014 accurately, it turned out \u2014 her loss in brief remarks to reporters. \"I think that you know she had an opportunity as being the only Democrat elected statewide to exercise some leadership and maybe get some things done and instead she's used her time to try and smear me on a daily basis, that's all she does,\" DeSantis said of Fried. After polls closed in the evening, DeSantis grabbed the spotlight again, speaking to a crowd in Miami. \"We're not going to let this state be overrun by woke ideology, we will fight the woke in the business, we will fight the woke in government agencies, we will fight the woke in our schools,\" DeSantis said. \"We will never, ever surrender to the woke agenda. Florida is the state where woke goes to die.\" Expect to hear a lot more like that from DeSantis in the months \u2014 and possibly years \u2014 ahead. Florida and New York, which held primary elections Tuesday, were two of the states whose legislative maps were most radically redrawn this year to favor one political party. It was part of a centuries-old political gambit known as gerrymandering. But Tuesday night showed two different sides of gerrymandering. The New York map that Democrats redrew to ruthlessly target vulnerable Republicans got tossed out by the state's highest court as an illegal partisan act. The map was redrawn to be more balanced, disregarding the political fortunes of some of New York's most prominent members of Congress and lumping several high-profile lawmakers in the same district in a push for equity. Ignoring scattered protests that its April ruling came too late in the process to change the map, the high court moved the state's congressional primary to Tuesday, two months after its June primary for state offices. That's why New York's Democratic primaries Tuesday were so fractious and chaotic. In contrast, Florida's Republican-appointed State Supreme Court declined to change the partisan map that DeSantis pushed the Republican-controlled Florida legislature to approve. Unlike the New York court, the Florida court declined to mess with the map close to the election. As a result, Florida's incumbent House members generally stayed put Tuesday night, not forced into any career-ending primary battles because of districts being moved. The great exception was Rep. Charlie Crist, who ran for \u2014 and won \u2014 the Democratic nomination for governor partly because DeSantis' map transformed his district into a solidly Republican one. The new map also effectively eliminated two seats, currently represented in Washington by Black Democrats, where African Americans comprise the largest share of voters. Nationally, both parties tried to gerrymander during the past redistricting cycle, but Democrats were reined in slightly more than Republicans \u2014 largely due to Florida and New York. Florida's top court may change that in the coming years when it rules on challenges to DeSantis' maps. Meanwhile, the U.S. Supreme Court is considering multiple cases that could change the ability of courts to redistrict gerrymanders. That may help determine whether we see more congressional primaries like New York's, or more like Florida's. It's been muted by the spectacle of Trump's makeover of the GOP, but Democrats also spent the primary season torn over the direction of their party. Left-wing contenders continued to mount primary challenges to centrist Democrats. The left lost its most prominent bids to dislodge incumbent House members in south Texas and Cleveland. Two new losses came Tuesday, when a liberal state senator was crushed by Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney in a congressional primary north of New York City. And attorney Dan Goldman, who worked on Trump's first impeachment, narrowly beat a bevy of more progressive rivals in a primary for a congressional seat centered in Brooklyn. But the left has won some victories this primary season, nabbing a nomination for a House seat in Pennsylvania and seeing one of its favorite politicians, that state's Lieutenant Governor John Fetterman, win the party's nomination for Senate. Neither side has been crushed, so expect more left-on-center primaries next election cycle. Trump set out to demonstrate his dominance of the GOP this primary season, and he succeeded \u2014 to a point. His approval helped set the party's Senate field and was pivotal in a number of hotly contested primaries. He claimed his biggest prize last week, when his chosen candidate beat Rep. Liz Cheney in Wyoming's Republican primary. On Tuesday, Trump's chosen candidate, Air Force veteran and conservative activist Anna Luna, won her primary in an open GOP-leaning seat on Florida's Gulf Coast. But Trump had some huge humiliations \u2014 especially when he tried to intervene in governor's races in Idaho, Nebraska and especially Georgia, where Trump failed to oust Gov. Brian Kemp for refusing to overturn the 2020 election in his state and award it to Trump. Even more significantly, Trump elevated candidates who may not be able to win competitive races \u2014 or may even pose a threat to democracy itself. Last week, the GOP's Senate leader, Mitch McConnell, warned that his party may not win a Senate majority due to \"candidate quality\" among its nominees. They include Trump-backed candidates struggling in swing states, like Herschel Walker in Georgia, JD Vance in Ohio and Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania. Others, like the GOP's nominees for Pennsylvania governor, Doug Mastriano, and Arizona governor, Kari Lake, have denied that Trump lost the 2020 election, raising questions about whether they'd certify the actual winners of future elections if they take over their statehouses. Trump does not always have to intercede for extreme candidates who have mimicked his style to rise in Republican primaries. On Tuesday, Laura Loomer, a conservative provocateur who's been banned from several social media websites for posting anti-Muslim remarks, surprised many with a strong \u2014 albeit unsuccessful \u2014 showing in a primary challenge to 73-year-old Florida Rep. Daniel Webster. Still, Trump's effect on the GOP became immeasurable this primary season. ___ This story has been corrected to show Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney defeated a liberal state senator, not an assemblywoman; and deletes reference to a Democratic-appointed court as having redrawn the map; others were involved as well."},

Zinke and his chief of staff \"made statements to [Interior's Office of the Inspector General] with the overall intent to mislead them,\" the OIG's report said. \"We found that both Secretary Zinke and the [chief of staff] made statements that presented an inaccurate version of the circumstances in which the [Interior Department] made key decisions,\" the watchdog's report added. \"As a result, we concluded that Secretary Zinke and the [chief of staff] did not comply with their duty of candor when questioned.\" Zinke's alleged lies came in response to questions about his interactions with department lawyers and employees, a U.S. senator and lobbyists for MGM Resorts International. MGM, a casino operator, sought to block an application by two Native American tribes, the Mashantucket Pequots and the Mohegans, to jointly build and run a casino in northern Connecticut. Zinke disputed the report's findings. He unsuccessfully asked the Inspector General's office to delay publicly releasing the report until after the November midterms, when he will be seeking to represent the western area of Montana in its new second House seat. In a statement Wednesday, Zinke's lawyer called the report and the timing of the release a \"political smear.\" The watchdog's findings come six months after another Inspector General's office report found the House hopeful misused his position as secretary to promote a development project in his Whitefish, Montana, hometown. Wednesday's report said the Inspector General referred the casino issue to the Justice Department in 2018, when Trump and his attorney general were still in office. The Justice Department declined to prosecute in the casino lobbying episode last year. It also chose not to prosecute in 2021 after it received the report about the Montana development. The newly released report details how MGM Resorts International actively opposed the Connecticut tribes' application in a lobbying effort targeting Zinke. MGM operates a casino just over the border in Springfield, Massachusetts. MGM's lobbyists specifically pushed Zinke not to approve amendments to the tribes' existing gaming agreements with the state of Connecticut, the report said. Connecticut required those amendments in exchange for the state approving the casino, which would operate on nontribal lands. Zinke ultimately sent the amendments back to the tribes without taking action, effectively stalling their plan. He later told Inspector General investigators \"more than 10 times that he relied on the Associate Deputy Secretary [of Interior] and the [department's Office of the Solicitor's attorneys] in making his decision to return the Tribes' amendments without action,\" the report said. But those other people did not corroborate Zinke's claims, according to the report. An unidentified U.S. senator told investigators that he asked Zinke not to approve the tribes' amendments in a September 2017 phone call. Zinke told investigators he did not recall the senator asking him to \"take a particular stance,\" according to the report. \"Based on our analysis of Secretary Zinke's statements, we concluded that he provided a misleading portrayal of the basis for his decision to return the Tribes' amendments,\" the report said. Zinke \"repeatedly stated that he had not had conversations with anyone outside the agency \u2014including the U.S. Senator or industry lobbyists \u2014 who advised him to take a different course of action,\" the report said. \"Given the number and extent of communications with these outside personnel, combined with the absence of information that anyone \u2014 counsel or otherwise \u2014 within the agency advised this course of action, we find that Secretary Zinke's description of events was not accurate,\" it added. In a statement emailed to CNBC on Wednesday, Zinke's lawyer Danny Onorato said, \"More than four years ago, Secretary Zinke cooperated fully in a politically motivated investigation conducted by the Interior Department's Inspector General.\" \"Secretary Zinke repeatedly told the Inspector General that he was not subject to any influence in that matter because he lacked jurisdiction to act on the application,\" Onorato said. \"That should have ended the inquiry. Instead, on the eve of an election, the IG has released a misleading and inaccurate report that suggested Secretary Zinke lacked candor in his interview with IG agents.\" \"That is wrong,\" the lawyer said. \"The record here shows that it was the IG's draft report that initially concealed dispositive evidence and that a Federal Judge in Washington D.C. agreed that Secretary Zinke's position was legally sound. After Secretary Zinke objected to a draft report, the IG now acknowledges this critical fact in watered down fashion.\" \"Put simply, Secretary Zinke was completely candid in his interview and was legally vindicated by the Court's decision. The content of the IG report and the timing of its release will be seen for what it is, another political smear,\" Onorato said."},

Marjorie Taylor Greene", "tag": "Politics", "author": "Kevin Breuninger", "datetime": "2022-08-24 16:05:30", "paragraphs": " Police officers showed up at Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's home overnight after an alleged opponent of her stance on transgender rights made a false 911 call, authorities in Georgia said Wednesday. The \"swatting\" call falsely claimed that a man had been shot multiple times in a bathtub at a residence in Rome, Georgia, the city's police department said in a report shared with CNBC. The Rome Police Department at 1:04 a.m. ET dispatched five officers, who learned en route that they were headed to Greene's house, the report said. They rang the doorbell and were met by the Republican congresswoman, who \"assured us there was no issue,\" the report said. A spokeswoman for the department told CNBC that the officers checked Greene's home. Afterward, the department received a second call from a suspect using a computer-generated voice who claimed responsibility for the incident. The suspect \"explained that they were upset about Ms. Greene's stance on 'trans-gender youth's rights', and stated that they were trying to 'SWAT' her,\" the police report said. The department said it is working with the U.S. Capitol Police on the investigation, which remains active. The Capitol Police declined CNBC's request for comment. Greene, a far-right lawmaker backed by former President Donald Trump, had introduced a bill in Congress last week that would make it a felony to provide gender-affirming care to transgender minors. The legislation came amid a growing right-wing movement against those treatments that recently targeted Boston Children's Hospital, which said last week that it is dealing with an influx of hostile calls and emails, including threats of violence. \"Right now, Congresswoman Greene's safety is our number one concern,\" Greene's spokesman, Nick Dyer, said in a statement to CNBC. Dyer called Greene the \"victim of a political attack on her family and home\" and also described it as a \"violent crime,\" though no violence is alleged to have occurred. Greene first revealed being swatted in a tweet. In an interview later Wednesday, Greene said she was startled by the police presence at her home, but decided not to carry a gun as she answered the door, \"which was very out of norm for me.\" The swatter endangered both her and the officers, Greene said in the interview with \"Real America's Voice,\" a conservative outlet. \"Whoever this person is, they deserve to be locked up,\" she said."},

The announcement of the upcoming military aid package, the 19th such installment, comes as Ukraine celebrates 31 years of its independence from the Soviet Union. \"The United States of America is committed to supporting the people of Ukraine as they continue the fight to defend their sovereignty,\" Biden said in a statement, acknowledging Ukraine's Independence Day. He added that that approximately $2.98 billion \"will allow Ukraine to acquire air defense systems, artillery systems and munitions, counter-unmanned aerial systems and radars to ensure it can continue to defend itself.\" The latest security assistance package is unlike presidential drawdown authorities which authorize the delivery of weapons directly from U.S. arsenals. Wednesday's package of nearly $3 billion is authorized through the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, or USAI, which uses funds appropriated by Congress. The USAI finances America's defense industry to scale up arms production. \"This announcement represents the beginning of a contracting process to provide additional priority capabilities to Ukraine in the mid-and long-term to ensure Ukraine can continue to defend itself as an independent, sovereign and prosperous state,\" wrote Pentagon press secretary Air Force Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder in a statement. The package consists of six additional National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems, or NASAMS, as well as munitions for those systems, 24 counter-artillery radars, 245,000 rounds of 155 mm artillery ammunition, 65,000 rounds of 120 mm mortar ammunition, laser-guided rocket systems, support equipment for the Scan Eagle drone as well as Puma drones. New to this security package is the counter-drone capability dubbed Vampire. It was not immediately clear how many the Pentagon would provide. Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl told reporters at the Pentagon that USAI packages can typically take months or years to deliver depending on the defense contracting process. \"This package of capabilities is really aimed at getting Ukraine what they're going to need in the medium to long term so it's not relevant to the fight today, tomorrow or next week,\" explained Kahl. \"It is relevant to the ability of Ukraine to defend itself and deter further aggression a year from now or two years from now,\" he added. Earlier this month, Biden announced a presidential drawdown authority of $9.8 billion for Ukraine, the biggest weapons installment to come directly from U.S. stockpiles. So far, the U.S. has committed more than $13.5 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since January 2021. Kahl said that the U.S. is far from ceasing its financial support for Ukraine. \"This package will certainly not be our last,\" Kahl added."},

In the second quarter of the year, e-commerce firm Alibaba posted its first ever flat year-on-year quarterly revenue growth and social media and gaming company Tencent reported its first sales decline on record. JD.com, China's second-largest e-commerce player, posted its slowest revenue growth in history, while electric vehicle maker Xpeng posted a wider-than-expected loss as well as weak guidance. Combined, these companies have a market capitalization of more than $770 billion. In the June quarter, China saw a resurgence of Covid cases. China has stuck to its so-called \"zero-Covid\" policy, a strict set of measures including lockdowns and mass testing to contain the virus. Major cities, including Shanghai, were locked down for several weeks. China's economy grew just 0.4% in the second quarter, and that impacted the strength of the consumer as well as spending from companies in areas like advertising and cloud computing. Those headwinds fed through to China's technology giants. \"Retail sales decreased year-over year in April and May due to the resurgence of Covid-19 in Shanghai and other major cities, and has slowly recovered in June,\" Daniel Zhang, CEO of Alibaba, said on the company's earnings call this month. Alibaba's logistics networks in China were also affected, and it said some of its cloud computing projects were delayed. Tencent, the owner of the WeChat messaging app and one of the world's biggest gaming firms, also felt the impact of the zero-Covid policy. Its fintech services revenue grew more slowly than in previous quarters as fewer people were going out and using its WeChat Pay mobile payments service. The company's online advertising revenue also fell sharply as companies tightened their budgets. JD.com fared well in the second quarter because it controls a lot of its logistics supply chain and inventory. However, it did see costs rise for fulfilment and logistics in the face of lockdowns. Electric carmaker XPeng said it expects to deliver between 29,000 and 31,000 vehicles in the third quarter. But that was weaker guidance than the market expected. As well as seasonal weakness, XPeng president Brian Gu said that \"traffic in the stores are less than what we've seen before because (of the) post-COVID situation.\" China's internet giants enjoyed a boom during the pandemic as people turned to online services such as shopping and gaming amid lockdowns. That has made year-on-year comparisons harder. Now, the Chinese economy is facing a number of headwinds this year that has made the macroeconomic environment even tougher. China's technology sector continues to contend with a much stricter regulatory environment. Over the past two years, China has introduced tougher policy in areas from gaming to data protection. With growth rates falling more sharply than in previous years, investors are cautious on their outlook. \"What I find interesting is how the narrative on the big tech companies ... has changed: early on in the pandemic, COVID was expected to benefit the big online platforms at the expense of 'offline' businesses, as much of the economy would be stuck at home with little other choice than to shop online and entertain themselves online,\" Tariq Dennison, wealth manager at GFM Asset Management, told CNBC via email. \"The recent revenue and earnings dip hitting these big tech names reflects zero COVID concerns short-term, but also has many long-term investors, including myself, revising our estimates of the long-term growth prospects of these names.\" Dennison said that Tencent, Alibaba and JD.com previously sustained more than 25% annual revenue growth and a long-term slowdown would be a concern. \"If this quarter is a sign of a permanent slowdown to single digit growth rates, rather than just a temporary dip, that of course would have a significant impact on long-term valuations of these shares,\" Dennison said."},

The defendants, Aimee Harris, 40, and Robert Kurlander, 58, conspired to steal items from Florida and transport them over state lines in September 2020, when Ashley's father was the Democratic nominee for the White House, according to a charging document. Kurlander as part of his plea in U.S. District Court in Manhattan agreed to cooperate with federal prosecutors, who are continuing to investigate how the diary was obtained by Project Veritas, the right-wing group that specializes in provocative videos and investigations designed to embarrass media outlets and other targets. Neither Biden was identified by name in the charging document released Thursday. But the details of the case match with what has been previously reported about an investigation by federal prosecutors in New York into the theft of Ashley's diary, which occurred weeks before the 2020 presidential election. The charging document says the father of the theft's victim was a \"then-former government official who was a candidate for national office.\" President Biden is a former U.S. senator and vice president. Ashley's diary, which she had left in a Delray Beach, Florida, home she was renting, and other items were ultimately sold for $40,000 to Project Veritas, which has offices in Mamaroneck, New York. Harris, who is a resident of Palm Beach, later temporarily stayed at the same residence where Ashley had lived, and discovered items that included a journal with \"highly personal entries\" and a digital storage card that the victim left behind, according to the charging document. The charging document says Project Veritas purchased the stolen property from Harris and the Jupiter resident Kurlander paid each of them $20,000. The charging document says that Harris asked Kurlander for his assistance in selling certain items of the victim's property. The document said that Harris and Kurlander in September 2020 attended a campaign fundraiser in Florida for a person, identified as Candidate-2, who was running against the victim's father. That fundraiser is understood to be one held for then-President Donald Trump. Four days later, a representative from Trump's campaign told Harris and Kurlander that the campaign was not interested in buying the stolen property, the charging document says. Kurlander then texted Harris, saying, \"[Candidate-2] campaign can't use it. They want it to go to the FBI. There is NO WAY [Candidate-2] can use this. It has to be done a different way.\" Manhattan U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in a statement Thursday, \"Harris and Kurlander stole personal property from an immediate family member of a candidate for national political office.\" \"They sold the property to an organization in New York for $40,000 and even returned to take more of the victim's property when asked to do so,\" Williams said. \"Harris and Kurlander sought to profit from their theft of another person's personal property, and they now stand convicted of a federal felony as a result,\" he said. Both defendants face a possible maximum sentence of five years in prison on the charge of conspiracy to commit interstate transportation of stolen property. They each agreed to forfeit $20,000 as part of their guilty pleas. FBI agents last November searched several locations that belonged to current and former members of Project Veritas as part of the probe of the Biden diary theft. Project Veritas CEO James O'Keefe, in a statement issued at that time, said that the organization had been approached by people offering it the Biden diary. But O'Keefe said the group decided not to publish the contents of the diary, and later turned it over to law enforcement when Ashley's lawyer refused to accept it. \"At the end of the day, we made the ethical decision that because, in part, we could not determine if the diary was real, if the diary in fact belonged to Ashley Biden, or if the contents of the diary occurred, we could not publish the diary and any part thereof,\" O'Keefe said at the time."},

The decision will affect flights by Xiamen, Air China, China Southern Airlines and China Eastern Airlines from Sept. 5 to Sept. 28. The U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) cited the recent cancellation of 26 American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines flights over Covid-19 cases. The suspensions include 19 China-bound flights from Los Angeles and 7 China Eastern flights from New York. The Chinese Embassy in Washington's spokesperson Liu Pengyu said the USDOT action was \"extremely irresponsible\" and \"groundlessly suspended Chinese airline flights.\" The embassy said China's Covid-19 \"circuit breaker\" measures were fair and transparent, applied both to Chinese and foreign airlines and were consistent with bilateral air transportation agreements. USDOT said as of Aug. 7 Chinese authorities had revised their policies so if the number of passengers on a flight to China testing positive for Covid-19 reached 4% of the total, one flight would be suspended. If it reached 8%, two flights would be suspended. USDOT said the U.S. has repeatedly raised objections with China, saying the rules place \"undue culpability on carriers\" when travelers test negative before boarding their flight from the United States only to \"test positive for Covid-19 after their arrival in China.\" Beijing and Washington have sparred over air services since the start of the pandemic. In January, the Transportation Department suspended 44 China-bound flights from the United States by the four Chinese carriers in response to China's decision suspend 44 flights by U.S. carriers. In August 2021, USDOT limited four flights from Chinese carriers to 40% passenger capacity for four weeks after Beijing imposed identical limits on four United Airlines flights. Three U.S. airlines and four Chinese carriers typically operate about 20 flights a week between the countries, well below the figure of more than 100 a week before the pandemic."},

The funds sent back to the SBA were obtained via the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program using both fabricated information and stolen identities. The suspects used Green Dot Bank, a fintech institution, to hold and move the fraudulent funds. More than 15,000 accounts were used in the conspiracy, by individuals in the U.S. as well as domestic and transnational organized crime rings, the agency said. Investigations are ongoing and further information about suspects was not immediately released. The investigation was initiated by the Secret Service field office in Orlando, Florida, and Green Dot bank worked with the agency to identify the fraudulent accounts. \"Fraudsters in general are always looking for ways and techniques to better do their crimes and modern conveniences are just one of those things they use. So currently, cryptocurrency is a big thing, fintechs, third-party payment systems. But there's not an institution, even our traditional financial institutions, that weren't targeted during the pandemic,\" Roy Dotson, lead investigator for the Secret Service, told CNBC in an interview. Initial investigations indicated the majority of the fraudulent accounts at Green Dot were established with synthetic and stolen identities, and involved using \"willing and unwilling money mules,\" Dotson said. The Secret Service and SBA Office of Inspector General put out advisories to 30,000 financial institutions in early 2020 to lay out fraud indicators and guide the banks to partner with federal agencies to recover fraudulent funds, Dotson said. He added these investigations will likely last years due to their size and scope. Green Dot said it has partnered with federal agencies including the Secret Service to identify fraud in the industry. \"Account protection and fraud prevention are top priorities for us, and we work around the clock and invest heavily to identify, block and address fraudulent activity. We're committed to protecting customers, and also to serving as [a] proactive ally to government agencies and industry peers as we work together to prevent fraud,\" Green Dot spokeswoman Alison Lubert said in a statement. OIG Inspector General Hannibal Ware said the partnership with the Secret Service has to date resulted in more than 400 indictments and nearly 300 convictions related to pandemic fraud. The U.S. government allocated more than $1 trillion to Main Street under both the Paycheck Protection Program and EIDL program. The PPP allowed small businesses to borrow loans that may be forgiven if the borrower used the majority of the capital on payroll, while the Covid-19 EIDL program allowed borrowers to access loans based on temporary losses of revenue due to the pandemic. An advance grant was also available under the EIDL. Reviews of the two programs by the SBA's Office of Inspector General warned that criminals would potentially exploit the system due to the fast-moving nature of the rollout and demand for aid. CNBC investigations revealed, in some cases, how easy it was for criminals to obtain fraudulent aid via stolen identities. The SBA OIG said it has identified $87 billion of potentially fraudulent EIDL loans. Over the past two years, the Secret Service said it has seized over $1.4 billion in fraudulently obtained funds and assisted in returning some $2.3 billion to state unemployment insurance programs. Nearly 4,000 pandemic-related fraud investigations and inquiries have been initiated by the Secret Service. More than 150 field offices and 40 cyber task forces are involved. \"This is not going to be a quick fix.

The DOJ's suggestions had been requested by a magistrate judge in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, who is considering requests from media outlets and others to unseal the affidavit, which led to the Aug. 8 raid on Trump's home at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach. The DOJ's proposal, which itself will remain under seal for now by court order, was expected to suggest extensive blacking out of portions of the affidavit because of the department's concern that full public disclosure of the document could put FBI agents or witnesses at risk, or undermine an ongoing criminal investigation. The DOJ is probing the removal of hundreds of pages of documents from the White House when Trump left office in January 2021. Presidential documents by law are required to be turned over to the National Archives and Records Administration. Court documents have revealed the DOJ is investigating possible violations of laws related to espionage and obstruction of justice. Affidavits filed in support of search warrant applications routinely include details of why the FBI and prosecutors believe a crime has likely been committed, and what evidence they expect or hope to find at the location that is the target of the warrant. During the raid on Mar-a-Lago, FBI agents seized about a dozen boxes of material. Court records indicate that the documents seized included material that was marked top secret. \"The United States has filed a submission under seal per the Court's order of Aug. 22,\" DOJ spokesman Anthony Coley said in a statement Thursday. \"The Justice Department respectfully declines further comment as the Court considers the matter,\" he said. Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart, who authorized the raid and is presiding over issues related to the warrant, has indicated he is likely to unseal at least portions of the affidavit. \"I cannot say at this point that partial redactions will be so extensive that they will result in a meaningless disclosure, but I may ultimately reach that conclusion after hearing further from the government,\" Reinhart wrote in an order Monday. Shortly after the proposal was filed, a group of media companies filed a motion asking the judge to unseal portions of the DOJ's legal brief arguing for the redactions. \"Like the search warrant affidavit itself, the Brief is a judicial record to which a presumption of public access applies,\" that motion by the media groups said. \"As this Court has already recognized, there is an 'intense public and historical interest in an unprecedented search of a former President's residence,' and the government bears the burden of demonstrating that 'a sufficiently important interest in secrecy\" justifies sealing,' \" the motion said. The media groups include NBCUniversal, the parent company of CNBC."},

The order Thursday came hours after the Department of Justice submitted a proposal in U.S District Court for the Southern District of Florida detailing how it wanted portions of that affidavit kept secret if the document were to be made public. That proposal itself is sealed, making it impossible to know what the DOJ wants to be kept hidden in the search warrant affidavit. But Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart in his order wrote that he agreed the DOJ \"has met its burden\" in showing there was a compelling reason to keep portions of the affidavit out of the public eye. Reinhart said the redactions were warranted because disclosure would reveal the identities of law enforcement agents, witnesses, and uncharged parties, as well as \"the investigation's strategy\" and direction, and \"grand jury information.\" FBI agents, carrying the warrant issued on the basis of the affidavit, on Aug. 8 raided Trump's residence at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach. They seized a dozen or so boxes of documents as part of a criminal investigation of the removal of presidential records from the White House when he left office in January 2021. Many of those documents were highly classified. The DOJ probe is eyeing possible obstruction of justice and violations of the U.S. espionage act and the law prohibiting the removal of official records. By law, presidential records must be given to the National Archives and Records Administration when a president leaves office. A group of media organizations had asked Reinhart to unseal the entire affidavit. That document, like other such affidavits submitted with search warrant applications, would detail why authorities believed there was probable cause that a crime had been committed. The affidavit also would describe what evidence authorities believed might be at the target location. But Reinhart, in his order Thursday, wrote, \"I further find that the Government has met its burden of showing that its proposed redactions are narrowly tailored to serve the Government's legitimate interest in the integrity of the ongoing investigation and are the least onerous alternative to sealing the entire Affidavit.\""},

Mark Kelly in November's election, according to people familiar with the matter. Masters has received urgent private calls in recent weeks from GOP leaders like Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., the head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, these people explained. The NRSC is the official campaign arm for the Senate GOP, and has spent over $6 million taking on Masters' rival Kelly, according to data from the nonpartisan OpenSecrets. Kelly's seat has long been considered a potential pickup opportunity for Republicans, as forecaster Cook Political Report labels the race a toss-up. Recent polling, however, suggests that Masters is falling behind. A Fox News poll taken in August shows Kelly leading Masters by 8 points, while an Arizona Republican pollster told NBC News that his own surveys showed Masters trailing Kelly by 10 points. Longtime GOP megadonors, who want to help Masters overtake Kelly but have not heard from him since he won the party's primary, have inundated the Republican candidate with calls, these people explained. A person familiar with one of the recent calls to Masters said a veteran GOP financier \"read him the riot act\" and told him, in part, that he must start raising money from more wealthy Republican donors and stop relying on billionaire tech executive Peter Thiel, his longtime colleague and friend, to help him like he did in the primary. These people declined to be named in order to speak freely about private conversations. Shortly after publication of this story, Katie Miller, a spokeswoman for the Masters campaign, denied that the candidate ever heard from a GOP megadonor who \"read him the riot act.\" Miller told CNBC in an email: \"It didn't happen.\" Kelly has massively outraised Masters, who won a Republican primary in Arizona this month. The incumbent's campaign has amassed more than $54 million during the 2022 election cycle, compared with just over $4 million for Masters' campaign, according to the latest Federal Election Commission data. Thiel contributed $15 million during the primary to a pro-Masters super PAC, Saving Arizona, and he donated $1.5 million to the committee as recently as July. Masters was the chief operating officer at Thiel Capital, an investment firm founded by Thiel. The calls to Masters come as even some Republican leaders seem to be questioning their Senate candidates. When asked about his predictions for the midterms, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said\"candidate quality\" has a lot to do with winning Senate elections. He added that he believes there will be an \"extremely close Senate\" after November's elections. The Senate is currently split 50-50 between Democrats and Republicans. In a statement to CNBC, NRSC spokesman Chris Hartline did not deny that Scott called Masters to urge him to improve his fundraising operation. \"Mark Kelly votes with Joe Biden almost 100% of the time. While he claims to be a moderate, he's supported reckless Washington spending and done nothing to address the border crisis that's raging in Arizona. The NRSC will continue to remind Arizona voters of Mark Kelly's radical agenda and Blake Masters' plans to fight for Arizona families,\" Hartline said in response to questions about Scott's contact with Masters. Data from ad tracker AdImpact shows that the NRSC has booked just over $3.8 million in ads in Arizona for September, but nothing yet for October or November. The ad tracker also shows that Masters' campaign has not yet booked airtime for the fall while Kelly's team has reserved over $10 million in ad space from September through November. AdImpact says it has not yet seen data showing the Thiel-backed Saving Arizona reserve airtime for the fall. The last spending it saw from the super PAC was on Aug. 2, the day of the Arizona Senate Republican primary. The super PAC spent over $10 million during the primary, including almost $8.5 million backing Masters, according to OpenSecrets. Masters and his campaign did not return requests for comment. A spokesman for Saving Arizona did not return requests for comment. Thiel and his spokesman did not return requests for comment, including about whether the billionaire GOP donor plans to help Masters further. The candidates and outside groups from both sides of the aisle have combined to spend over $90 million in the general election Senate race in Arizona. Yet Democratic organizations appear to be outspending their Republican rivals in the Grand Canyon State on ads in the coming months. AdImpact's data shows Democratic outside groups are reserving nearly $28 million worth of ad time in Arizona over the next three months. Republican committees have so far spent just over $16 million on ad buys within the same time span trying to help Masters overtake Kelly, according to the data."},

Biden will cancel up to $20,000 for recipients of Pell Grants. \"Both of these targeted actions are for families who need it the most,\" the president said in remarks from the White House on Wednesday afternoon. The relief will be limited to Americans earning under $125,000 per year, or $250,000 for married couples or heads of households. The relief is also capped at the amount of a borrower's outstanding eligible debt, per the Education Department. The president will also extend the payment pause on most federal student loans \"one final time\" through Dec. 31, 2022, according to the tweet. In his remarks, Biden said that 95% of borrowers would benefit from the plan, or about 43 million people. Of those, over 60% are Pell Grant recipients. In all, nearly 45% of borrowers, or almost 20 million people, would have their debt fully canceled, Biden said. \"That's 20 million people who can start getting on with their lives,\" Biden said. \"All of this means people can start finally to crawl out from under that mountain of debt. To get on top of their rent and their utilities. To finally think about buying a home or starting a family or starting a business.\" Biden's decision to move ahead with $10,000 in student debt cancellation for borrowers who earn under $125,000 will cost the federal government around $244 billion, according to higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. The $20,000 in relief for Pell Grant recipients may add around $120 billion to the government's costs. The unprecedented action by the White House of wiping out hundreds of billions of dollars in consumer debt follows years of advocacy pressure and recent months of heated debate among Biden administration officials. Those discussions centered on how student loan forgiveness might impact the high inflation hitting Americans' wallets, the amount of student debt that should be canceled and if the president even had the power to reduce people's balances without the legislative branch.

What to know\nHere's what President Biden's student loan forgiveness means for your taxes\nBiden's student loan forgiveness plan draws pushback from lawmakers and consumer groups\nBiden's student loan forgiveness will cost taxpayers, prompt inflation: Experts Looming November midterm elections added pressure on the administration to arrive at a decision. Advocates have said that forgiving student debt will galvanize younger voters, among whom Biden has been losing popularity, to the polls. Although the president had been pushed to cancel $50,000 or more per person, including by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and groups such as the NAACP, he had repeatedly expressed reluctance to wipe out that much debt for all borrowers. When the coronavirus pandemic hit the U.S. in March 2020 and crippled the economy, the Trump administration put federal student loan payments on pause. That pause has since been extended six times, and Biden's White House chief of staff, Ron Klain, said earlier this year that the president would make his decision on student loan forgiveness before payments resume in September. \"The student loan crisis\" has become a familiar term in the mouths of politicians and in households across the U.S. More than 40 million Americans are in debt for their education, owing a cumulative $1.7 trillion, a balance that far exceeds outstanding credit card or auto debt. Skyrocketing higher education costs coupled with stagnant wages have caused the amount of student debt people graduate with to soar. Today the average balance is over $30,000, up from $12,000 in 1980. Before the pandemic, when the U.S. economy was enjoying one of its healthiest periods in history, problems plagued the federal student loan system. Only about half of borrowers were in repayment in 2019, according to an estimate by Kantrowitz. A quarter \u2014 or more than 10 million people \u2014 were in delinquency or default, and the rest had applied for temporary relief for struggling borrowers, including deferments or forbearances. These grim figures led to comparisons to the 2008 mortgage crisis. \"The student loan system is broken,\" said Persis Yu, policy director for the Student Borrower Protection Center. Democrats and Republicans have pointed to major flaws in the federal student loan system. Problems come into play as soon as students take out loans, experts say, and more crop up in repayment. Among them: Research shows that student debt holds individuals back from starting businesses, saving for their retirement and buying homes. As a result, debt forgiveness is likely to change the life trajectory for tens of millions of Americans. Calls for broad student loan forgiveness date back to the Occupy Wall Street movement in 2011, shortly before outstanding education debt surpassed $1 trillion. At the time, advocates began to question why corporations should get a bailout from the government on their debt but not everyday Americans who had sought an education. In the 2020 Democratic primary, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., rolled out a plan to forgive $50,000 for almost all borrowers on her first day in office as president. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., went further, promising to cancel all of the debt if he made it to the White House. On the campaign trail, Biden took a more conservative approach than his rivals to the left, coming out in support of $10,000 in student loan forgiveness. In office, however, the president has been under relentless pressure from Democrats and advocates to deliver deeper relief. Wisdom Cole, national director of the NAACP's youth and college division, had said that nixing just $10,000 would be \"a slap in the face\" for Black borrowers, who often have to borrow more than their white peers because of the racial wealth gap. The announcement is sure to aggravate many Americans, including those who never borrowed for their education or went to college. Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, ranking member of the House Ways and Means Committee, recently called student loan forgiveness \" a giveaway to highly educated college grads.\" Some Republicans have said they will try to block an effort by the president to cancel the debt. Critics of student loan forgiveness have questioned the fairness of directing relief at those who have benefited from a college education, which usually leads to higher wages. \"Economists generally agree that widespread loan cancellation is regressive, delivering the biggest bailout to those who need it the least,\" said Beth Akers, a senior fellow at the center-right American Enterprise Institute. Forgiveness will only worsen the lending crisis, Akers added. \"The president is sending the wrong message to future borrowers who will likely expect their own bailout in the future,\" she said. \"Americans may borrow and pay more for college as a result.\" Yet advocates have said that framing student loan forgiveness as a handout to the well-off is a misinterpretation of the deep and historic inequities of the American economy. Mushrooming tuition prices coupled with stagnant household wages over the last 40 years, they argue, have forced more and more families to borrow to attend college, an increasingly necessary step to reach the middle class. \"All of these fat cats and people who never want to see help for working people and poor people come up with these myths,\" Schumer said in June, in one of his many pushes for $50,000 in student debt cancellation. \"This is not a problem that concerns the wealthy,\" Schumer said."},

Biden made one of the most influential policy decisions of his presidency Wednesday when he announced the cancellation of up to $10,000 in federal student loan debt for borrowers earning under $125,000 a year or $250,000 for married couples or heads of households. Pell Grant recipients can have up to $20,000 of debt canceled. The debt relief is capped at the amount of the borrower's outstanding debt, according to the Education Department. Some congressional Republicans immediately sought to undermine Biden's debt forgiveness plan. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., called it a \"radical agenda.\" \"Biden's debt transfer scam will make inflation even worse and does nothing to stop the runaway cost of college for most families,\" McCarthy posted on Twitter Wednesday. \"Americans cannot afford Democrats' radical agenda.\" Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene called the loan forgiveness policy \"unfair\" in an interview on conservative news network Newsmax TV. \"Taxpayers all over the country ... they shouldn't have to pay off the great, big student loan debt for some college student that piled up massive debt going to some Ivy League school,\" Greene said. The Georgia Republican added that Biden's debt forgiveness policy is a scheme to bring in Democratic votes during the November midterm elections. But public records show that Greene was the beneficiary of loan forgiveness in the early months of the pandemic. A Paycheck Protection Program loan of $182,200 given to Greene's company, Taylor Commercial Inc., in April 2020 was forgiven with accrued interest, according to records maintained by ProPublica. And wealthy Americans benefited from a nearly $2 trillion tax loophole after former President Donald Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act \u2014 passed by a Republican-controlled Congress \u2014 into law in 2017. Three-quarters of the benefit from the tax cuts outlined in the act would go to the top 1% of earners, per an analysis by the Tax Foundation. Biden's debt forgiveness policy is projected to cost the federal government around $244 billion, according to higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. Forgiveness for Pell Grant recipients will cost an additional $120 billion. The debt forgiveness plan also extends the pause on student loan debt repayments to Dec. 31, 2022. Over 40 million Americans owe $1.7 trillion in student loan debt."},

Marjorie Taylor Greene early Thursday morning, the second \"swatting\" call targeting the Republican congresswoman in two days, authorities confirmed. Two officers showed up to Greene's home in Rome, Georgia, after receiving a call at 2:53 a.m. ET Thursday about \"a male possibly shooting his family members and then himself,\" according to a report from the Rome Police Department. The suspect, who called through an internet chat that appeared to be a suicide crisis line, falsely told police responders that a man \"came out as trans-gender and claimed they shot the family\" at Greene's address, the report said. \"If anyone tried to stop me from shooting myself, I will shoot them,\" said the caller, who gave officers the name Wayne Greene and warned that \"they would be waiting for us,\" according to the police report. The officers went to Greene's house and met her at her front door, where they explained the situation, the report said. They \"confirmed this was a second false report,\" the department said in a press statement. Officers could not see a location used in the suicide chat line \"due to the person(s) using a VPN,\" the report said. The department said it is working with the U.S. Capitol Police on the investigation, which remains active. Greene revealed in a tweet Thursday morning that she was \"swatted again last night.\" Her spokesman, Nick Dyer, told CNBC he could confirm the incident. \"Our number one concern is the safety of Congresswoman Greene and her family,\" read a statement from Greene's office, which described the calls as \"violent crimes\" even though no violence occurred. The far-right lawmaker, who represents Georgia's 14th Congressional District and is supported by former President Donald Trump, was targeted in the first swatting call around 1 a.m. ET on Wednesday by an alleged opponent of her stance on transgender rights, police said. That caller falsely claimed that a man had been shot multiple times in a bathtub at Greene's residence. Afterward, the department received a second call from that suspect, who was using a computer-generated voice as they claimed responsibility for the incident. The suspect \"explained that they were upset about Ms. Greene's stance on 'trans-gender youth's rights', and stated that they were trying to 'SWAT' her,\" the police report said. Greene had introduced a bill in Congress last week that would make it a felony to provide gender-affirming care to transgender minors. The legislation came amid a growing right-wing movement against those treatments that recently targeted Boston Children's Hospital, which said last week that it is dealing with an influx of hostile calls and emails, including threats of violence. Greene later Thursday morning railed against media outlets that have criticized her politics on transgender issues. \"Those media companies, they're responsible for trying to get me killed by those horrific headlines,\" she said in an interview with Steve Bannon, a right-wing media host and former top Trump advisor. \"The disgusting left, MSNBCs and the NBCs, putting headlines up there that I'm targeting trans kids, that is the biggest lie, and I should sue them for saying such things,\" Greene said.

The previously unreported photo, released by the War College to Reuters after a request under the Freedom of Information Act, showed Mastriano in a 2013-14 portrait for the Department of Military Strategy, Plans, and Operations, where he worked. Faculty at the time had been given the option of dressing as a historical figure, people familiar with the photo said. At least 15 of the 21 faculty in the photo opted to appear in regular attire. Although one man wears a trench coat and sunglasses and another carries an aviator's helmet, Mastriano is the only one wearing a Confederate uniform. Mastriano did not immediately respond to requests for comment made by email and phone. A Reuters reporter attended a Mastriano event on Wednesday to seek comment, but the candidate did not make himself available for questions. Displays of Confederate symbols can be seen as insensitive to those who view them as painful reminders of racial oppression and the Civil War that saw 11 rebelling Confederate states fight to keep Black people enslaved. The U.S. military issued a de facto ban on displaying the Confederate flag and has sought to remove segregationist symbols from bases and academic institutions following the murder in May 2020 of George Floyd, a Black man whose killing by a white police officer in Minneapolis triggered protests worldwide. After Reuters made its formal request for the photo, it was removed from the War College wall where it had hung alongside other annual portraits of faculty groups. The Army War College (AWC), a premier military higher education institution in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, told Reuters a team had reviewed all art, text, and other images displayed at Carlisle Barracks in 2020, but missed the faculty photo. \"The faculty photo did not get the team's attention; the photo has since been removed because it does not meet AWC values,\" the college said in a statement. Asked about the War College photo, a spokesperson at U.S. Army headquarters said: \"The Army supports commanders who remove symbols or images that do not comport with Army values.\" Confederate symbols and dress have been embraced by white supremacists in the United States, and monuments and flags honoring the Confederacy have been removed from many public areas in recent years. Pennsylvania plays an outsized role in U.S. politics as a so-called swing state in presidential elections, and Republican Mastriano, who has embraced Trump's stolen election lies, is trailing his Democratic opponent in the governor's race ahead of the November ballot. It is unclear how the photo might be viewed in Pennsylvania, which played a critical role in the Civil War. More than 33,000 soldiers from Pennsylvania died fighting for the Union, and the state was the site of the Battle of Gettysburg, the conflict's bloodiest battle, which ended with a Union victory and inspired President Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. Mastriano's district, Pennsylvania's 33rd, includes Gettysburg. Many Americans continue to participate in Civil War battle re-enactments, wearing uniforms from both sides in an effort to preserve U.S. history."},

A few states quickly followed through. Idaho sold $300,000 of bonds in a Russian oil company in early March. A day before the invasion, the Kentucky Teachers Retirement System sold its shares in the Russian bank Sberbank. But those examples are outliers. Six months into a war that has killed thousands of Ukrainians and displaced over 12 million more, most of the pledges to drop Russian investments \u2014 some made with great fanfare during news conferences \u2014 have gone unfulfilled, according to an Associated Press review, state retirement administrators and firms that invest state funds. Swift global reaction has cut off much of Russia's economy from the rest of the world. That has made it nearly impossible for divestment by state pension funds, university endowments and other public-sector holdings \u2014 as well as private investments such as those in 401(k) accounts. \"These pension funds want to get out, but it's just not realistic to sell everything in the current environment,\" said Keith Brainard, research director at the National Association of State Retirement Administrators. Benjamin Smith, a spokesperson for the Rhode Island treasury, said the factors that make it hard to divest also show that a worldwide effort to isolate Russian President Vladimir Putin is working. \"This is good news because it means that pressure from investors across the world, including Rhode Island, is succeeding in exacting a toll on the Russian economy, making it more difficult for Putin to fund his military operation, state-owned companies, and corrupt network of oligarchs,\" he said in an email, noting that Rhode Island's pension plan exposure in Russia never exceeded 0.3% of its assets. Any pre-war investments in Russia are now worthless, or nearly so. That's raising questions from some officials and fund managers about whether divesting is even necessary. In Hawaii, one of a handful of states where top administration officials did not pledge to divest, Gov. David Ige said at a May 5 news conference that the state's employee pension system had \"very little to almost nothing\" invested in Russia. \"The few remaining investments are quite small, and so I didn't feel compelled to just make a statement for political reasons that we would be divesting,\" he said. Before Russia's invasion in late February, many government-controlled investments had only small holdings \u2014 a fraction of 1% in every reported case \u2014 in Russian investments. But even that could amount to millions of dollars. The largest U.S. public-sector retirement fund, California's CalPERS, said just 17 cents of every $100 of its portfolio was in Russian investments as the war broke out. Even so, that translated into $765 million worth of stocks, real estate and private equity. By the end of June, the value had shrunk to $194 million. The entire loss was because the holdings dropped in value; none had been sold. There is no way to know how much state government entities in the U.S. have invested in Russia or companies based there, but collectively they were worth billions of dollars before the war. Much of the money was invested in Russian government bonds, oil and coal companies as part of emerging-markets index funds. Quick to condemn the invasion, state officials said they could put pressure on Putin by dumping their Russian investments. \"Our moral imperative before these atrocities demand that you act to address Russia's aggressions and immediately restrict Russian access to California's capital and investments,\" California Gov. Gavin Newsom wrote in a letter on Feb. 28 to the boards overseeing the massive pension funds that serve teachers, state and local government workers and university employees. Across the country, governors and other top officials made similar statements. Just after the invasion began, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul signed an executive order calling for divestment \"to the extent possible,\" while Arizona's Board of Regents voted to exit any Russian investments. The treasurers for 36 states plus the District of Columbia and U.S. Virgin Islands signed a joint letter in March advocating divestment of publicly controlled funds from Russia. They noted a financial reason for doing so: \"The current crisis also constitutes a substantial risk for states' investments and our economic security.\" A major chunk of the government holdings in Russia is in the form of index funds that investors use to mimic overall stock market performance. Russian stocks were commonly part of funds specializing in emerging markets. MCSI and other firms that decide which stocks should be in the funds quickly dropped Russian securities. But the companies that sell investment products based on those indexes were left in the lurch, still leaving pieces of Russian stocks in their investors' portfolios. As part of the sanctions, stock markets in the U.S. and elsewhere stopped the trading of Russian stocks. And the Moscow Stock Exchange was closed for nearly a month, reopening with tight controls that keep U.S. investors from selling. The assets sank in value amid the invasion, though the precise value isn't always clear. Maryland said that as of the beginning of February, $197 million of its state retirement and pension system funds were invested in Russian assets. A month later, the state estimated the value had plunged and amounted to just $32 million. The state has been unable to unload its investments. For the handful of states in which top officials have not endorsed divestment, eroding values like that are the main reason. Shortly after the invasion, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said the number of state investments in Russia was \"minuscule\" and noted that the value was about to \"shrink to almost nothing as the Russian economy is being virtually shut off from the world.\" In Florida, Lamar Taylor, the interim executive director of the agency that oversees investments of pension funds, said during a cabinet meeting that some investment managers might seek to unload Russian assets as soon as they're able, while others could hold on in case they're worth more later. At the meeting, Gov. Ron DeSantis said the State Board of Administration has a legal responsibility to try to make money for the retirement system. \"That would violate your fiduciary duty, if you liquidated at massive losses for political reasons rather than for the best interests of the beneficiaries,\" he said. But DeSantis said there was a way to make it easier: Lawmakers passing a bill banning investment in Russia. \"If the Legislature could speak clearly, that would be something we'd welcome here, just to make sure we're not furthering investments in parts of the world that are not reflective of our interests or values,\" he said. Hank Kim, executive director of the National Conference on Public Employee Retirement Systems, said he has told member pension funds that taking steps to divest is important even if it can't be completed right away. \"The public has a right to know that it was debated in a serious manner,\" he said."},

Ron DeSantis in Florida ", "tag": "Politics", "author": "Kevin Breuninger", "datetime": "2022-08-31 16:22:20", "paragraphs": " Democratic Rep. Charlie Crist announced Wednesday he will resign from Congress as he campaigns to unseat Florida's Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in November. The move will shrink Democrats' already-slim majority in the House, potentially complicating efforts to pass more legislation before the midterm elections when Republicans are currently favored to take control. Serving in Congress \"has been an honor and a privilege,\" Crist said in a statement, which did not mention his campaign for governor. \"From the bottom of my heart, thank you for trusting me as your Representative in Washington.\" Crist will step down by the close of business Wednesday, he said in the statement. Congressional staff for Crist's district will provide casework and constituent services until the next representatives are sworn in in January, the statement said. Florida's 13th Congressional District, where Crist has served since 2017, is considered a likely pickup for Republicans this November, according to the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. The district's political makeup shifted toward the GOP after a new congressional map, proposed by DeSantis, re-shaped the area. Crist handily won the Democratic nomination for Florida's gubernatorial race. But polls show him trailing DeSantis, a dominant figure in the GOP who is widely rumored to be gearing up for a 2024 presidential run. DeSantis has also far outraised Crist: The powerful Republican incumbent governor's campaign has raised more than $165 million since 2019, OpenSecrets reported earlier this month. DeSantis' stature in the party is exceeded perhaps only by former President Donald Trump, who has regularly teased the possibility of launching another White House bid. Crist's move mirrors DeSantis' decision in 2018 to resign from Congress as he campaigned for governor in a hotly contested race against Democrat Andrew Gillum. DeSantis at the time said that he did not want to be criticized for taking a U.S. representative's paycheck while missing votes."},

The two-page order from U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon signals that she's inclined to grant a request from Trump's lawyers, who this week asked for the appointment of an independent special master to review the records taken from Mar-a-Lago and identify any that may be protected by executive privilege. The judge scheduled a Thursday hearing to discuss the matter further. A special master is often a former judge. Cannon also directed the Justice Department to file under seal with her more detailed descriptions of the material taken from Trump's property. The former president's lawyers have complained that investigators did not disclose enough information to them about what specific documents were removed when agents executed a search warrant on Aug. 8 to look for classified documents.

The narrowly focused filing in U.S. District Court in West Palm Beach came one day after the Department of Justice argued that appointing a special master could harm the government's national security interests. The DOJ's filing also said that \"efforts were likely taken to obstruct the government's investigation\" into the records that had been shipped to Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence after the end of his presidency. And the DOJ revealed that the FBI seized more than 100 classified documents from the Palm Beach resort during its search of the premises earlier this month. The agency also shared a redacted FBI photo showing documents with classification markings that had been recovered from a container in Trump's \"45 Office.\" Trump's legal team in its Wednesday night reply accused the DOJ of twisting \"the framework of responding to a motion for a Special Master into an all-encompassing challenge to any judicial consideration, presently or in the future, of any aspect of its unprecedented behavior in this investigation.\" The government's \"extraordinary document\" suggests \"that the DOJ, and the DOJ alone, should be entrusted with the responsibility of evaluating its unjustified pursuit of criminalizing a former President's possession of personal and Presidential records in a secure setting,\" Trump's lawyers wrote. They also accused the DOJ of providing multiple \"misleading or incomplete statement[s] of purported 'fact,'\" but offered few specifics. Judge Aileen Cannon, who was appointed by Trump, has set a hearing for Thursday at 1 p.m. ET in a West Palm Beach courthouse. Trump had sued to block the Justice Department from further investigating any materials taken in the Mar-a-Lago raid until a special master is able to analyze them. That step is typically taken when there is a chance that some evidence should be withheld from prosecutors because of various legal privileges. The DOJ told the judge on Monday that its review of the seized materials was complete, and that a law enforcement team had identified a \"limited set\" of materials that may be protected by attorney-client privilege. That privilege often refers to the legal doctrine that protects the confidentiality of communications between an attorney and their client. Trump's lawyers responded Wednesday that the so-called privilege review team was \"wholly deficient\" in identifying and separating all potentially privileged documents from the rest of the seized materials. Trump and his office have publicly claimed that he declassified all the documents that had been seized by the FBI. But Trump's legal team has not made that explicit argument in the civil lawsuit before Cannon. The DOJ in Tuesday's late-night filing said that when 15 boxes were retrieved from Mar-a-Lago by the National Archives in January, Trump \"never asserted executive privilege over any of the documents nor claimed that any of the documents in the boxes containing classification markings had been declassified.\" The government also said that no claims about declassification were made when FBI agents went to Mar-a-Lago on June 3, pursuant to a grand jury subpoena to collect any more records in Trump's possession that bore classification markings. The DOJ said it obtained that subpoena in May, after the FBI developed evidence that dozens of boxes with classified information \u2014 beyond the 15 boxes retrieved in January \u2014 were still at Trump's residence. \"When producing the documents, neither counsel nor the custodian asserted that the former President had declassified the documents or asserted any claim of executive privilege. Instead, counsel handled them in a manner that suggested counsel believed that the documents were classified: the production included a single Redweld envelope, double-wrapped in tape, containing the documents,\" the DOJ wrote. At the same time, Trump's custodian of records had also provided a sworn certification letter, claiming that \"any and all\" documents responsive to a grand jury subpoena had been handed over, the DOJ wrote. But the FBI later \"uncovered multiple sources of evidence\" indicating that more classified documents remained at Mar-a-Lago, according to the DOJ's filing. \"The government also developed evidence that government records were likely concealed and removed from the Storage Room and that efforts were likely taken to obstruct the government's investigation,\" the DOJ wrote. That and other information led the government to seek a warrant to search Mar-a-Lago, which was ultimately carried out Aug. 8. In their reply on Wednesday, Trump's lawyers wrote that the DOJ's account of the June 3 meeting \"has been significantly mischaracterized.\" \"If the Government provided the same untrue account in the affidavit in support of the search warrant, then they misled the Magistrate Judge,\" the former president's lawyers wrote. Trump, in a social media post earlier Wednesday evening, also accused the DOJ of being \"very deceiving\" by sharing a photo that appears to show numerous classified papers strewn about on a carpeted floor. Trump clarified that the FBI \"took them out of cartons and spread them around on the carpet, making it look like a big 'find' for them.\" \"They dropped them, not me - Very deceiving...And remember, we could have NO representative, including lawyers, present during the Raid. They were told to wait outside,\" Trump wrote."},

The former TV personality's vocal support for the energy business follows years of industry donations to his nonprofit and then his campaign, according to financial records reviewed by CNBC. Oz also has a personal stake in oil and gas through investments in two major energy companies, according to his financial disclosures. Pennsylvania's next senator will be a key vote for the energy industry, as it has a major presence in the Keystone State. Pennsylvania is the nation's second-largest natural gas producer after Texas and the third-largest coal producer, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Oz backed the energy industry this year as Americans felt the strain from spiking gas prices. In a recent interview, he ripped President Joe Biden after he called on companies that run gas stations to bring down prices at the pump. \"Now, they're blaming the energy companies for the gas prices. And I'm thinking, like most Americans, what are you talking about? I mean, you did things that make it, make it impossible for these companies to exist,\" Oz said in a July interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity. He called Biden's comments \"class warfare.\" As Oz champions oil and gas in his bid to represent Pennsylvania in the Senate, both his campaign and personal coffers have benefited from the industry and its executives. Oz, a veteran physician and television host, is running against Democrat John Fetterman for a Senate seat being vacated by Republican Sen. Pat Toomey. Oz is trailing Fetterman by just under 8 percentage points in an average of recent polls, according to RealClearPolitics. Fetterman's campaign has raised over $25 million, while Oz and his team have brought in just over $18 million, according to data from the nonpartisan OpenSecrets. Oz and his wife, Lisa, have a financial stake in the industry he has championed, as they own shares of oil and gas giants ConocoPhillips and Pioneer Natural Resources, according to their financial disclosure report. The filing notes they own shares of ConocoPhillips valued between $15,001 and $50,000 and Pioneer stock valued between $1,001 and $15,000. Oz's connections to the industry formed before he pursued politics. His nonprofit HealthCorps, which promotes itself as a group aiming to help teens with their health and wellness, has seen at least $210,000 in contributions from gas and oil producer Continental Resources since 2016, according to the group's annual financial reports. Continental's support has continued into Oz's Senate bid: The company's founder and chair, Harold Hamm, endorsed Oz for Senate in an April campaign video. The backing from energy industry leaders has led to contributions to Oz's campaign. Hamm is among a group of over a dozen oil and gas industry leaders who have combined to contribute over $200,000 to Oz's campaign since he announced his run for Senate late last year, according to a CNBC review of Federal Election Commission filings. Others with ties to the oil and gas business who have donated at least $2,900 to Oz's campaign include Jimmy Haslam, an owner of the Cleveland Browns and chair of Pilot Company, a business that owns fueling stations across the country. His father and Pilot founder, James Haslam II, also donated to the Oz campaign. Other top energy donors in recent months include Brad Cox, the chair of oil producer Cox Operating, and Janet Cafaro, the president of Silcor Oilfield Services, FEC records show. Jimmy Haslam and his wife, Susan \"Dee\" Haslam, combined to give $50,000 to the pro-Oz super PAC American Leadership Action. Jimmy and Dee Haslam told CNBC in a statement that they have \"tremendous respect for the long, successful career Dr. Oz has had in the private sector and appreciate that he now wants to serve his country by bringing his expertise and experience to the United States Senate.\" The Haslam family, as of 2015, had a net worth of $6 billion, according to Forbes. Representatives for Cox and Cafaro did not return requests for comment. Hamm told CNBC in a statement that he considers Oz a \"friend.\" He said the two have known each other for almost a decade, with the goal of bringing HealthCorps' services into Oklahoma schools. Hamm explained that he believes Oz will be a key advocate for the energy sector, which has enriched the oil billionaire. He and his family have a net worth of at least $21 billion, according to Forbes. \"Dr. Oz will champion American energy in the U.S. Senate much like he's championed health his entire career,\" Hamm said. The nonprofit's annual reports from 2016 through 2020 give a range of how much donors contributed to HealthCorps. Continental Resources regularly ranked among the Oz group's top backers. The company is often listed as donating between $50,000 and $99,999 during those years. A HealthCorps filing says it received a range of $10,000 to just under $25,000 from Continental in 2018. In its earlier filings before 2016, HealthCorps lists Continental as either a \"national\" or a \"community\" sponsor. The group's website notes that its national sponsors contribute $1 million and its community donors write checks for $250,000. The disclosures pre-2016 do not say or show a range of how much the company gave those years. Oz's support from the massive energy industry coincides with an apparent shift in his opinion on fracking, which allows companies to drill deep into the earth for oil and gas resources. Critics say that fracking hurts the environment by harming water supplies and polluting the air. Before Oz ran for Senate, he repeatedly wrote columns that took aim at fracking, noting its potential threat to public health, Vice reports. \"And in Pennsylvania, there are multiple reports of air and water contamination, possibly from hydraulic fracturing sites, causing folks breathing problems, rashes, headaches, nosebleeds, numbness, nausea and vomiting,\" Oz said in a 2014 column critical of fracking. Brittany Yanick, a spokeswoman for the Oz campaign, said the candidate has not changed his view on fracking and is a strong supporter of the drilling method. She also took aim at Fetterman's position on the issue. \"As a scientist, Dr. Oz understands that, like with COVID, the Biden administration is ignoring the science and the benefits of natural gas in order to satisfy the radical Left, the same liberal Democrats that are supporting radical environmental measures and funding John Fetterman's campaign,\" Yanick said in an emailed statement. \"John Fetterman has called fracking a 'stain' on Pennsylvania, he's called for a moratorium on fracking, and he would be a rubber stamp for the failing Biden Agenda.\" Fetterman has a mixed history with where he stands on fracking. Inside Climate News reported that Fetterman dropped his support for a fracking moratorium after his failed 2016 primary run for Senate. His position evolved after the state moved toward stricter regulations on fracking. Emilia Rowland, a spokeswoman for Fetterman's campaign, told CNBC that \"John does not support a ban on fracking in Pennsylvania and that includes a moratorium on new fracking sites.\" She said he hasn't taken any campaign money from the fossil fuel industry. \"John believes fully heartedly that we have to preserve the union way of life for the thousands of workers currently employed by the natural gas industry in Pennsylvania and the communities where they live. We can't just abandon these people, and tell them to go learn how to code,\" Rowland said in a statement. \"It's a total false choice that we have to choose between jobs and a clean environment. That's just not true. We can have both.\" Still, Oz appears more vocal than Fetterman in publicly supporting the oil and gas industry. In a recent op-ed, he said it's \"gross, and deeply unpatriotic\" for oil companies to charge high gas prices while their businesses are making massive profits. Fetterman namechecked Chevron, Exxon and Shell in the op-ed. Oz has rubbed elbows with industry officials during his campaign. He was invited to a June \"energy industry meet and greet\" by longtime lobbyist Missy Edwards. The invite says the meeting was set to take place at Edwards' offices in Washington. Her current clients include Southern Company and General Motors, OpenSecrets says. A spokeswoman for General Motors said she was \"not sure if GM had a representative in attendance.\" Edwards and a representative for Southern Company did not return requests for comment."},

The FBI had probable cause to believe that records containing classified national defense information would be found at the Palm Beach, Florida, residence, according to an agent who wrote the 32-page affidavit. \"There is also probable cause to believe that evidence of obstruction will be found\" at Trump's home, read an unredacted portion of the affidavit. A federal judge had ordered the key document's release over the objections of the DOJ, which argued it contains highly sensitive facts about the ongoing criminal investigation into Trump. U.S. Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart accepted the DOJ's proposed redactions to the affidavit one day before it was made public. Click here or scroll down to read the heavily redacted affidavit. \"The government is conducting a criminal investigation concerning the improper removal and storage of classified information in unauthorized spaces, as well as the unlawful concealment and removal of government records,\" the FBI agent, whose name was blacked out, wrote in the affidavit's first line. The agent then wrote that the probe began because of a referral from the National Archives and Records Administration in February, after NARA received 15 boxes of records from Trump's residence in Florida. By law, presidential records must be turned over to the National Archives when a president departs office. The FBI found that in those boxes were documents that bore classification markings, and included records relating to national defense information, which had been stored at Mar-a-Lago in an unsecured location. The 15 boxes included 184 specific documents marked classified, 67 of which were marked \"confidential,\" 92 marked \"secret\" and 25 documents marked \"top secret,\" according to the affidavit. \"Based upon this investigation, I do not believe that any spaces within the PREMISES have been authorized for the storage of classified information at least since the end of FPOTUS 's Presidential Administration on January 20, 2021,\" the agent wrote in the affidavit. Of the 32 pages of the affidavit, 21 pages are almost totally or significantly blacked out. The search warrant itself was revealed voluntarily by the DOJ less than a week after the Aug. 8 raid. The warrant indicated that FBI agents were looking for materials showing violations of laws against obstruction of justice and the removal of official records, as well as the U.S. Espionage Act. The FBI took at least 20 boxes of items in the August raid, including numerous sets of highly classified documents, according to a property receipt that was also made public by the DOJ. In a social media post after the redacted affidavit was released, Trump accused the FBI and DOJ of \"public relations subterfuge\" by the fact that the word \"Nuclear\" did not appear in the document \u2014 though he also noted that it was \"heavily redacted!!!\" The affidavit did not detail the specific content of documents it expected to find. Trump also lashed out at Reinhart, arguing that he should have recused himself from this matter because he had previously removed himself from another case involving the former president. The reason for that recusal was not clear, news outlets reported, but Trump claimed it was \"based on his animosity and hatred of your favorite President, me.\" The government argued last week against releasing the affidavit, even in a redacted form. \"The redactions necessary to mitigate harms to the integrity of the investigation would be so extensive as to render the remaining unsealed text devoid of meaningful content,\" read a court filing from Jay Bratt, head of the counterintelligence and export control section of the DOJ's National Security Division. Bratt also argued that the affidavit \"would serve as a roadmap to the government's ongoing investigation\" if disclosed. Reinhart disagreed, and ordered the government to propose redactions to U.S. District Court in West Palm Beach, Florida, by Thursday. The judge accepted the DOJ's redactions later that day. The government said last week that the Mar-a-Lago raid is part of a probe that \"implicates national security\" and is still in its \"early stages.\" Trump, who first revealed the FBI's search of his Florida residence, has cast himself as the victim of a political attack by the Biden administration that was carried out against the presumptive Republican front-runner in the 2024 presidential race. The former president on Monday sued the government, asking a federal judge to block the DOJ from poring over the documents seized from Mar-a-Lago until a court-appointed third party reviews them. \"The political Hacks and Thugs had no right under the Presidential Records Act to storm Mar-a-Lago and steal everything in sight, including Passports and privileged documents,\" Trump said in a social media post earlier Friday morning.

John Eastman also invoked protections under attorney-client privilege in refusing to answer at least some questions he was asked before the grand jury, which was convened as part of a criminal probe into the possibility of illegal interference in Georgia's presidential election contest, his attorneys said. Eastman is one of a group of Trump allies who were subpoenaed by that panel, which is hearing testimony in Atlanta. A second ally, Trump's former personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, has been named a target in that investigation and recently testified before the same grand jury. Eastman wrote a series of memos after the 2020 election calling on then-Vice President Mike Pence to effectively undo President Joe Biden 's win by refusing to certify the Electoral College results. \"In his appearance before the Fulton County Special Grand Jury, we advised our client John Eastman to assert attorney-client privilege and the constitutional right to remain silent where appropriate,\" Eastman's lawyers, Charles Burnham and Harvey Silverglate, said in a statement. \"Out of respect for grand jury secrecy we will not disclose the substance of the questions or testimony. We wish to thank the grand jurors for their service,\" the attorneys said. The statement also blasted Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis for the probe itself. \"By all indications, the District Attorney's Office has set itself on an unprecedented path of criminalizing controversial or disfavored legal theories, possibly in hopes that the federal government will follow its lead,\" the lawyers said. \"Criminalization of unpopular legal theories is against every American tradition and would have ended the careers of John Adams, Ruth Ginsburg, Thurgood Marshall and many other now-celebrated American lawyers,\" the statement said. Adams was the second president of the United States, while Ginsburg and Marshall were Supreme Court justices who helped establish new legal precedents with their work during the civil rights movement. \"We ask all interested observers of any political persuasion to join us in decrying this troubling development,\" Burnham and Silverglate wrote. Eastman last month revealed that his cellphone was seized by federal agents who stopped him in New Mexico and forced him to unlock it. That seizure was done as part of an investigation by the Justice Department's internal watchdog, the Office of the Inspector General. The IG's office is probing the role of the Justice Department and its components in \"preparing for and responding to\" the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters, according to the office's website. That riot occurred as a joint session of Congress was convened to certify Biden's victory, with Pence presiding over the proceedings. A former Justice Department official, Jeffrey Clark, had electronics seized from his Virginia home on the same day that Eastman's phone was seized. Clark also backed Trump's effort to overturn the election. Trump considered installing Clark as attorney general in the days leading up to Jan. 6, 2021, but dropped the idea after a group of top Justice officials said they would resign in protest if that happened."},

Schiff and Maloney said in a joint statement they were pleased the government was \"assessing the damage caused by the improper storage of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago.\" Politico reported the letter earlier. The Justice Department on Friday disclosed that it was investigating Trump for removing White House records because it believed he illegally held documents including some involving intelligence-gathering and clandestine human sources \u2014 among America's most closely held secrets. Haines said DNI \"will also lead an Intelligence Community (IC) assessment of the potential risk to national security that would result from the disclosure of the relevant documents\" including those seized. The Justice Department on Friday released a heavily redacted affidavit that underpinned the FBI's extraordinary search of Mar-a-Lago in which agents seized 11 sets of classified records including some labeled \"top secret\" as documents that could gravely threaten national security if exposed. In the affidavit, an unidentified FBI agent said the agency reviewed and identified 184 documents \"bearing classification markings\" containing \"national defense information\" after Trump in January returned 15 boxes of government records sought by the U.S. National Archives. Other records in those boxes, according to the affidavit, bore handwritten notes by Trump. Schiff and Maloney said the Justice Department release Friday \"affirms our grave concern that among the documents stored at Mar-a-Lago were those that could endanger human sources. It is critical that the IC move swiftly to assess and, if necessary, to mitigate the damage done.\" The search was part of a federal investigation into whether Trump illegally removed and kept documents when he left office in January 2021 after losing the 2020 election to President Joe Biden and whether Trump tried to obstruct the probe. Trump, a Republican who is considering another presidential run in 2024, has described the court-approved search at the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach as politically motivated, and on Friday again described it as a \"break-in.\""},

Pitney Bowes, which provides logistic services for retailers including eBay and American Eagle, will integrate Gatik's self-driving box trucks starting in 2023. The trucks will supplement five existing routes in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and will run packages between distribution centers, so-called \"middle-mile\" delivery. The partnership gives the global logistics company access to some of the first commercial autonomous delivery trucks on the market and adds to Gatik's growing footprint in the U.S. short-haul delivery market. Gatik, which was founded in Silicon Valley in 2017, aims to automate shorter, business-to-business hauls with fixed, repeatable routes. It launched a partnership with Walmart in 2021, becoming the first commercial delivery company to go completely driverless. While some autonomous driving systems, such as Tesla's, have faced heightened scrutiny, Gatik says it's navigated the difficult environment by limiting its focus on middle-mile routes. \"By constraining the autonomy problem, we can get to the point where the driver comes out [of the safety driver role] faster than anyone else in the industry,\" Gatik's CEO, Gautam Narang, told CNBC in an interview. \"We chose the safest possible routes and the easiest possible routes.\" Gatik's routes do not cross state lines, and they are optimized with the help of regulators to avoid schools, hospitals and unprotected left turns. The trucks used are also smaller than many the trucks of its competitors. The Pitney Bowes routes will have a safety driver to start, but the company expects to have the trucks completely driverless within a few months. At scale, Gatik estimates it could provide up to 30% cost savings for Pitney Bowes. Pitney Bowes has begun a national rollout of automation technology in its warehouses, and pending the pilot program's success, a broader rollout of Gatik's automated delivery routes could follow.

The \"limited set\" of potentially privileged information was identified by a team that is kept separate from the investigative squad that searched Trump's Palm Beach, Florida, residence earlier this month, DOJ officials said in a court filing in U.S. District Court in southern Florida on Monday morning. The so-called privilege review team \"completed its review of those materials\" and is following a process to \"address potential privilege disputes, if any,\" according to that filing. Attorney-client privilege often refers to the legal doctrine that protects the confidentiality of communications between an attorney and their client. The DOJ's filing provided no details about the potentially privileged materials. The agency disclosed the privilege team's review one week after Trump sued to block the DOJ from further investigating any materials taken in the raid until a court-appointed \"special master\" is able to analyze them. Judge Aileen Cannon, who was appointed by Trump, gave notice Saturday of her \"preliminary intent to appoint a special master\" in the case. Cannon ordered the government to publicly respond to Trump by Tuesday. She also ordered the DOJ to submit a sealed filing that provides more details about the seized materials, and she set a hearing for Thursday at 1 p.m. ET in a West Palm Beach courthouse. In response, top DOJ counterintelligence official Jay Bratt assured the judge that the government will comply with those orders. But \"the government notes that, before the Court issued its Preliminary Order, and in accordance with the judicially authorized search warrant's provisions, the Privilege Review Team ... identified a limited set of materials that potentially contain attorney-client privileged information\" and \"completed its review of those materials,\" Bratt wrote. The DOJ and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, or ODNI, \"are currently facilitating a classification review of materials recovered\" from Trump's residence, Bratt added. The ODNI \"is also leading an intelligence community assessment of the potential risk to national security that would result from the disclosure of these materials,\" he wrote. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre declined to answer reporters' specific questions about the DOJ probe later Monday, stressing that the agency is conducting its investigation independently and \"we have not been involved.\" She noted, however, neither President Joe Biden nor anyone else at the White House has been briefed on the matter, but declined to comment on any classified materials prepared for the president. Trump's civil lawsuit is being overseen by a different judge than the one who approved the search warrant for Mar-a-Lago. The affidavit for that search warrant \u2014 in which an FBI agent explained why the government had probable cause to believe the search would turn up evidence of illegality \u2014 was released Friday, albeit with heavy redactions. The National Archives and Records Administration retrieved 15 boxes of records from Mar-a-Lago in January. The next month, NARA sent a referral to the DOJ that the records contained \"highly classified documents intermingled with other records,\" according to the affidavit. By law, presidential records must be turned over to the National Archives when a president departs office. The FBI launched a criminal investigation and found that the 15 boxes included 184 specific documents marked classified, 67 of which were marked \"confidential,\" 92 marked \"secret\" and 25 marked \"top secret,\" according to the affidavit. The search warrant was revealed days after the FBI entered Mar-a-Lago in August. It indicated that FBI agents were looking for materials showing violations of laws against obstruction of justice and the removal of official records, as well as the U.S. Espionage Act. The FBI took at least 20 boxes of items in the August raid, including numerous sets of highly classified documents, according to a property receipt that was also made public by the DOJ."},

Bosch plans to expand an existing factory in Anderson, South Carolina, to build the fuel cell \"stacks\" starting in 2026. The investment is expected to create at least 350 new jobs at the factory, the company said. Bosch's North America president, Mike Mansuetti, said the company decided to invest in U.S. production to support \"growing demand\" from its automotive customers in North America. \"As our success in acquiring e-mobility business here in the region continues, it's critical that we have local production capabilities to support our local customers,\" Mansuetti said in a statement. Fuel cells chemically convert the energy in hydrogen gas to electricity, emitting only water. While expensive to build, the devices are finding applications in large electric vehicles that would otherwise require excessively large and heavy battery packs, such as semitrucks, construction equipment and military vehicles. The fuel cells built by Bosch in South Carolina will be used to power electric heavy trucks, including forthcoming models from Arizona-based EV truck startup Nikola, the company said. Nikola has begun pilot testing of a fuel cell-powered version of its Tre electric semitruck, with about 500 miles of range. The company expects to begin production of the fuel cell-powered Tre by the end of next year, and to launch a second fuel cell truck with 900 miles of range in 2024."},

Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and FBI agents along with NYPD detectives were seen carrying boxes during a search of 19 Duck Pond Lane in Southampton, N.Y., and the search of 515 Park Ave. in Manhattan. Records show those properties are linked to sanctioned Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg, a billionaire and close ally of President Vladimir Putin who heads the Moscow-based Renova Group, a conglomerate with interests in the metals, mining, and tech industries, according to U.S. Treasury Department documents. A search is also underway at a property on Miami's Fisher Island that authorities say was linked to Vekselberg, according to sources familiar with the matter. The U.S. seizure of Vekselberg's $900 million superyacht off the coast of Italy in early April marked the first under newly imposed Western sanctions targeting assets of Russian elites in response to the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine. Vekselberg is one of numerous Russian oligarchs to face sanctions since the start of the war. In addition to sanctions, Vekselberg has been the subject of a U.S. Department of Justice investigation into allegations of bank fraud. No charges have been filed in that case. All of Vekselberg's assets in the U.S. are frozen and American companies are barred from doing business with him and his entities. The Ukrainian-born businessman built his fortune by investing in the aluminum and oil industries in the post-Soviet era. Vekselberg has long had ties to the U.S., including a green card he once held and homes in New York and Connecticut. He was also questioned in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. A call to an attorney associated with the Hamptons property was not immediately returned Thursday. Attempts to reach a representative for Vekselberg were not immediately successful. HSI and FBI confirmed their agents were at those locations but declined further comment. The U.S. Department of Justice and NYPD declined immediate comment."},

The Justice Department argued in a court filing that Trump lacks the legal standing to appoint a special master. Appointing that watchdog could harm national security, the agency warned. The department also said it has evidence that government records likely were concealed and removed from a storage room at Trump's home at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, \"and that efforts were likely taken to obstruct the government's investigation.\" Trump had sued to block the Justice Department from further investigating any materials taken in the raid until a court-appointed special master is able to analyze them. That step is typically taken when there is a chance that some evidence should be withheld from prosecutors because of various legal privileges. \"As an initial matter, the former President lacks standing to seek judicial relief or oversight as to Presidential records because those records do not belong to him,\" the DOJ wrote to Judge Aileen Cannon in U.S. District Court in southern Florida. Cannon, who was appointed by Trump, has set a hearing for Thursday at 1 p.m. ET in a West Palm Beach courthouse. Trump's legal team has until Wednesday night to reply to the DOJ's latest submission. The DOJ is conducting a criminal investigation of the removal of White House documents and their shipment to Trump's residence at Mar-a-Lago when he left office. By law, presidential records must be turned over to the National Archives and Records Administration when a president departs office. The National Archives and Records Administration retrieved 15 boxes of records from Mar-a-Lago in January. The next month, NARA sent a referral to the DOJ that the records contained \"highly classified documents intermingled with other records,\" according to the affidavit used to obtain the warrant for the Aug. 8 search of Trump's home. The DOJ said in Tuesday night's filing that the FBI had \"uncovered multiple sources of evidence indicating ... that classified documents remained\" at Mar-a-Lago. \"The government also developed evidence that government records were likely concealed and removed from the Storage Room and that efforts were likely taken to obstruct the government's investigation,\" the DOJ wrote. That evidence contradicted a sworn certification letter on June 3 from the custodian of Trump's records, claiming that \"any and all\" documents responsive to a grand jury subpoena had been handed over, the DOJ wrote. The August search \"cast serious doubt on the claim in the certification ... that there had been 'a diligent search' for records responsive to the grand jury subpoena,\" according to the DOJ's filing. Of the evidence taken in that raid, \"over one hundred unique documents with classification markings \u2014 that is, more than twice the amount produced on June 3, 2022, in response to the grand jury subpoena \u2014 were seized,\" the DOJ wrote. \"That the FBI, in a matter of hours, recovered twice as many documents with classification markings as the 'diligent search' that the former President's counsel and other representatives had weeks to perform calls into serious question the representations made in the June 3 certification and casts doubt on the extent of cooperation in this matter,\" the DOJ wrote. The prosecutors also argued against the appointment of a special master, saying it is \"unnecessary\" and that doing so \"would significantly harm important governmental interests, including national security interests.\" That harm could include impeding the intelligence community's \"ongoing review of the national security risk\" that may have been caused by \"improper storage of these highly sensitive materials,\" the DOJ argued. The prosecutors concluded that Cannon should reject Trump's requests \"and decline to require the return of seized items, enjoin further review of seized materials, or appoint a special master.\" Tuesday's filing came one day after the DOJ told Cannon that its review of the seized materials was complete. The DOJ told the court on Monday that a law enforcement team had identified a \"limited set\" of materials that may be protected by attorney-client privilege. That privilege often refers to the legal doctrine that protects the confidentiality of communications between an attorney and their client. The so-called privilege review team \u2014 which is separate from the investigation that led the FBI to search Trump's residence earlier this month \u2014 is following a process to \"address potential privilege disputes, if any,\" the DOJ wrote. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence \"is also leading an intelligence community assessment of the potential risk to national security that would result from the disclosure of these materials,\" according to the filing. Before the DOJ posted its late-night response, a group of former government officials asked the judge to let them file a brief as \"amici curiae\" \u2014 Latin for \"friends of the court\" \u2014 arguing against Trump's requests. The group included six former federal prosecutors who served in Republican administrations, as well as former New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, who governed as a Republican but backed President Joe Biden over Trump in 2020."},

But details of how many of those records the Mazars USA accounting firm will turn over were not included in a committee statement announcing the agreement Thursday. The deal does not cover a separate lawsuit involving the House Ways and Means Committee, which is seeking Trump's federal tax returns from 2015 through 2020. Last month, a federal appeals court said the Ways and Means Committee could get those returns. The agreement with the Oversight Committee came nearly two months after another panel of judges in the same appeals court in Washington, D.C., upheld a prior ruling that the Oversight Committee had the authority to subpoena certain of Trump's financial records from Mazars in furtherance of legislative purposes. However, the appeals court also told the committee to winnow the scope of the records it wanted to see. On Wednesday, Trump's lawyers told the court in a filing that in light of the settlement agreement with the Oversight Committee, he would drop a motion seeking a rehearing of the case, and a related one asking that the entire lineup of judges on the appeals court take up the issue. In a statement, committee Chairwoman Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., said, \"After facing years of delay tactics, the Committee has now reached an agreement with the former President and his accounting firm, Mazars USA, to obtain critical documents.\" \"These documents will inform the Committee's efforts to get to the bottom of former President Trump's egregious conduct and ensure that future presidents do not abuse their position of power for personal gain,\" Maloney said. The committee said that under the agreement, \"Mazars USA has agreed to comply with the court's order and produce responsive documents to the Committee as expeditiously as possible.\" A lawyer for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The committee sought the documents in 2019 as part of its investigation into Trump's conflicts of interest involving his businesses while serving as president and his foreign financial ties. The panel issued its subpoena to Mazars for Trump's records after his former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, testified to the Oversight Committee that Trump's financial statements had falsely represented his financial position. Trump then sued to block Mazars from surrendering the records. The case ended up before the Supreme Court, which in 2020 sent the lawsuit back to lower federal courts with the direction to apply a new standard for evaluating the merit of congressional subpoenas for a president's personal information."},

The three major U.S. indices were set for a slightly higher open Wednesday after three straight days of losses that stretch back to Friday, when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank would continue its aggressive fight against inflation. Still, some observers think we've seen the worst for stocks this year, given how they bounced back. The S&P 500 surged 17% from its June low to the peak in August, Charles Schwab's Randy Frederick pointed out. \"That's a pretty impressive rally,\" he said. \"It would be very rare to give all of that back because it just doesn't happen very often.\" Bed Bath & Beyond unveiled its new business plan Wednesday. It includes $500 million in new financing, as well as plans for layoffs and store closures. The announcement was heavily telegraphed. Multiple reports had already said that the troubled home-goods retailer was close to securing a loan to help pay suppliers and keep the lights on. The company also announced a share offering Wednesday morning, which sent shares falling. Bed Bath's disarray has stretched from its unpopular new merchandising strategy in stores to its executive offices (several top executives, including CEO Mark Tritton, left earlier this year) to markets, where activist investor and meme stock maven Ryan Cohen cashed out his stake this month. Price increases in the euro zone hit a new record this month, according to Europe's statistics authority. Inflation rose at a rate of 9.1%, slightly beating economists' projections of 9%. It marks the ninth straight month of record consumer price increases. The main culprit is energy prices, a consequence of Russia's war on Ukraine. Adding to that anxiety is a scheduled maintenance period, from Wednesday through Sunday, for the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline, which runs from Russia to Germany. Russia has gradually choked off gas supply in recent weeks, which Germany considers a political move as European nations support Ukraine in the war and prepare for the coming winter. We're going to have to wait a little longer for NASA to launch its highly anticipated Artemis 1 mission to the moon. Originally set for Monday, the launch was bumped by officials Wednesday night to Saturday. But even that attempt might not happen if weather is bad, or if the engine issue is such a hangup that the rocket would need to be moved off the launchpad for more significant repairs. That could mean weeks or months more of waiting for the already much-delayed mission to take off, according to CNBC's space business reporter, Michael Sheetz. The Justice Department late Tuesday released its latest filing in its national security probe of former President Donald Trump's handling of sensitive government documents at his private Mar-a-Lago residence in South Florida. The filing said records were likely moved and hidden, and \"that efforts were likely taken to obstruct the government's investigation.\" It added: \"That the FBI, in a matter of hours, recovered twice as many documents with classification markings as the 'diligent search' that the former President's counsel and other representatives had weeks to perform calls into serious question the representations made in the June 3 certification and casts doubt on the extent of cooperation in this matter.\" Trump has accused the FBI of being corrupt and has dismissed the investigation, one of several he's facing, as a witch hunt. \u2014 CNBC's Samantha Subin, Melissa Repko, Hannah Ward-Glenton, Sam Meredith, Michael Sheetz, Dan Mangan and Kevin Breuninger contributed to this report. \u2014 Sign up now for the CNBC Investing Club to follow Jim Cramer's every stock move.

But some of that's because this is temporary and the analysts expect the earnings to pull back to around $12 in following years, although it's still fairly cheap on that number, too.\" Tellurian is \"not expected to begin shipping liquefied natural gas until 2026, but they finally started building their first facility in Louisiana earlier this year,\" Cramer said. \"This makes Tellurian inherently speculative, though, and they'll probably have to do more than one round of fundraising between now and 2026 to keep everything on track,\" Cramer said. However, he added, the longer Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues and disrupts European gas supply, the \"more realistic\" Tellurian's vision becomes. Cramer noted in April he encouraged viewers to wait for a pullback in Tellurian shares. At the time, it traded around $6 per share. Now, it's at $4 per share, and Cramer said he thinks it's worth buying here. He also noted Cheniere co-founder Charif Souki is also co-founder and executive chair of Tellurian. While Cheniere and Tellurian represent more pure-play LNG companies, Sempra Energy is \"more of a diversified utility with a liquefied natural gas export kicker,\" Cramer said. \"We've got Sempra in the bullpen for the Charitable Trust. ... We're just waiting for a pullback to buy this one because they reported a great quarter. This is the right time to own a utility,\" Cramer said. Excelerate Energy went public in mid-April, Cramer noted, calling the company \"the rare recent IPO I can get behind.\" The company \"owns a fleet of ships that work as floating LNG import facilities. If you want to start importing this stuff, Excelerate's the cheapest and fastest way to do it,\" Cramer explained. \"Now, the stock had been on a nice roll, but in recent weeks it's been clobbered, including a nasty 8% decline just yesterday, possibly because European regulators started talking about imposing price controls on natural gas,\" Cramer said. \"Still, Excelerate's started making deals with European countries that desperately need energy. Even before that, they had 223% revenue growth in the second quarter, but now you're basically getting that quarter for free.\" Cramer did caution, however, that Excelerate is slightly more speculative, so it might be better for younger investors who can take on more risk. \"While this company's basically a toll road operator for energy, they've also got a number of irons in the fire for liquefied natural gas,\" Cramer said. Just over a month ago, Enbridge announced a partnership with Pacific Energy to build an LNG export terminal in British Columbia. Plus, their pipeline network transports a great deal of the gas that goes to other people's export terminals. The rise of this sub-sector is terrific for their core business. It may take a long time to kick in, but Enbridge is paying you to wait with that 6.3% yield.\" Sign up now for the CNBC Investing Club to follow Jim Cramer's every move in the market. Disclaimer"},

There are predetermined options ranging from 15% to 25% for each transaction. \"We encourage people to tip but it's not mandatory, obviously,\" Sirotkina said.

Tipping 20% at a sit-down restaurant is still the standard, etiquette experts say. But there's less consensus when it comes to a carry-out coffee or take-away snack. Overall, tipping has remained largely flat at quick-service restaurants, according to Toast 's most recent restaurant trends report. Tips average 17%, nearly unchanged from a year ago. But when it comes to takeout, customers are tipping less \u2014 now down to 14.5%, on average, after climbing earlier in the pandemic, the restaurant software vendor found. Other payment software providers have also reported that these types of tips have fallen over the last year. For example, Toast's rival, Square, found that the average tip at quick-service restaurants, which includes cafes and coffee shops, fell from 17.2% to 15.2% from March 2021 to the end of February, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal. \"Part of it is tip fatigue,\" said Eric Plam, founder and CEO of San Francisco-based startup Uptip, which aims to facilitate cashless tipping. \"During Covid, everyone was shell-shocked and feeling generous,\" Plam said. Now, \"you are starting to see people pull back a little bit,\" he noted, particularly when it comes to point-of-sale tipping, which prompts customers to tip even before they've received the product or service. \"This point-of-sale tipping is what people resist the most,\" he said, \"compelling you to tip right there on the spot.\" However, transactions are increasingly cashless and workers in the service industry are earning minimum or less than minimum wage so having a method to tip is critical, Plam added. In fact, the average wage for fast-food and counter workers is $14.34 an hour for full-time staff and $12.14 for part-time employees \u2014 including tips \u2014 according to the most recent data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. A landmark bill in California aims to raise the minimum wage to up to $22 an hour for fast-food and quick-service workers at chains with more than 100 locations nationally. California's current wage floor is $15.50 an hour. President Joe Biden and many Democratic lawmakers have pushed for a $15 hourly wage floor across the U.S. The current federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour and has remained unchanged since 2009. \"We are sympathetic but it doesn't feel good,\" Plam said of point-of-sale tipping. \"Now that the pandemic is essentially over, its starting to shake out now,\" he added. \"The good news is we're rethinking it.\" Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube."},

Hiring at U.S. small businesses with fewer than 50 employees has slowed for five straight months, according to data from Paychex and IHS Markit, but Mucci said that has more to do with a lack of applicants than a reflection of small businesses pulling back. \"For small businesses, the toughest thing is they have the demand, and they have the need for workers \u2014 they just have a little bit harder time finding it,\" he said. That is counter to what is happening at some larger companies. In August, private payrolls grew by 132,000, a drop from the 268,000 gain seen in July, according to ADP's monthly payroll report. ADP chief economist Nela Richardson told CNBC that the data \"suggests a shift toward a more conservative pace of hiring, possibly as companies try to decipher the economy's conflicting signals.\" \"We could be at an inflection point, from super-charged job gains to something more normal,\" she added. But the ADP data showed that while companies with 500 or more employees grew by 54,000 and medium-sized businesses added 53,000, those with fewer than 50 employees saw a 25,000 gain. Mucci said that there are small businesses that are feeling the \"inflationary pressure of wages.\" Hourly earnings on average were $30.71 in August, up $1.51 from the same month last year, according to Paychex. Hourly earnings were up 5.18 % in the month, matching a record set in May dating back to 2011. The difficulty of both finding workers and having to pay higher wages could lead to a continued slowing of hiring activity, Mucci said, adding that \"both of these things are going to slow [hiring] down a bit.\" Fifty percent of small business owners said it was harder to hire in the third quarter of 2022 than it was a year ago, according to a recent CNBC/SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey, while 28% say they have open roles they haven't been able to fill for at least three months. While those figures are relatively unchanged from previous quarters, it highlights the difficulty around hiring that many small business owners are facing. There were 11.24 million job openings in July, with openings outnumbering available workers by nearly a 2-to-1 margin, according to the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey. Friday's August nonfarm payrolls release from the Bureau of Labor Statistics is expected to further the view that hiring demand remains high. That labor crunch has forced many small businesses to reduce hours or close on certain days, Mucci said. However, he noted there are record numbers of workers with at least two jobs, according to federal labor data. In July, there were 433,000 workers with two full-time jobs, compared to 401,000 in July 2021, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \"A lot of people are looking for a second job, and hopefully small businesses will be the positive recipient of that,\" he said."},

Meanwhile, 40% said they despise billionaires. Many also said that billionaires have the responsibility to better society but aren't doing enough. As the rich get richer, 66% of adults see wealth inequality as a serious national issue, and nearly half of Americans, or 47%, believe that there should be a limit to wealth accumulation, the report also found. Of those polled, 24% said personal wealth should be capped at less than $1 billion, while 20% said it should be capped somewhere between $1 billion and $10 billion. There are roughly 200 people in the U.S. who are currently worth more than $10 billion, according to Forbes' annual ranking of the richest people. Among the top five, Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffett, Bill Gates and Elon Musk are all worth more than $100 billion. Meanwhile, extreme wealth inequality was exacerbated by the Covid pandemic, other reports also show. The richest Americans have continued to benefit from owning equities and real estate, particularly last year when both the stock market and home values soared. As of the end of 2021, the top 1% owned a record 32.3% of the nation's wealth. On the flipside, the share of wealth held by the bottom 90% of Americans fell since before the pandemic, to 30.2% from 30.5%. In the Harris poll, 58% of Americans were resentful of wealth accumulation over this period, when others suffered from the financial fallout brought on by the sudden economic downturn. The widening divide between the haves and have-nots highlights the need for more taxes on the wealthiest, according to a report released in May by Oxfam, the global charity focused on eliminating poverty. President Joe Biden has his own plan to make the wealthy pay more as part of his 2023 federal budget. \"Right now, the average billionaire \u2014 there are about 790 of them or so in America \u2014 has a federal tax rate of 8%,\" Biden tweeted. The Billionaire Minimum Income Tax would assess a 20% minimum tax rate on U.S. households worth more than $100 million. Over half the revenue could come from those worth more than $1 billion. But despite growing public support for higher taxes on the ultra-wealthy, billionaire tax proposals have failed to gain traction. Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube."},

But the majority haven't changed their portfolios, according to research from Fidelity Investments. Only 5% of 401(k) and 403(b) investors shifted asset allocations during the second quarter of 2022, the report found, slightly lower than the 5.3% who made changes the quarter prior. Among the savers who made adjustments, the majority of investors only made one, with the top change involving shifts to more conservative assets, the findings show. More from Investor Toolkit:\n3 tips for paying down your credit card balances\nHouse Democrats calling for Social Security reform\nInvestors are flocking to green energy funds It's not surprising, since many 401(k) investors use so-called target-date funds, a \"set it and forget it\" option that automatically and gradually shifts the investor's allocation to more conservative assets as they approach retirement. These changes aren't part of the 5% Fidelity noted, since the fund makes the adjustments. Indeed, 95% of 401(k) plans offered target date funds in 2021, according to Vanguard, and 81% of participants used these funds. However, if you want your portfolio to reflect concerns around the economy, here are some options to consider. While there may be limited options to hedge inflation in a 401(k) plan, investors may have more choices in other accounts, said certified financial planner Bill Brancaccio, co-owner of Rightirement Wealth Partners in Harrison, New York. His firm began shifting client portfolios last summer, expecting higher inflation with the possibility of rising interest rates. \"You have to make changes before the train leaves the station,\" he said. A \"broad basket of commodities,\" including energy, materials and metals, typically 3% to 10% of the overall portfolio, has been a good addition, he said. \"If we're going to have persistent inflation, commodities are a really good hedge against that,\" he added, noting the assets may also perform well as interest rates rise. While many advisors built portfolios to withstand volatility, do-it-yourself investors may still have room for improvement, said CFP Anthony Watson, founder and president of Thrive Retirement Specialists in Dearborn, Michigan. For example, you'll want to consider your bonds' so-called duration, which measures sensitivity to interest rate changes. Expressed in years, duration factors in the coupon, time to maturity and yield paid through the term. \"You want to make sure that your bonds are lower in duration,\" because when interest rates are rising, you can reinvest the proceeds sooner to earn more, Watson said. And you'll want to make sure there's \"high-quality bond exposure,\" including so-called investment-grade bonds, he said, which are generally lower risk because the issuer is less likely to default. While market interest rates and bond prices move in opposite directions \u2014 higher rates make values fall \u2014 these assets still play a key role to diversify the portfolio during prolonged downturns, Brancaccio said."},

U.S. equities markets were primed for another selloff Thursday morning after closing out August on a losing streak. Things had looked promising for stocks this summer after a terrible first half of the year. Inflation eased, but only a bit \u2013 and that has the Federal Reserve ready to hike rates even more. Right now the Fed's benchmark rate is in the 2.25% to 2.5% range, but Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said Wednesday she sees rates rising significantly higher to over 4%. Nor does she expect the central bank to cut rates next year. The Fed is expected to hike rates by another three quarters of a point later this month. Shares of Nvidia fell in off-hours trading after the chip maker said the U.S. government is restricting sales to China out of concerns the Chinese military would use the company's products. Nvidia said it expects to lose about $400 million in revenue from China during the current quarter. The United States has in recent years sought to crack down on China from exploiting U.S.-made technology. Last month, President Joe Biden signed a bipartisan bill that was intended to boost America's chip-making sector in a bid to strengthen the country's competitive power in its economic struggle with China. Even Sam's Club, Walmart 's warehouse chain, isn't immune to inflation. The company said Wednesday that it was raising its entry-level membership fee for Sam's Club for the first time in nine years. Starting Oct. 17, members will pay $50 a year, up from $45. Warehouse stores have done well of late, as inflation-weary shoppers buy in bulk to save on essential items. Walmart's decision could put pressure on Sam's Club rival Costco, which charges $60 a year for its basic membership. In July, Costco's CEO, Craig Jelinek, told CNBC that he didn't think it was the \"right time\" to hike the club fee \u2014 or the price it charges for its famously inexpensive hot dogs. The FDA has approved a new round of Covid booster shots that target the highly contagious omicron BA.5 subvariant.

{"url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/31/walmart-invests-in-ranchers-company-as-shoppers-favor-premium-beef.html", "title": "Walmart invests in ranchers' company as more shoppers opt for premium beef", "tag": "Retail", "author": "Melissa Repko", "datetime": "2022-08-31 13:00:01", "paragraphs": " As more grocery shoppers opt for higher quality meats, Walmart said Wednesday that it is investing in a company led by ranchers and beef producers to bulk up its supply. The retailer is taking a minority stake in Sustainable Beef, which plans to open a processing facility in North Platte, a small town in west-central Nebraska that is home to the former ranch of storied Western showman Buffalo Bill Cody. It expects to break ground next month and create 800 jobs. Walmart declined to disclose the specific amount of its investment. As part of the deal, however, the retailer will get the majority of beef produced at the facility, which is expected to open by late 2024, said Tyler Lehr, senior vice president of merchandising for deli services, meat and seafood for Walmart U.S. It will also get representation on the company's board. For the retailer, the deal means a larger, more consistent supply of beef, including better cuts. For shoppers, it will show up in the form of ground beef and steaks \u2014 including ribeye, sirloin and New York strip \u2014 in its meat department. Walmart will source Angus from the company, a type of beef that comes from a cattle breed often associated with more flavor because of its marbling. The beef will hit store shelves in the central part of the country starting in late 2024, Lehr said. Walmart, the country's largest grocer by revenue, is making investments in agriculture and food production as consumers eat differently and crave more information about the items they toss in their shopping carts. The company invested earlier this year in Plenty, a California-based startup that grows leafy greens indoors and closer to urban centers. The agriculture method of vertical farming uses less water, eliminates the need for pesticides and requires less transportation to get to the store shelf. Two years ago, Walmart opened a beef-processing facility for Angus beef in Thomasville, Ga., and in 2018, it opened a high-tech dairy plant in Fort Wayne, Ind. The Sustainable Beef investment also feeds Walmart's environmental and social commitments. By 2030, the retailer, along with the company's foundation, has pledged to protect, restore or more sustainably manage at least 50 million acres of land and 1 million square miles of ocean by 2030. And two years ago, it said it would work toward sourcing more sustainable fresh beef by working with ranchers on grazing management, grain sourcing and more. Groceries drive almost 60% of Walmart's U.S. sales, according to its most recent annual report. Fresh groceries like fruits, vegetables and meats are especially a growth driver and influence where people choose to shop, Lehr said. \"Customers continue to tell us one of the biggest points of differentiation is they want to know where it comes from,\" Lehr said. \"They like to know and learn a little bit more about it rather than just seeing it on the meat counter. There's a greater drive and desire for them to know what the backstory is on the products that they're purchasing in store.\" During the past months of rising inflation, Walmart's reputation for low prices has attracted middle- and high-income shoppers looking to save on groceries and essentials, including some who may seek premium cuts of meat. In the most recent quarter ended July 31, Walmart said about three-quarters of the company's market share gains in food came from customers with annual household incomes of $100,000 or more. The discounter cut its full-year profit guidance last month, but increased its projections for sales growth, citing gains in its grocery category. Grocery shoppers, especially younger generations, expect more from their food \u2014 even as they watch their budget, said Rob Dongoski, food and agribusiness leader for consulting firm EY. Along with seeking tasty and affordable items, they consider other attributes, such as whether an animal was treated humanely or if produce was grown in a more sustainable way. They may look for labels associated with health or wellness, too, such as \"organic,\" \"grass-fed\" or \"antibiotic free.\" And, Dongoski said, some of those consumers are willing to pay more for them. \"There's a renewed interest in food,\" he said. \"Boomers and Gen Xers affiliated status with their car and their house and food was a necessity and needs-based purchase. If you look at Gen Zers and millennials, cars and houses are more needs-based and food is more status. We've seen a real difference in that attitude.\" Those evolving preferences have changed the look of Walmart's meat department, too. On a store tour earlier this summer with Walmart's Chief Merchandising Officer Charles Redfield near the big-box retailer's Arkansas headquarters, he pointed to fridges full of beef. Inside of the chilled area, there is now a larger number of steaks on black trays versus white ones. The black trays are for choice beef, a higher-quality cut that's juicier and more flavorful, and the white trays are for select beef, a lower standard of meat that's less marbled and tender.

The remarks by Joe Erlinger, president of McDonald's U.S., come after the California state Senate earlier this week passed a bill that would give a 10-person council the authority to raise the industry's minimum wage to up to $22 an hour for chains with more than 100 locations nationally. California's current wage floor is $15.50 an hour. The council would also have the authority to establish safety conditions. Proponents of the bill say it will empower fast-food workers and help solve industry problems such as unsafe working conditions and wage theft, which can include not paying employees for overtime. But the FAST Act faces strong opposition from the restaurant industry, which fears the impact on California restaurants and the example it sets for other states. \"It imposes higher costs on one type of restaurant, while sparing another. That's true even if those two restaurants have the same revenues and the same number of employees,\" Erlinger wrote in a letter posted to the company's site Wednesday. For example, Erlinger said a McDonald's franchisee with two locations would be subject to the bill, since it's part of a large national chain. But he said the owner of 20 restaurants that aren't part of a chain would be exempt. \"Aggressive wage increases are not bad. ... But if it's essential to increase restaurant workers' wages and protect their welfare \u2013 and it is \u2013 shouldn't all restaurant workers benefit?\" Erlinger wrote. It's rare for McDonald's to speak out publicly against state legislation, although the chain was reportedly pushing its franchisees to lobby against the California bill. Nearly 10% of McDonald's U.S. restaurants are located in California, according to Citi Research. \"The legislative process has run its course over the past eight months on this bill, and I have had an open door policy to work with the administration, corporations, workers, and franchisees because I acknowledge the importance of working together,\" Assemblymember Chris Holden, a sponsor of the bill, said in a statement to CNBC. McDonald's only operates about 5% of its more than 13,000 U.S. locations. Its franchisees own the rest, but the chain often lobbies on their behalf. I n 2019, McDonald's told the National Restaurant Association it would no longer oppose federal, state or local minimum wage hikes. Other restaurant companies have been fighting the bill as well. State records show that Chipotle Mexican Grill, Chick-fil-A, Yum Brands and Restaurant Brands International are among the chains that have been spending money to lobby California lawmakers to oppose the legislation. The National Restaurant Association, an industry group, has also spent at least $140,000 to fight the bill, according to California records. The organization's president, Michelle Korsmo, said in a statement that 45% of California restaurant operators report that business conditions are worse today than they were three months ago. \"The FAST Act isn't going to achieve its objective of providing a better environment for the workforce, it's going to force the outcomes our communities don't want to see,\" she said. A stricter version of the FAST Act that would make franchisors like McDonald's liable for their franchisees' labor violations passed the California state Assembly. But the number of changes made to the Senate version mean the bill will have be voted on again in the Assembly or reconciled before it can make its way to Gov. Gavin Newsom's desk. Newsom hasn't indicated whether he'll sign or veto the bill, although his Department of Finance opposed the initial version of the legislation."},

Reps. Jared Huffman, D-Calif., Ra\u00fal M. Grijalva, D-Ariz., chair of the Natural Resources committee, and Kathy Castor, D-Fla., chair of the Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, wrote a letter to the U.S. comptroller general on Tuesday arguing that climate offset programs are often fraudulent and mislead consumers without taking meaningful action. Carbon offset projects allow businesses, governments and people to balance out their own carbon emissions by supporting various climate initiatives that reduce or sequester an equal amount of carbon pollution. But some officials and climate advocates argue that these programs are often scams or forms of greenwashing because they don't result in additional emissions reductions. Offset projects often conserve habitats able to store carbon, including forests, grasslands, wetlands and blue carbon ecosystems (like mangroves and tidal salt marshes). In some cases, though, the habitats would have been preserved anyway, and long-term enforcement is seen by some as lax to nonexistent. What's more, there's currently no way to prevent double counting where the same credit is used by multiple parties. The representatives noted that the metrics to gauge the efficacy of such offsets \u2014 including measuring, reporting and verification \u2014 vary depending on the program. The difference in metrics makes it difficult for people to understand their purchase and for policymakers to quantify their impact, they said. The members requested that the Government Accountability Office conduct a study on federal efforts to quantify carbon reductions from offsets, and recommended actions agencies can take to increase transparency in private voluntary carbon offset markets and prevent fraud and abuse. \"Markets thrive with transparency, while a lack of transparency carries inherent market risk,\" the representatives wrote in the letter. \"Consumers of voluntary climate offsets require transparency and well-defined standards in the natural carbon offsets market given the wide variety and possibility for fraud.\" Some climate advocates have also argued that purchasing offset credits should count as climate philanthropy rather than as a way for organizations to balance out their emissions, and have urged emissions reductions through other methods, such as investing in permanent carbon removal. \"Because standards are nonexistent, it's easy to mislead consumers with the promise of carbon offsets,\" Huffman wrote in a tweet on Tuesday. \"We must ensure transparency so that when folks sign up to help the environment, it actually happens.\""},

On a call with investors, the New Jersey-based retailer laid out details of its latest turnaround push. It said it has started closing about 150 of its \"lower producing\" namesake stores. It will also slash costs by shrinking head count by about 20% across its corporate and supply chain workforce. To strengthen its balance sheet, the company said it secured more than $500 million in new financing, including a loan. The moves are urgently needed for the troubled retailer, which also disclosed Wednesday that slowing sales have carried into the most recent quarter. Same-store sales plummeted 26% for the three-month period ended Aug. 27 \u2014 an even steeper drop than the declines of recent quarters. Bed Bath's shares closed down 21% at $9.53 Wednesday. Its business had already taken many blows. The company said it lost hundreds of millions of dollars in sales because it didn't have items in stock. It was publicly criticized by activist investor Ryan Cohen, who later sold off his entire stake in the company. Former CEO Mark Tritton, who was chosen to carve out a successful strategy, was ousted by the board in June. Yet the company said its new approach can win back shoppers who have strayed to competitors. \"There is still an incredible degree of love for Bed Bath & Beyond,\" said Mara Sirhal, the newly named brand president of Bed Bath & Beyond. \"We must get back to our rightful place as the home category destination, and our goal is to achieve this by leading with the product and brands our customers want.\" For its baby goods chain, Buybuy Baby, the company also named Patty Wu as brand president. One of Bed Bath's crucial moves was finding a way to pay the bills and stabilize relationships with suppliers leery of working with a faltering company. It counts on those vendors to stock shelves and warehouses \u2014 especially during important seasons like back to college and the Christmas season. Bed Bath has burned through cash, ending May with about $100 million compared with $1.1 billion a year earlier. It said Wednesday it has a plan to cut costs and gain additional cash. It secured a $375 million loan through Sixth Street Partners, a lender that has provided financing to other retailers including J.C. Penney and Designer Brands. It has expanded $1.13 billion asset-backed revolving credit facility, too. Earlier in the day, it said in a filing that it will sell an undisclosed amount of shares. Along with the additional financing, it is slashing costs. Its store footprint will get about 16% smaller with the closures. As of late May, the company had 955 stores. That includes 769 namesake stores, 135 Buybuy Baby stores and 51 stores under its Harmon or Face Values brands. Bed Bath also said it is eliminating the jobs of chief operating officer and chief stores officer. To try to stand out from competitors, Bed Bath previously made an aggressive push into private-label products and launched nine exclusive brands since the spring of 2021. Yet instead of drumming up more sales, some shoppers felt disoriented by the unfamiliar names showcased prominently in store displays and had trouble finding the national brands they wanted. Now, Bed Bath will backpedal from that approach and bring back more of the name brands that people recognize, such as Calphalon, Cuisinart and Oxo, Sirhal said. It will discontinue three of its private-label brands \u2212 Haven, Wild Sage and Studio 3B \u2212 and significantly reduce the inventory of the others, she said. She said it will also work with national brands to develop exclusive products and add more direct-to-consumer brands. On the Buybuy Baby side, Wu said the baby goods chain wants to build on its brand and differentiate by becoming the go-to retailer and advisor for parents and families. \"If you think about how parents used to rely on volumes of heavy books to learn about what to expect, we're here to help new parents who are digitally savvy and native and who rely on their smartphones for everyday living,\" she said. In stores and online, Wu said it will demonstrate products, provide recommendations and build a community that parents can turn to for advice from pregnancy to early preschool years. Buybuy Baby is also seeking new standout products and automatically enrolling parents with a baby registry in its loyalty program, she said. Bed Bath's shares have been on a meme stock-fueled roller-coaster ride for months, rocketing up to $30.06 and falling to a low of $4.38 in the past year. As of Tuesday's close of $12.11, the shares are down about 17% year to date. Read the company's news release here."},

Fees will increase to $50 from $45 for club members and to $110 from $100 for members of its higher-tier level, \"Plus,\" which includes some additional perks. The changes take effect Oct. 17. It marks the first fee hike in nine years for the entry-level membership. Sam's Club has not raised the price of the \"Plus\" membership since it debuted in 1999. That brings Sam's closer in price to rival Costco, which charges $60 a year for its basic membership and $120 for its higher-tier \"Gold\" membership. Sam's Club is hiking annual fees as warehouse clubs benefit from budget-conscious customers. Shoppers turned to Costco, BJ's Wholesale Club and Sam's Club during the early months of the Covid pandemic to stock up on huge packs of toilet paper, household cleaners and cans of soup. In recent months, those shoppers have sought relief from inflation by seeking out cheaper gas and high volume discounts. At the same time, inflation may make the increase sting. In a note to members Wednesday afternoon, Sam's Club CEO Kath McLay said the company is \"mindful of the financial pressure on wallets right now.\" With that in mind, she said, Sam's Club will pick up the tab this year by reimbursing the fee increase in Sam's Cash that can be used at its stores. Investors have speculated about a potential hike in Costco's fees, too. The club last raised its fee in June 2017 and has historically bumped it up every 5\u00bd years, which would put it on track for this year. Costco CEO Craig Jelinek shook off talk of an increase on CNBC's \" Squawk on the Street\" in July. \"I can tell you that we think about it every year, but right now, in terms of the membership fee it's not on the table right at the moment,\" he said. \"I've made it very clear. I don't think it's the right time.\" Sam's Club has almost 600 stores across the U.S. and in Puerto Rico. It does not disclose its membership count, but said in the most recent quarter that it is at an all-time high. Membership income increased 8.9% in the quarter that ended July 31. Its sales growth is outpacing other parts of Walmart's business. Same-store sales at Sam's Club grew 9.5% in the most recently reported quarter versus 6.5% at Walmart U.S. Chief Member and Marketing Officer Ciara Anfield said Sam's Club decided to make the move because of investments in recent years, from elevating the quality of merchandise on its shelves to adding new and convenient ways to shop. In recent years, it has added curbside pickup at stores, offered same-day home delivery, refreshed its Member's Mark private brand and launched Scan & Go, a smartphone app that people can use to ring up items as they walk through aisle. It has started carrying brands such as Eddie Bauer, La Mer and Banana Republic. And even some of its bakery treats have gotten a gourmet spin, such as cinnamon rolls made with a French baking technique. She compared the rollout of those new perks to building a house or spending money on renovation projects. \"There's an expectation that after you invest in this home, it will be worth more,\" Anfield said. \"We've made investments and we believe our proposition, our membership is now worth more.\""},

Here are the August delivery numbers for the three companies: Nio was the only company to grow on a monthly basis in August but U.S.-listed shares of the EV start-up fell more than 8%. Li Auto shares fell around 4% while Xpeng was down more than 6%. The Chinese economy is facing a number of challenges including a resurgence of Covid-19 that has seen major cities like Shanghai locked down. In the last few days Shenzhen, China's tech hub has enacted Covid restrictions and on Thursday, the mega city of Chengdu went into lockdown. While some cities may have opened up again, consumer sentiment remains fragile and uncertainty prevails as a result of China's \"zero-Covid\" policy. The world's second-largest economy is also facing a power crunch which is impacting electric vehicle charging stations. Last month, Tesla and Nio suspended some of their charging services. These issues are filtering through to EV sales. Bill Russo, CEO at Shanghai-based Automobility, told CNBC, the numbers are \"reflective of lingering supply chain issues as well as the fact that they're on the premium end of the price range and with the weakening economy, people are looking toward affordability and that's squeezing some of the higher priced models.\" Last month, Xpeng said it expects to deliver between 29,000 and 31,000 electric vehicles in the third quarter of the year. This guidance disappointed investors. Xpeng President Brian Gu said the guidance reflects the fact that the industry is entering a \"relatively slow season\" and that traffic in stores is less due to the Covid situation. Yanan Shen, president of Li Auto, said in an earnings call last month that the Covid outbreak \"severely affected\" the company's supply chains and that there are remaining \"disruptions and difficulties.\" Shen also said there had been a slowdown in order intake for its flagship Li ONE sports utility vehicle. Li Auto began to deliver its new L9 car to customers at the end of August. And the company said it is planning to launch and deliver a large SUV called the Li L8 in early November. That could be affecting sales of its Li ONE, according to Russo. \"Li has major new product launches with the L9 and L8 which is also impacting consumer demand for Li ONE. When new products come out, demand for the older model often suffers,\" Russo said. To spur demand, China said last month it would extend its tax exemption for new energy vehicle purchases until the end of 2023. Competition continues to heat up in China's electric vehicle market. Alongside Li Auto's new cars, Xpeng plans to begin deliveries of its new G9 SUV in October and launch two new vehicles next year."},

In addition, Warner Bros. Discovery is bringing in Alan Taylor as a director and executive producer for the second season of \"House of the Dragon.\" Taylor directed seven episodes of \"Game of Thrones\" and was nominated for two Emmys for his work on the show. \"Miguel Sapochnik has done amazing work on the first season of 'House of the Dragon,' establishing its signature look and feel,\" HBO said in a statement. \"This series simply could not have come together the way it did without him.\" \"House of the Dragon\" is off to a strong start for HBO, becoming the biggest series premiere in its history following the debut two weeks ago with nearly 10 million viewers tuning in, both linear and streaming. The series was renewed ahead of the launch of the second episode, which amassed 10.2 million views on Sunday night. \"House of the Dragon\" tells the story of the Targaryen civil war that took place about 200 years before the events portrayed in \"Game of Thrones.\" It is based on George R.R. Martin's novel, \"Fire and Blood.\" Unlike Martin's other books in the \"Song of Ice and Fire\" series, this one features an omniscient narrator who documents the histories based on collected accounts of events.

The wait time is a bit longer in North America, where it takes about eight days to get a new Mac, down from 18 days in June. Mac sales were short of consensus expectations in the company's third-quarter earnings report and fell 10% year over year. CEO Tim Cook attributed the drop to supply constraints, which means Apple couldn't make enough computers to meet demand. In April, Apple warned that parts shortages would hit revenue by between $4 billion and $8 billion, and Apple's website showed extended shipping times for many Mac models during the quarter. Cook said the hit ultimately came in under $4 billion. Apple also announced new MacBook Air models in June that began shipping to customers in July.

It represents yet another example of beverage companies blurring the lines between drink categories, seeking to leverage existing brand loyalty while entering fast-growing categories. Gatorade's parent company, PepsiCo, has already expanded Mountain Dew into alcoholic and energy drinks. The company says Fast Twitch is designed to give athletes an extra boost before their workouts. The market for preworkout powders is growing, fueled by industry leaders such as Cellucor C4 and RSP Nutrition. But few preworkout drinks exist, and many consumers instead turn to carbonated, sugary energy drinks. Anuj Bhasin, general manager of Gatorade, said roughly 32 million consumers reject the energy drink category for the negative health effects. Fast Twitch aims to attract those consumers, offering plenty of caffeine but no sugar or carbonation. The new drink is slated to launch in February, but NFL players will be drinking it on sidelines during the upcoming season as part of an exclusive deal with the league. Bhasin said Gatorade worked with the NFL and its sports performance experts to develop the specific formula. The finished product comes in a petite 12-ounce bottle with brightly colored packaging. While smaller, it tastes pretty similar to traditional Gatorade. A bottle of Fast Twitch contains electrolytes, B-vitamins and 200 milligrams of caffeine. For comparison, a 12-ounce can of Red Bull has nearly half as much caffeine but 37 grams of sugar. Bolt24, another recent offshoot of Gatorade, has just 75 milligrams of caffeine in its Energize line, which is being phased out. \"Two hundred milligrams is the right amount to help athletes seeking benefits for exercise performance,\" said Matthew Pahnke, senior principal scientist at the Gatorade Sports Science Institute. Since its creation nearly six decades ago, Gatorade has built its brand on hydration, spreading the word about the benefits of electrolytes and carbohydrates. But caffeine is a natural diuretic, removing salt and water from the body. As a result, Fast Twitch is meant to precede drinking a more hydrating beverage during an actual workout, the company says. \"We know athletes will mix and match things,\" Pahnke said. Fast Twitch will target consumers who are 18 years old or older due to the high caffeine content, according to Bhasin. Fast Twitch follows a broader push by Pepsi into energy drinks. Over the last three years, the company bought Rockstar Energy for $3.85 billion, launched Mtn Dew Rise Energy with the endorsement of NBA superstar Lebron James and acquired a minority stake in up-and-coming energy drink maker Celsius for $550 million. Celsius is a potential competitor for Fast Twitch. The upstart markets its beverages as \"fitness drinks,\" and its marketing shows models swinging kettle bells and stretching. Another challenger also has ties to Gatorade's parent company. Bang Energy, which recently ended an acrimonious distribution deal with Pepsi, markets itself as a preworkout or recovery drink. Beyond being highly caffeinated, it touts \"super creatine,\" which claims to boost muscle performance, but no sugar. But Pepsi is already the dominant leader in the U.S. sports drink category, holding 73.2% market share with Gatorade and G Zero, according to Euromonitor International data. Bodyarmor jumped to second place in 2021 with 11.7% market share, overtaking Coca-Cola 's Powerade. Coke purchased full control of Bodyarmor in November for $5.6 billion in a play to increase its market share. Changing consumer tastes led to slowing sales growth for the sports drink market, even as U.S. adults exercise more. Years of backlash from lawmakers and pediatricians about sports drinks' high sugar and calorie counts didn't help either. But Gatorade staged a comeback, focusing on options with more electrolytes and less sugar, such as recent spin-offs G Fit, Gatorlyte and Bolt24. In the second quarter, Pepsi reported double-digit revenue growth for the Gatorade brand. However, not all of Gatorade's innovations have paid off. An organic version of the drink released in 2016 failed to take off and was discontinued several years later. Energy represents an opportunity in a fast-growing segment, but it lacks trust from consumers who exercise. Gatorade, on the other hand, has earned plenty of trust from that customer base. \"We found this to be the sweet spot of bringing a new brand to market, with the distinction of being from the makers of Gatorade, much like Propel,\" Bhasin said."},

This week, pet products retailer Chewy said it's not seeing any significant trade down among shoppers in pet food. Rival pet retailer Petco made similar remarks last week, though both noted a pullback in spending on products such as leashes and toys. The comments are in line with the trend of pet owners increasingly spoiling their cats and dogs with foods that are more like the dishes they'd feed themselves or other family members. To capitalize on the ongoing shift, Petco recently partnered with snack bar maker Clif to sell a version for pets. It also launched a line of frozen, human-grade meals for dogs. \"Pet parents are driving one of the biggest trends the pet industry has seen as they increasingly seek out fresh, human-grade food for all members of the family,\" Petco CEO Ron Coughlin said in a release. Coughlin said the growing \"humanization\" of animal companions is being led by Gen Z and Millennial consumers who are \"hyper focused\" on their pets' health and wellness. In addition to more premium foods, Chewy and Petco see their health products and services as a way to better compete with the low-price offerings from retailers such as Amazon and Walmart. Earlier this month, Chewy expanded its health offerings with CarePlus, a line of pet wellness and insurance offerings. For its second quarter, Chewy said net sales rose 12.8% from a year ago to $2.43 billion as shoppers shifted toward more fresh and premium food products. Petco said its sales rose 3.2% to $1.48 billion and reported a similar shift. Still, the pet category isn't shielded from the soaring inflation that's pressuring consumers. Both Petco and Chewy reported softening demand in products such as crates, beds, leashes and toys over the summer months. Chewy noted that such items don't have to be replaced as often as some other items, and that shoppers are opting to skip on them as prices rise. Chewy said the downturn in such products is temporary and that it expects demand will recover. Brian LaRose, Petco's chief financial officer, also said orders for the products \"are delayed, not canceled.\" Still, both companies tightened their full-year guidance, in part because of the softened demand. Both companies lowered their revenue guidance for the year. Petco said it now expects adjusted earnings per share of 77 to 81 cents. It previously forecast 97 cents to $1. Petco's shares are down down around 24% year to date, while Chewy's stock is down around 41%."},

This year, the Japanese gaming giant said it plans to release around 50% of games on PC and mobile by 2025, up from about a quarter currently. \"For that to happen, Sony needs to make big bets on mobile gaming,\" Serkan Toto, CEO of Tokyo-based game industry consultancy Kantan Games, told CNBC. And the opportunity is big. Consoles account for about 27% of the $196.8 billion games market, whereas mobile makes up more than half of revenues, according to Newzoo. The purchase of Savage Game Studios continues Sony's recent acquisition drive as it looks to boost the development of titles across platforms. \"PlayStation Studios must continue to expand and diversify our offering beyond console, bringing incredible new games to more people than ever before,\" said Hermen Hulst, head of PlayStation studios. \"Acquiring the talented team at Savage Game Studios is another strategic step towards that goal.\" Sony said that Savage Game Studios is working on an \"unannounced new AAA mobile live service action game.\" A \"triple A\" game is an informal industry classification usually for a blockbuster type of title. A live service game is usually a title where developers continually update and add content to extend its lifetime and generate revenue over a longer period of time. The success of Call of Duty Mobile and Diablo Immortal on mobile, both of which were originally designed for console and PC, show there is demand for well-known titles on smaller screens \"if executed well,\" according to Daniel Ahmad, senior analyst at Niko Partners. Sony's mobile strategy is likely to lean on its massive library of intellectual property (IP) but also with a focus on developing specific games for smaller devices, Kantan Games' Toto said. \"Sony is very likely to not only bring existing PlayStation IPs to mobile but also encourage studios to develop new franchises for smart devices from scratch,\" Toto said. Sony is the latest console maker to make a big step into mobile gaming. Microsoft's Xbox gaming unit has also begun making early moves into mobile. Nintendo has, for the last three years, also been focusing a lot of effort on the smaller screen gaming format. Globally, Sony will compete with companies it hadn't really before, particularly Chinese giants Tencent and NetEase \u2014 two of the world's largest mobile gaming players. But Toto said Sony's chances of success are still high. \"The mobile gaming market is overcrowded. There are over 1 million games in app stores nowadays. But players such as Sony, even if they are new entrants, can still make it just because of their fire power,\" Toto told CNBC. \"There are not many companies like Sony out there, with such strong branding, a whole range of high-performing studios and a treasure trove of valuable IPs.\""},

The decision contradicts a 2019 ruling over dress code policies at Walmart that allowed the retail titan to limit (but not ban) employees from wearing pro-union insignia at work. Two members of the labor board dissented on the Tesla ruling, while three moved to overrule the prior Walmart decision. The majority wrote, \"when an employer interferes in any way with its employees' right to display union insignia, the employer must prove special circumstances that justify its interference.\" Tesla did not demonstrate special circumstances that justified its policy, the NLRB decided. Tesla had previously argued before the NLRB that its dress code was meant to prevent workers' clothing from \"causing mutilations\" to the cars or car seats they were building, and to help managers \"easily determine that employees are in their assigned work areas,\" of the company's factory. Former Tesla employees had testified before the NLRB that management at Tesla made them remove T-shirts with United Auto Workers union messages and logos on them, even though they posed no risk of damaging cars or car seats. The UAW and Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday. Previously, the NLRB ruled that Tesla CEO Elon Musk violated labor laws when he suggested in a tweet that Tesla workers would need to give up their stock options if they unionized. They mandated that he remove the offending tweet, but Musk and Tesla moved to appeal that decision."},

Google said the app lacks effective systems for moderating user-generated content, which violates the store's terms of service. \"On Aug. 19, we notified Truth Social of several violations of standard policies in their current app submission and reiterated that having effective systems for moderating user-generated content is a condition of our terms of service for any app to go live on Google Play,\" the tech company, which is owned by Alphabet, told CNBC in a statement Tuesday. Axios first reported the Google statement. The restriction means that Android users, who make up 44% of smartphone users in the U.S., can't download the app. Google will not let the app go live until the content issues are addressed. Truth Social acknowledged Google's concerns and said it would work on addressing these issues, according to Axios. Trump Media and Technology Group CEO Devin Nunes told a different story. The former lawmaker, who was one of former President Donald Trump's staunchest allies in Congress, said the decision is up to Google and not dependent on Truth Social's policies. \"When are we going to be available on Android? Well, look, that's up to the Google Play store. We're waiting on them to approve us, I don't know what's taking so long,\" Nunes said on the \"Just the News Not Noise\" podcast. \"It sure would be nice if they would approve us.\" Google said that Nunes' statements misrepresent the ongoing dialogue between Trump Media and the Play store. Google reiterated that Truth Social's violations, and the steps to redress them, have been clearly communicated with the company. Trump Media pushed back, saying Truth Social was creating a \"vibrant, family-friendly environment.\" \"TMTG has no desire to litigate its business matters in the public sphere, but for the record, has promptly responded to all inquiries from Google,\" the company said in a press release Tuesday. \"It is our belief that all Americans should have access to Truth Social no matter what devices they use. We look forward to Google approving Truth Social at their earliest convenience.\" Trump Media and Technology Group made the app available for preorder on Android in early August. It is available on Apple's App Store. Google's YouTube has suspended Trump's channel. Android users can still access Truth Social through the platform's website. The restriction is one of several obstacles faced by the former president's app. Truth Social was created as a \"free-speech\" alternative to Twitter, after Trump was banned from the platform for his tweets relating to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Hundreds of the president's supporters stormed the building that day to try to block Congress from confirming Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election. Trump, who had about 88 million followers on Twitter, has about 4 million followers on Truth Social, where he continues to push false claims about the election. He is facing a criminal investigation over secret government records he took with him to his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida and is considering another run for the White House. Trump Media was set to go public through a merger with Digital World Acquisition Corporation, a special-purpose acquisition company. The deadline is Sept. 8, although DWAC is pushing for a delay of up to a year. DWAC warned shareholders that a decline in the former president's popularity could hurt the app and that, without a delay, the acquisition company may have to liquidate. DWAC scheduled a shareholder meeting for Sept. 6, two days before the current merger deadline. Shares of the company were down more than 2% Tuesday at $24.65, far from their peak of about $97 in March."},

The move sees the former NASA chief throw his experience and reputation behind a startup with a unique propellant technology. Bridenstine has joined up with larger, established organizations since leaving the space agency. Bridenstine served at NASA during former President Donald Trump's administration, and now holds a variety of roles within the space industry \u2013 including as senior advisor to private equity group Acorn Growth, and on the boards of Viasat and The Aerospace Corp. El Segundo, California-based Phase Four builds next-generation electric thrusters for small satellites, with six operating in orbit so far. The company has raised about $30 million in funding since its founding in 2015. Bridenstine told CNBC that Phase Four's approach of using radio frequency to utilize a wide variety of propellant types \u2013 including xenon, krypton, iodine and water \u2013 is \"going to be an absolute game changer for these proliferated [low Earth orbit satellite] constellations.\" Phase Four's propellant flexibility gives the company stability in the face of a geopolitical threat, Bridenstine said. Noble gases xenon and krypton \u2014 often used as spacecraft propellants \u2014 are \"not widely available\" and largely produced in Russia, Ukraine and China. \"The idea that we can get away from those traditional fuels and get into things like iodine and water, I think [should] significantly drop costs and create an environment where you don't have as many opportunities for disruption,\" Bridenstine said. That supply chain threat is also a focus of the Pentagon's work in space. \"I think the Space Force is very interested in making sure that that we do have consistent supply chains that are not at risk, and we don't have to be spending money with countries that aren't friendly with us,\" Bridenstine added. Phase Four has contracts to develop and produce thrusters from the Air Force and DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, as well as commercial orders from companies like Capella Space. The company has 32 employees and is expanding into a 23,000-square-foot facility in Hawthorne, California. It plans to raise another funding round in 2023 and to grow to about 50 people over the next 12 months. CEO Beau Jarvis told CNBC that his relationship with Bridenstine dates back to when Jarvis was a vice president at satellite imagery company Planet and the latter was a congressman. At the time, Bridenstine was \"trying to make it easier for small space companies to be able to work with the Department of Defense, or more broadly, the U.S. government,\" Jarvis said. \"Seeing some of what Jim has talked about more recently, in terms of having more sustainable space operations, and the potential for debris issues in space ... there's a lot of overlap [between] Jim's vision and our vision,\" Jarvis said."},

In the forthcoming book, \"Like, Comment, Subscribe: Inside YouTube\u2019s Chaotic Rise to World Domination,\" author Mark Bergen writes that the executive, known for being loyal to Google cofounders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, talked about becoming Tesla's Chief Operating Officer before becoming YouTube CEO in 2014. At the time, Wojcicki had been senior vice president of ads and commerce at Google and had been looking for a higher-level role, the book said, citing those close to her. \u201cBy then, Page had begun plotting his own exit \u2014 a plan to hand Google off to a trusted deputy, Sundar Pichai,\" Bergen reports. In a conversation, Laszlo Bock, Google's HR chief at the time, said he \"suggested Page could more easily clear the way for his chosen successor by moving Wojcicki to YouTube.\u201d The announcement of Wojcicki's appointment came as a shock to many Googlers, the book says. Wojcicki had one of the earliest connections to Google -- in 1998, she famously let Page and Brin, who still hold majority shareholder voting power of Google parent company Alphabet, work from her garage when they were starting the company. Her sister, 23andMe founder Anne Wojcicki was married and had kids with Brin. In the book, Bock compared Google to a family enterprise, and the book says Wojcicki often was able to get Page's attention. \u201cWhen people couldn\u2019t get him to see reason, she always could,\u201d said former Google director and early Silicon Valley workplace influencer Kim Scott, who referred to her in the book as \u201ca Larry whisperer.\u201d One example is how Google used search data. \"Wojcicki wanted to use search queries to inform ads people saw on all those banner ads Google ran across the web; if advertisers could target consumers based on searches and on websites, they might spend gobs more with Google,\" the book says. Page had long wanted to keep search data from everything else but Wojcicki \"felt this wasn\u2019t keeping up with trends in the ad industry, which sought ever more data.\u201d \u201cThe founders trust Susan maybe more than anybody on the planet,\" Patrick Keane, an early Google sales director, said in the book. \u201cYou could never get Susan rattled, no matter how challenging the moment was.\u201d YouTube was also discussed as a potential spinout, the book reports. The year after Wojcicki\u2019s appointment, in 2015, Larry Page, announced the creation of Alphabet, a new holding company, that would separate several businesses, including self-driving car Waymo and health sciences unit Verily, from Google. \u201cYouTube seemed like a natural splinter; it already operated with a different name and office,\" the book states. \"Leaders there considered plans to become a separate Alphabet unit, detached from Google. Wojcicki wanted to keep reporting to Page, who had appointed himself Alphabet CEO, rather than his successor at Google, Sundar Pichai. But ultimately it was decided YouTube was too intertwined with Google\u2019s business and machinery to leave. So it stayed at Google.\" Under Wojcicki's watch, YouTube grew to reach more than 81% of U.S. adults and generate nearly $29 billion in revenue in 2021."},

In its Q2 investor letter on July 21, Snap said it would not provide guidance for its current quarter and said \"forward-looking visibility remains incredibly challenging.\" Snap shares dropped more than 25% on the day it reported its second quarter earnings. The company's disappointing results kickstarted a wave of social media companies reporting poor results, citing a weak online advertising market, among other reasons. Facebook-parent Meta also missed analysts' estimates for its second quarter, as did Pinterest. The social media companies blamed some of their problems on businesses cutting back on digital advertising because of the weak economy.

{"url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/29/apple-iphone-14-event-preview-september-2022.html", "title": "Expect Apple to show four new iPhones and an updated Apple Watch next week", "tag": "Tech", "author": "Kif Leswing", "datetime": "2022-08-29 18:11:43", "paragraphs": " Apple is holding a launch event at its headquarters in Cupertino, California, on Sept. 7. The company is expected to announce new iPhone models, as it has every September since 2012. Apple has used prerecorded videos for its launch events since early 2020 thanks partly to Covid restrictions, and this will be the first iPhone launch with an in-person component since 2019. Apple is streaming the launch event online on its website and YouTube in addition to inviting some media to its campus. Apple's hype-filled fall launches are a signature event for Apple. They typically draw millions of simultaneous viewers on YouTube. They garner attention from around the world and set the stage for a holiday marketing blitz during the last three months of the year, which is when Apple's sales are the highest. This year's event has the tagline \"far out,\" which could refer to features such as night-sky photography. Last year, Apple released new iPhones and Apple Watches at an event in September, and then followed it up with an October launch featuring iPads and Macs. Here's what Apple is likely to launch next Wednesday, based on reports. Apple is expected to release four new iPhone models. If Apple's current naming convention holds up, they will be called the iPhone 14. This year Apple will likely discontinue the \"mini\" model with a 4.7-inch screen, according to reports. Instead, Apple could offer two sizes, one with a 6.1-inch screen and one with a 6.7-inch screen, each coming in a standard model and a pricier \"Pro\" model. The Pro models are expected to get more upgrades, according to reports from Bloomberg News, TFI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, and other analysts and Apple watchers. Since 2017, iPhones have included a space at the top of the phone's display with space for Apple's FaceID system, which includes several sensors and a camera. The Pro models could ditch Apple's \"notch\" where it houses the FaceID camera for a slimmer, more streamlined \"pill\" or \"cutout\" approach with a smaller space that has to remain blank, leaving room for an even larger display. The Pro models are also expected to get upgraded A16 processors and cameras. The camera bump is expected to get larger. Apple could release an always-on screen display for showing notifications, like some Android phones have sported for years. Beta iPhone software released over the summer suggested that Apple may be planning a similar feature because of new widgets that show weather and battery life. One of the biggest questions is how Apple will price its iPhones in a period of inflation around the world and macroeconomic uncertainty in some regions. Other consumer electronics, such as Sony's Playstation 5, have seen price cuts. Apple's least-expensive iPhone 13 model is the $699 iPhone 13 Mini, which is expected to be discontinued. That would make Apple's mainline device, which is currently the iPhone 13, the least-expensive new model at $829, if its price doesn't change. Some analysts also expect Apple to increase the price of its Pro models. Apple usually drops the price of older models when it releases new ones, giving more price-sensitive consumers an option. Apple is likely to show the eighth major new version of its watch next week. Last year, the Apple Watch Series 7 got a slightly larger screen, but the redesign did not significantly change the look and feel of the device, which has remained mostly the same since 2014. Expect more evolution this year, too. Apple is considering a body temperature sensor in the new devices, according to the Wall Street Journal, which could help with fertility and sleep tracking. Other sleep tracking features could include the ability to detect advanced sleep patterns or apnea. But the biggest Apple Watch Series 8 announcement could be a new \"Pro\" model with a bigger screen and more durable finish. Apple has previously released Apple Watches with pricey case materials such as gold, ceramic and titanium, and the new \"Pro\" model described by Bloomberg and Kuo could be one of the first high-end Apple Watches to gain additional features over its less-expensive siblings. Also likely: A new updated version of the Apple Watch SE, its $329 entry-level Watch model. IPhone owners who don't plan to buy any new gear this fall will still get an annual update to the iPhones software, iOS 16, which was announced in June and has been in testing over the summer. The software has several new features that users will immediately notice. The biggest banner feature is the ability to customize the iPhone's lock screen with widgets that can display weather forecasts, calendar appointments and other information at a glance. Users can also change the font for the lock screen clock for the first time, as well. IOS 16 also lets you unsend or edit iMessage text messages, as long as you catch them within a few minutes of sending. IOS 16 will also introduce short-term loans from Apple called Apple Pay Later. The feature will allow users to buy stuff online with Apple Pay but pay for the item in four installments without paying interest. One cool feature in iOS 16 is if a user has both an iPhone and a Mac laptop or desktop, they can use the iPhone as a very high-definition web camera. Apple is unlikely to release new iPads next week because their software isn't ready yet. Earlier this month, Apple told TechCrunch that iPadOS, the iPad software, will ship after iOS this fall, suggesting a staggered release. Apple's statement was terse, and the company dislikes talking about unannounced products. But in general, it likes to release new hardware together with new software, so the statement clearly suggested that new iPads would come at a later launch date than iPhones. IPadOS and iOS are very similar, but this year iPadOS is getting a feature called Stage Manager that could allow users to multitask more efficiently \u2014 but also got panned by early testers. Improved iPads could include more powerful processors that are closers to laptop processors, smoother displays and better integration with accessories. Apple also uncharacteristically teased a new \"Mac Pro\" in the spring. The Mac Pro is currently a $5,000 tower of power using an Intel processor. Apple wants to transition its entire Mac lineup away from Intel to its own M-series processors, but a pricey niche product doesn't fit as well with Apple's mass-market iPhones and Apple Watches. Instead, new Macs could be announced at a separate event later this year, as happened last year."},

The company will invest up to $1 billion in the new factory, which it plans to build in the Southeast of the U.S. The newly announced plant will be the panel maker's fourth fully integrated U.S. factory. First Solar also said Tuesday that it will spend $185 million upgrading and expanding its existing facilities in Ohio. CEO Mark Widmar pointed to the IRA as the key catalyst that made the company decide to build another factory in the U.S. rather than looking elsewhere. The funding packages create, for the first time, a \"long-term view and understanding of the industry, and policies aligned to that industry,\" he told CNBC. \"With that level of clarity, we stepped back and evaluated the alternatives or the options of where we could go with our next factory and when we looked at it comprehensively the U.S. was a very attractive option,\" he said. Widmar added that this is the first time the entire supply chain has been incentivized, from the manufacturer to the generating asset and finally to the end customer. \"With that type of alignment, you can create partnerships and opportunities to grow together collectively and more of a win-win type of structure than maybe we had before the implementation of the IRA,\" he said. First Solar said the new factory will manufacture 3.5 gigawatts of solar modules annually by 2025, with the company's Ohio facilities posting cumulative annual production capacity of over 7 GW by 2025. By comparison, the U.S. added 3.9 GW of solar capacity during the first quarter of 2022, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. The country's total solar industry now stands at 126.1 GW, which is enough to power 22 million homes, according to SEIA. Shares of First Solar have surged 65% since the end of July when Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V. announced their surprise agreement on the climate, health care and tax bill. The legislation, which swiftly passed the House and Senate and was signed into law by President Joe Biden, benefits First Solar in several ways, including through the production tax credit for domestic manufacturers. First Solar is the largest U.S.-based developer of solar panels, with a focus on utility-scale panels. The factory announcement comes as First Solar struggles to keep pace with booming demand. During its second quarter earnings call, First Solar said it's sold out through 2025, with a backlog of 44 GW. Widmar said First Solar wants to move quickly when building out its new factory. One of the company's considerations is a site that's as close to shovel-ready as possible. Other factors include the type and availability of workers in the area. First Solar is aiming to have identified the site by the end of the current quarter. \"I think the industry is in the best position it ever has been\u2026for growth beyond any expectations that anyone would have envisioned,\" Widmar said."},

The crash on June 3 i nvolved a Cruise vehicle, which does not require a human driver, braking harshly while making an unprotected left turn as an oncoming vehicle traveling about 40 mph \u2013 15 mph above the speed limit \u2013 switched from a right turn lane to travel through the intersection. In public filings, federal regulators said the recalled software may \"incorrectly predict another vehicle's path or be insufficiently reactive to the sudden path change of a road user.\" Cruise said a software update was conducted to address the problem in July. Following the crash, Cruise said its robotaxi fleet continued to operate but that it temporarily prevented the vehicles from making unprotected left turns. It said it gradually reintroduced unprotected left turns after the software update. The crash was especially notable because it occurred a day after California regulators granted Cruise permission to commercialize its robotaxi fleet. It also happened amid increased scrutiny by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, part of the Department of Transportation, involving such vehicles and advanced driver-assist systems. Commercializing autonomous vehicles has been far more challenging than many predicted even a few years ago. The challenges have led to a consolidation in the autonomous vehicle sector after years of enthusiasm touting the technology as the next multitrillion-dollar market for transportation companies. In June, Cruise became the first company to offer unmanned fared rides to the public in a major city. The company for several years had been testing the vehicles, which are modified Chevrolet Bolt EVs, and was offering limited, non-fared rides to the public before then. The June crash was the only such incident in more than 123,560 driverless unprotected left turns prior to the software update, according to Cruise. The report also noted that law enforcement found the \"party at most fault\" for the collision was the other vehicle, according to the filings. When the crash occurred, the Cruise vehicle \"had to decide between two different risk scenarios and chose the one with the least potential for a serious collision at the time, before the oncoming vehicle's sudden change of direction,\" according to Cruise. In July, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it was investigating the incident, with the assistance of Cruise, a majority-owned subsidiary of GM."},

The agency claims Kochava violated a section of the FTC Act that prohibits unfair deceptive practices in commerce. Using data Kochava collected on mobile devices and combining it with public map programs, the FTC found it was possible to infer the identity of the device owner by linking those devices to sensitive locations and tracing them back to single-family homes. The agency claimed that until at least June of this year, Kochava would grant users access to a sample data set of time-stamped location information from 61 million unique mobile devices, with relatively little effort required by the user seeking access to the data. The FTC claims Kochava was aware of this potential use, marketing its services on the Amazon Web Services Marketplace with the suggestion of using its information \"to map individual devices to households.\" The agency argues in its complaint filed in federal court in Idaho that identification via Kochava's location data \"is likely to injure consumers through exposure to stigma, discrimination, physical violence, emotional distress, and other harms.\" It added that Kochava could have installed reasonable safeguards to protect consumer information, like by blacklisting information associated with sensitive locations so that it would not appear in data sets, such as addiction recovery centers, shelters or medical facilities. \"This lawsuit shows the unfortunate reality that the FTC has a fundamental misunderstanding of Kochava's data marketplace business and other data businesses,\" Kochava Collective General Manager Brian Cox said in a statement. \"Kochava operates consistently and proactively in compliance with all rules and laws, including those specific to privacy.\" Cox said the company announced a new ability to block location data from sensitive locations prior to the FTC's lawsuit. He said the company engaged with the FTC for weeks explaining the data collection process and hoped to come up with \"effective solutions\" with the agency. \"Unfortunately the only outcome the FTC desired was a settlement that had no clear terms or resolutions and redefined the problem into a moving target,\" Cox said. \"Real progress to improve data privacy for consumers will not be reached through flamboyant press releases and frivolous litigation. It's disappointing that the agency continues to circumvent the lawmaking process and perpetuate misinformation surrounding data privacy.\" The FTC voted 4-1 to bring the lawsuit, with Republican Commissioner Noah Joshua Phillips voting against filing the complaint. The commission's other Republican, Christine Wilson, voted with the Democratic majority. The lawsuit builds on the agency's focus on privacy, after announcing earlier this month it is exploring new rules to crack down on commercial surveillance and lax data security.

Facebook, owned by the newly rebranded parent company Meta, has struggled to gain a foothold in the live game streaming market. According to a report from market research firm Streamlabs, in the second quarter of 2022 Facebook Gaming accounted for only 7.9% of the market share for amount of hours watched, behind Twitch (76.7%) and YouTube (15.4%). Facebook isn't the first internet giant to have tried and failed at recreating the Twitch formula. In 2020, Microsoft shuttered its own streaming service, Mixer, after signing a multimillion dollar to have the famous Fortnite player Tyler \"Ninja\" Blevins stream on its service exclusively. YouTube, Twitch's closest competitor, has found more success chipping away at Twitch's dominance.

The Hangzhou, China-headquartered firm bought Quantic Dream, marking the establishment of its first fully owned gaming studio in Europe. NetEase and its rival Tencent have been upping their efforts overseas as the Chinese domestic games market slows down amid tighter regulation. Over the years, Tencent has been prolific in acquisitions and investments in overseas gaming companies. NetEase is now catching up. This year alone, NetEase has set up gaming studios in Japan and the U.S. NetEase has typically been focused on PC and mobile gaming, extremely popular formats in China. Mobile gaming makes up more than half of its global games revenues. But more recently, the tech giant has been expanding into console games. Quantic Dream, a 25-year-old studio, will focus \"on creating and publishing its video games on all platforms, as well as supporting and publishing third-party developed titles,\" according to a press release. That highlights NetEase's intention to grow across mobile, PC and consoles. The acquisition of Quantic Dream is in line with NetEase's strategy of acquiring well-known international characters and franchises. Quantic Dream is currently developing a game called Star Wars Eclipse, based on Disney's space adventure movies. NetEase has already released mobile games based on the Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter. NetEase's international push comes as regulators in China continue to scrutinize the games market, though there are signs of some easing. Last year, authorities restricted the amount of time those under 18 years old could play online games and froze the approval of new titles. In China, games need the green light from regulators to be released and monetized. Those approvals restarted in April. In an interview with CNBC last year, Hu Zhipeng, vice president at NetEase and one of the top bosses of the technology giant's video games business, said that he aims to eventually have 50% of the company's gaming revenue come from overseas, up from around 10% now. Competition in the global games market is heating up. Sony, a leader in console gaming and producer of the PlayStation, announced on Tuesday that it is setting up a dedicated mobile division, which will put it in competition with the likes of Chinese giants Tencent and NetEase."},

The Swedish payments firm generated revenues of 9.1 billion Swedish krona ($950 million) in the period spanning January to the end of June 2022. That was up 24% from a year ago. But the company also racked up hefty losses. Klarna's pre-tax loss soared more than threefold year-on-year to nearly 6.2 billion krona. In the first half of 2021, Klarna lost around 1.8 billion Swedish krona. The company, which allows users to spread the cost of purchases over interest-free installments, saw a jump in operating expenses and defaults. Operating expenses before credit losses came in at 10.8 billion Swedish krona, up from 6.3 billion krona year-over-year, driven by administrative costs related to its rapid international expansion in countries like the U.S. Credit losses, meanwhile, rose more than 50% to 2.9 billion Swedish krona. Klarna had previously been profitable for most of its existence \u2014 that is up until 2019, when the firm dipped into the red for the first time after a hike in investments aimed at growing the business globally. The company's ballooning losses highlight the price of its rapid expansion after the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. Klarna has entered 11 new markets since the start of 2020, and took a number of costly gambits to extend its foothold in the U.S. and Britain. In the U.S., Klarna has spent heavily on marketing and user acquisition in an effort to chip away at Affirm, its main rival stateside. In the U.K., meanwhile, the firm acquired PriceRunner, a price comparison site, in April. It has also engaged in a charm offensive with British politicians and regulators ahead of incoming regulations. More recently, Klarna has been forced to cut back. In May, the company slashed about 10% of its global workforce in a swift round of job cuts. The company subsequently raised raised funds at a $6.7 billion valuation \u2014 an 85% drop from its previous valuation \u2014 in an $800 million investment deal that defined the capitulation from high-growth tech firms as investors grew wary of a possible recession. The sharp discount reflected grim sentiment among investors in fintech in both the public and private markets, with publicly-listed fintech Affirm having lost about three quarters of its market value since the start of 2022. \"We've had to make some tough decisions, ensuring we have the right people, in the right place, focused on business priorities that will accelerate us back to profitability while supporting consumers and retailers through a more difficult economic period,\" said Sebastian Siemiatkowski, CEO and co-founder of Klarna. \"We needed to take immediate and pre-emptive action, which I think was misunderstood at the time, but now sadly we have seen many other companies follow suit.\" Klarna said it plans to tighten its approach to lending, particularly with new customers, to factor in the worsening cost-of-living situation. However, Siemiatkowski said, \"You won't see the impact of this on our financials in this report yet.\" \"We have a very agile balance sheet, especially in comparison to traditional banks due to the short-term nature of our products, but even for Klarna it takes a little while for the impact of decisions to flow through.\" Fintech companies are cutting expenses and delaying listing plans amid a worsening macroeconomic backdrop. Meanwhile, consumer-oriented services are losing their appeal among investors while so-called \"business-to-business\" fintechs attract the limelight. Klarna says it is now used by over 150 million people, while the company counts 450,000 merchants on its network. Klarna mainly generates income from retailers, not users, taking a small slice of each transaction processed through its platform. \"Ultimately they've proven there can be a profitable business there but have doubled down on growing in the U.S. market which is expensive,\" Simon Taylor, head of strategy at fintech startup Sardine.ai, told CNBC. \"Market share there will be meaningful for long-term revenue. But it takes time and the funding taps aren't what they used to be.\" But the company faces stiff competition, with titans in the realms of both tech and finance seeking to capitalize on growth in the buy now, pay later industry. Apple is set to launch its own BNPL product, Apple Pay Later, this fall, which will allow users to split the cost of their purchases over four equal monthly payments. Meanwhile, proposals are afoot to bring the BNPL market under regulatory supervision. In the U.K., the government has announced plans to enforce tighter affordability checks and a crackdown on misleading advertisements. Stateside, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau opened a market-monitoring probe into BNPL companies."},

Twitter shares were down more than 1% in premarket trade. The latest filings come after Twitter's former head of security, Peiter \"Mudge\" Zatko, earlier this month alleged\"extreme, egregious deficiencies\" by the social media company related to privacy, security and content moderation. On July 8, Musk 's legal team initially filed a notice with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to terminate the Twitter acquisition. Musk's team alleged that \"Twitter has not complied with its contractual obligations.\" The follow-up notice, disclosed to the SEC, cites allegations made by Zatko as additional reasons to terminate the deal. \"Allegations regarding certain facts, known to Twitter prior to and as of July 8, 2022, but undisclosed to the Musk Parties prior to and at that time, have since come to light that provide additional and distinct bases to terminate the Merger Agreement,\" Mike Ringler, Musk's legal representative from Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, wrote in a letter to Twitter's legal chief, Vijaya Gadde. Ringler said in the letter that the latest termination notice is \"not legally necessary\" to end the merger deal, but is being delivered in case the July 8 filing is \"determined to be invalid for any reason.\" The letter on behalf of Musk said the Zatko complaint \"alleges far-reaching misconduct at Twitter\u2014all of which was disclosed to Twitter's directors and senior executives, including (CEO) Parag Agrawal\u2014that is likely to have severe consequences for Twitter's business.\" Musk's lawyer said Zatko alleges that Twitter is in \"material noncompliance\" with its obligations under its 2011 agreement with the Federal Trade Commission. The letter laid out some of Zatko's other allegations including claims that Twitter is \"uniquely vulnerable to systemic disruption resulting from data center failures or malicious actors,\" something senior management knew about but \"ignored and sought to obfuscate.\" \"These allegations, if true, demonstrate that Twitter has breached the following provisions of the Merger Agreement, thereby giving the Musk Parties the right to terminate the Merger Agreement pursuant to its terms,\" the letter said. Twitter's legal team responded on Tuesday by sending a letter to Musk's legal representatives. Twitter said Musk's termination case is \"invalid and wrongful under\" the acquisition agreement. \"It is based solely on statements made by a third party that, as Twitter has previously stated, are riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies and lack important context,\" the letter written by William Savitt of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz law firm said. \"Contrary to the assertions in your letter, Twitter has breached none of its representations or obligations under the Agreement, and Twitter has not suffered and is not likely to suffer a Company Material Adverse Effect.\" Twitter said it intends to enforce the acquisition agreement and \"close the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon\" with Musk. Twitter's legal team said Musk's latest notice to terminate the deal is \"invalid for the independent reason that Mr. Musk and the other Musk Parties continue to knowingly, intentionally, willfully, and materially breach\" the acquisition agreement. The social media giant has previously responded to Zatko. In a memo to staff posted to Twitter on Aug. 23 by CNN correspondent Donie O'Sullivan, Agrawal described Zatko as \"a former Twitter executive who was terminated in January 2022 for ineffective leadership and poor performance.\" Zatko's attorneys issued a statement on Monday in response to that characterization, saying he \"put his career on the line because of his concerns about Twitter users, the public, and the company's shareholders.\" Twitter and Musk will go on trial on Oct. 17 in Delaware to resolve Musk's attempt to cancel his acquisition of the company unless they reach a settlement first. Since proposing the Twitter takeover, Musk has complained that the number of fake or spam accounts on the social media platform is higher than is being disclosed. In the July 8 letter, Musk's legal team claimed the company had \"failed or refused to provide\" information on these accounts to the Tesla CEO. Ahead of the October trial, Musk's legal team has subpoenaed Zatko, seeking information on the company's spam accounts and its alleged security vulnerabilities. \u2014 CNBC's Lora Kolodny contributed to this report."},

In a series of letters sent Tuesday morning, the committee asked four agencies, including the Department of the Treasury, the Federal Trade Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as five digital asset exchanges \u2014 Coinbase, FTX, Binance.US, Kraken, and KuCoin \u2014 for information and documents about what they are doing, if anything, to safeguard consumers against scams and combat cryptocurrency-related fraud. More than $1 billion in crypto has been lost to fraud since the start of 2021, according to research from the FTC. \"As stories of skyrocketing prices and overnight riches have attracted both professional and amateur investors to cryptocurrencies, scammers have cashed in,\" wrote Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D.-Ill., Chair of the Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy. \"The lack of a central authority to flag suspicious transactions in many situations, the irreversibility of transactions, and the limited understanding many consumers and investors have of the underlying technology make cryptocurrency a preferred transaction method for scammers.\" The letters ask that the federal agencies and crypto exchanges respond by Sept. 12 with information about what they are doing to protect consumers. The committee says that these responses could be used to craft legislative solutions. In particular, the letters ask that the exchanges produce documents dating back through Jan. 1, 2009, which display efforts to combat crypto scams and fraud, as well as show attempts made to \"identify, investigate, and remove or flag potentially fraudulent digital assets or accounts,\" as well as highlight discussions around \"whether to adopt more stringent policies.\" In one letter, addressed to Sam Bankman-Fried, the CEO and founder of FTX, the committee notes that \"while some exchanges review cryptocurrencies before listing them, others allow digital assets to be listed with little or no vetting.\" Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis found that 37% of crypto scam revenue last year went to \"rug pulls,\" a type of scheme that involves developers listing a token on an exchange, pumping it up, and then vanishing with the funds. Binance.US, which also received an inquiry from the committee on Tuesday, has been accused in a class action lawsuit of misleading consumers about the safety of investing in the U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin known as terraUSD (or UST, for short) and its sister token, luna. At their height, luna and UST had a combined market value of almost $60 billion. Now, they're essentially worthless. Concern over the safety of crypto funds parked on centralized platforms has also been gaining traction following the recent collapse of Voyager Digital and Celsius, both popular apps among retail traders because of the double-digit annual percentage yield once offered by the two companies. The subsequent bankruptcies of these two platforms have highlighted the question of who owns cryptocurrency assets when a custodial business goes belly up. In the bankruptcy proceedings of both Voyager and Celsius, customers are considered unsecured creditors, rather than federally-insured bank depositors, meaning there is no guarantee they will get any of their money back. As for the relationship between investor and crypto exchange, the terms and conditions vary. In a financial filing released in May, Coinbase said its users would be treated as \"general unsecured creditors\" in the event of bankruptcy. Krishnamoorthi also noted that the agencies often seem to be acting at cross-purposes and giving inconsistent guidance to private-sector players. \"Without clear definitions and guidance, agencies will continue their infighting and will be unable effectively to implement consumer and investor protections related to cryptocurrencies and the exchanges on which they are traded.\""},

In a filing with the SEC, Nvidia said the U.S. government told the company on Aug. 26, about a new license requirement for future exports to China, including Hong Kong, to reduce the risk that the products may be used by the Chinese military. Nvidia said the restriction would affect the A100 and H100 products, which are graphics processing units sold to businesses. \"The license requirement also includes any future Nvidia integrated circuit achieving both peak performance and chip-to-chip I/O performance equal to or greater than thresholds that are roughly equivalent to the A100, as well as any system that includes those circuits,\" the filing said. The company expects that it could lose $400 million in potential sales in China in the current quarter after previously forecasting revenue of $5.9 billion. The new rule also applies to sales to Russia, but Nvidia said it doesn't have paying customers there. In recent years, the U.S. government has applied increasing export restrictions to chips made with U.S. technology because of fears that Chinese companies could use them for military purposes or steal trade secrets. Nvidia said it was applying for a license to continue some Chinese exports but doesn't know whether the U.S. government will grant an exemption. \"We are working with our customers in China to satisfy their planned or future purchases with alternative products and may seek licenses where replacements aren't sufficient,\" an Nvidia spokesperson told CNBC. \"The only current products that the new licensing requirement applies to are A100, H100 and systems such as DGX that include them.\" An AMD representative confirmed to CNBC that it had also received new licensing requirements from the U.S. Department of Commerce which it believed applied to its MI250 circuit, which is intended for artificial intellegence.

One of the enduring lessons of the iPhone era is that Steve Jobs led with what the consumer didn't know they wanted until he showed it to them. Robotics pioneer Rodney Brooks has operated from a similar idea \u2014 with varying degrees of success. His robot vacuum cleaner Roomba, and its parent company iRobot, which more or less made the category of robotic vacuums an inexpensive, must-have for many consumers, was recently sold to Amazon for $1.7 billion. \"iRobot found a product-market fit. It had a feature set and a cost that lots and lots of people were willing to pay for, that puck-shaped thing that cleans the floor pretty well,\" said Matt Beane, an assistant professor in the technology management program at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and a robotics expert. But another of Brooks' big, early ideas, hasn't worked out the way he or the world imagined. Rethink Robotics was founded in 2008 with the idea that a cobot \u2014 a robot working alongside humans in ways that traditional automation couldn't (i.e. with much less danger to the human), and without the fencing that most industrial robots remained inside \u2014 was a market waiting to be made among industrial customers. But for all the novel ideas that Brooks and his Rethink colleagues brought to the table, its first cobot never caught on. It caught on in the press, for sure, and if you were following tech news at the beginning of the last decade you likely saw Baxter and \"his eyes\" staring out from the screen between his arms at some point in a photo or video footage. At CNBC, we learned firsthand the limitations of working with novel industrial robots when we invited Baxter on-air for a live segment as part of Rethink being named to the inaugural Disruptor 50 list in 2013. For technical reasons, it would have been a lot more difficult than we imagined to get Baxter onto the television studio set. While he may not be a part of the robotic future anymore, there is no history of the cobot that can be written without Baxter. \"There is no such thing as the cobot without Rod Brooks,\" Beane said. \"Rethink started the industry.\" After a lot of early fanfare, reality set in for Rethink. By 2018, it was struggling to scale its operations and find enough buyers for Baxter, with its two-armed design proving to be a novel idea, but a mistake. \"No one needs a two-armed robot,\" Beane said, describing that design decision as \"humans projecting onto a robot their own physical form.\" Rethink pivoted, in what turned out to be a move made too late, to a one-armed robot named Sawyer. But the technology had other problems. Rethink bet on an approach that used elastic actuators \u2014 a technology one of Brooks co-founders was an expert on \u2014 which allowed the robot to perform \"force sensing,\" an approach the company backed because it would make the robots safer around human coworkers. Rethink's design would also make the robots low cost, getting rid of standard industry reliance on motors and related parts. Paul Maeder, a mechanical engineer who invested early in Rethink through his VC firm, told the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in a post-mortem on Rethink that goes deep into the technical shortcomings, that cheaper parts plus force sensing seemed like the way to bring down pricing in the robotics market and appeal to customers. And it did bring down pricing. \"The reality is that they had a very low price point, shockingly low,\" Beane said. \"They had done an amazingly good job at materials sourcing and design, and they were headed to one-third or one-quarter of the price for other robots.\" But Rethink never achieved the market penetration or scale it needed to maintain its operations. As the financials worsened, Rethink became the acquisition target of a Chinese firm, a deal Beane says would have had a good shot at getting the firm to scale. But that deal was scuttled \"at the last moment,\" according to the company, and a 2018 bankruptcy followed. Rethink was bought out of bankruptcy by German automation company Hahn Group, which is still trying to make the technology a success today. In a statement provided to TechCrunch at the time of its demise, Rethink said, \"We were early to market with a very innovative product that was ahead of its time, and unfortunately, we did not achieve the commercial success we had expected.\" It's true Rethink had no shortage of interesting, innovative ideas, even if they weren't the right ones for the market. According to Beane, one of the most intriguing was the ability for the cobot to be programmed by the worker. \"People don't make much of this feature anymore, but that was a graphic user interface system which didn't require code and you could teach it, train it to do a job as the worker,\" Beane said. \"But no manager would turn those features on,\" he added. That's an idea that Brooks is still working on today, through his latest robotics startup Robust.ai, co-founded with cognitive scientist Gary Marcus, which is making a warehouse cobot, Carter, that is like a mobile shopping cart providing transport within fulfillment centers. \"It can drive in any direction and is worker programmable and can physically collaborate,\" Beane said. \"A lot of the same DNA is there.\" Once Sawyer became the lead cobot, Rethink invested in a technology that integrated the cobot with preexisting industrial automation, an interesting approach, but ultimately, another bottleneck that was costly in engineering time to connect and to get to communicate with machinery like conveyors. \"Just to alter the speed of a conveyor is extremely expensive,\" Beane said. The DNA that has become standard in the cobot market that Baxter, and later Sawyer, hoped to dominate, is from Rethink rival and Denmark-based Universal Robots. While its cobots may be \"very boring looking\" in Beane's view, they were what the market ultimately wanted. \"In the end, the series elastic actuators were probably not the best idea in the world,\" Maeder told ASME. \"What customers really want is a low-cost, simple, fast, repeatable robot. They want to put something in this exact location again, and again and again. In the end, that was a lot more complicated for us to achieve than for some of our competitors because they weren't trying to do force sensing.\" Even the two arms that Baxter had could always be purchased by a buyer if they really wanted that approach, by purchasing two single-arm robots, and that's what Universal Robots \u2014 which was acquired by industrial automation company Teradyne in 2015 \u2014 excels at, with its UR3, UR5 and UR7 cobots leading to increased sales, and successive generations of its cobot line continuing to hit the market. The opportunity for robotics technology remains significant, though it is still trailing other automation approaches in market penetration. Robot sales in the North American market have been growing, and the Teradyne unit led by Universal Robots is seeing steady, if not explosive, sales growth, too. Revenue was $300 million in 2019, and then increased to $376 million last year after a Covid dip. According to Wall Street estimates, sales could reach $440 million this year, or about 18% growth. That growth rate is higher than the percentage of overall revenue it represents, which is still under 15%. \"A lot more will occur,\" Beane said. \"Progress often looks slow up close ... but the utility of a robotic system that can accomplish general tasks at a reasonable cost is extraordinary, billions, maybe trillions worth of value,\" he added. And costs keep going down, from batteries to sensors and software, meaning the price performance for robots keeps going up steadily. But where the cobot finds its greatest utility remains an open question. While the industrial world use has been in the first decades often as much a marketing ploy or, at best, an experiment rather than proof of widespread adoption, there is reason to forecast multiple roles for cobots based on an aging demographic. \"Anyone who says not in my lifetime, you better hope it is in your lifetime, because you will need help,\" Beane said. He anticipates that jobs outside of the manufacturing sector with which cobots have been associated \u2014 from warehousing to retail, medical (think cobots bringing supplies to nurses) and retirement communities \u2014 are areas poised for growing use. \"Manufacturing is about high throughput and high consistency and you can automate the heck out of it without a cobot,\" Beane said. \"We're only just getting started on this capability being useful and used at scale.\" Rodney Brooks is among the robotics experts who has spoken about a world that is getting older and a working population that is not as strong. He wrote in a blog post covering his annual predictions that \"soon the houses of the elderly will be cluttered with too many robots.\" Wall Street analysts are focused on the opportunity presented by a chronic labor shortage, and related changes taking place in a global outsourcing paradigm which economies including the U.S. have been relying on for decades. With \"near shoring\" and onshoring of more manufacturing activity, there is increasing demand for labor in a tight labor market. One answer is automation, and technology like Universal Robots is relatively easy to program and implement. But one big issue the cobots have not yet solved is the same one that started Brooks down the Rethink path: figuring out what everyone wants from this technology, the \"killer app,\" so to speak, for the cobot. Universal Robots has many different applications for its technology, but not a single one that drives strong demand within one very high volume market. That's a solvable problem, but still a work in progress. Robots running popcorn stations in a movie theatre or robot cafe baristas aren't the career opportunity that takes the cobots to center stage in the economy. But there is a shortage of people and automation has to be one of the solutions, even if it doesn't happen by tomorrow. We have not reached a world of genuine physical collaboration between human worker and cobot, Beane says, \"the kind of stuff where humans reach over to grab the next thing and the robot sees I am reaching and hands it to me and we might even brush up against each other,\" but, \"We are getting there,\" he added. The automated systems that are most widely deployed remain the ones that are more dangerous and kept at a distance. But Beane thinks that Rethink came closer to solving the problem than it is given credit for, and has yet to prove in its new life under Hahn. Hahn did not respond to a request for comment by press time. \"Another eight months and maybe they might have gotten product-market fit. It was inexpensive and reliable. I really do believe we could have seen an iPhone moment,\" Beane said. In his personal blog, Brooks summed up the Rethink story this way: \"Baxter and Sawyer were the first safe robots that did not require a cage to keep humans away from them for the humans' protection. And Sawyer was the first modern industrial robot which finally got away from having a computer-like language to control it, as all robots had since the idea was first developed at the Stanford AI Lab back in the very early seventies. There is still a lot remaining to be done.\""},

Speaking to CNBC's \" Street Signs Asia\" on Wednesday, Sanjay Kapoor, who is now an independent analyst, said Indian mobile operator Reliance Jio's $25 billion plan to launch 5G network across the country indicates that India is \"very serious\" about 5G. 5G refers to the fifth generation of high-speed mobile internet which offers super-fast download speeds and more bandwidth that's capable of supporting technologies like driverless cars and virtual reality applications, including the metaverse. According to Reuters, Reliance is making a push to roll out its network within two months. It is also developing an affordable 5G smartphone with Google, according to the report. \"But when you look at what's happening \u2026 [in] China, for example, a single operator puts in more than $15 [billion], $16 billion every year, and they've been doing it for the last couple of years,\" said Kapoor. \"From an international perspective, [$25 billion] seems pretty okay. But in India, it looks really colossal.\" In July, India kicked off its 5G auction ahead of a planned 2023 rollout. Bidders include three of the country's major mobile operators in India \u2014 Reliance Jio, the market leader, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea \u2014 as well as Indian billionaire Gautam Adani's Adani Enterprises. Kapoor said the battle for the 72 gigahertz of 5G spectrum will be a \"two-horse race\" between Reliance and Bharti Airtel. \"They will be neck-to-neck [and] the strategies might differ,\" he added. Reliance Industries' Jio deposited 140 billion rupees of earnest money with the Indian government in July \u2014 it was the largest sum among the contenders. The amount of earnest money deposited is an indication of the amount of spectrum a company wishes to buy. Bharti Airtel deposited 55 billion rupees, while Vodafone Idea put in an earnest money deposit of 22 billion rupees. Reliance may have had a first-mover's advantage with its recent announcement, but Bharti Airtel's postpaid customer base could give it an edge over its rival, Kapoor said. However, what customers really value is their experience with a service provider, he pointed out. \"Therefore, each one of them will have to strive for supremacy in the market to make sure that they have a positive customer experience and are able to be competitive and world-class.\" But India's 5G infrastructure still has some way to go before that can happen, according to Kapoor. \"To give a sizable rollout in a country as large as India, it's not going to be very easy,\" he said. \"Do we have completely fiberized sites? China, for example, has a million sites already \u2026 and we [have] roughly, to each operator, about 250,000 sites.\" He added that India is going to need \"a lot more\" fiberized sites before it can give coverage to every nook and corner. Fibre infrastructure is the backbone of ultra-fast 5G networks, where a large availability of fiber-optic cables are required. \"To the time when we really can boast about giving a great customer experience, I think we are two, three years away,\" Kapoor said."},

Some 220 solar panels and other equipment at the facility, known as FAT1, were damaged by the three-alarm fire, which was caused by \"an undetermined electrical event within the solar system mounted on top of the roof,\" Leland Wilding, Fresno's fire investigator, wrote in an incident report. A little over a year later, about 60 firefighters were called to an even larger Amazon facility in Perryville, Maryland, to put out a two-alarm blaze, local news outlets reported. In the intervening months, at least four other Amazon fulfillment centers caught fire or experienced electrical explosions due to failures with their solar energy-generating systems, according to internal company documents viewed by CNBC. The documents, which have never been made public, indicate that between April 2020 and June 2021, Amazon experienced \"critical fire or arc flash events\" in at least six of its 47 North American sites with solar installations, effecting 12.7% of such facilities. Arc flashes are a kind of electrical explosion. \"The rate of dangerous incidents is unacceptable, and above industry averages,\" an Amazon employee wrote in one of the internal reports. The solar snafus underscore the challenge Amazon and many other large corporations face in their quest to shrink their environmental footprint and reduce reliance on fossil fuels. Amazon has been among the most aggressive. In 2019, founder Jeff Bezos launched the Climate Pledge, promising the largest online retailer would zero out emissions by 2040, embrace renewable energy and move away from gas-guzzling delivery vans, including through a billion-dollar-plus investment in electric vehicle company Rivian. Corporate America is under pressure from regulators and a growing subset of investors to set and report on environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals. Many will be able to reap financial rewards for renewable energy efforts after Congress in August passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which includes climate provisions projected to reduce the country's carbon emissions by roughly 40% by 2030. Commercial solar in the U.S. is expected to see 8% annual growth over the next five years, thanks in part to the legislation, according to Wood Mackenzie solar analyst Michelle Davis. Warehouses can take outsized advantage of solar, she said, because they have large roofs and the systems can power all the HVAC, refrigeration and other energy-heavy systems located inside. But costly and dangerous issues can arise. By June of last year, all of Amazon's U.S. operations with solar had to be taken offline temporarily, internal documents show. The company had to ensure its systems were designed, installed and maintained properly before \"re-energizing\" any of them. Amazon spokesperson Erika Howard told CNBC in a statement that the incidents involved systems run by partners, and that the company responded by voluntarily turning off its solar-powered roofs. \"Out of an abundance of caution, following a small number of isolated incidents with onsite solar systems owned and operated by third parties, Amazon proactively powered off our onsite solar installations in North America, and took immediate steps to re-inspect each installation by a leading solar technical expert firm,\" the statement said. Those details didn't show up in Amazon's 100-page sustainability report for 2021, which was published at the beginning of August. In that report, available to the public via Amazon's sustainability website, the company said rooftop solar was powering 115 of its fulfillment centers across the globe by the end of 2021, up from more than 90 in the middle of the year. The majority of those are outside the U.S. \"Many of our fulfillment facilities throughout the U.S., Europe, and India are powered by on-site solar, where a rooftop installation can power up to 80% of the facility's energy use,\" the report said. By April of this year, Amazon had onsite solar at 176 facilities, according to its website. The solar program was launched in 2017. \"As inspections are completed, our onsite solar systems are being powered back on,\" Howard said. \"Amazon also built a team of dedicated solar experts overseeing the construction, operations, and maintenance of our systems in-house to ensure the safety of our systems.\" Excluded from the public sustainability report is any mention of the expenses Amazon incurs when there's a failure. An Amazon employee estimated, in the documents circulated internally, that each incident cost the company an average of $2.7 million. Costs included third-party audits of rooftop solar systems, checks on how much electricity they were generating and repairs for any broken or faulty parts of the systems that inspectors identified. The Amazon employee also said the company would lose $940,000 per month, or $20,000 for each of the 47 decommissioned North American sites, as long as the solar remained offline. There could be additional costs for Amazon depending on contracts with clean energy partners for renewable energy credits, the documents show. To date, Amazon has contracted with third-party vendors to design, then install solar photovoltaic systems on rooftops and big backup batteries on site. Other major retailers, including Walmart and Target, have also installed solar rooftops and adopted programs to trim their energy bills and reach sustainability goals. In addition to its warehouses, Amazon has some solar roof systems at its Whole Foods stores. Amazon and its auditor, Clean Energy Associates (CEA), put off inspection of the solar rooftop systems at Whole Foods locations until 2022, the documents said. As of late 2021, four years after acquiring Whole Foods, Amazon was still working to attain technical information about the renewable energy assets at the stores. To maintain tighter quality control of its solar energy systems, some Amazon employees recommended bringing more operations in-house. The fire in Perryville, Maryland, which was the sixth failure in a little over a year, spurred the company to take systematic action. On June 17, 2021, roughly a week after the fire at the warehouse known as MDT2, Amazon's sustainability division directed the owners and developers of solar rooftop systems on its U.S. warehouses to decommission them. The solar rooftops would no longer be generating electricity from the sun or producing renewable energy credits. Amazon then hired Denver-based CEA to conduct a third-party audit of its rooftop solar systems in the U.S., Asia-Pacific and Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Late last year, while CEA was still conducting its inspections, it informed Amazon of one critical and 259 major findings across Amazon's rooftop solar portfolio. Problems included mismatched module-to-module connectors, improper installation of connectors, poor wire management and evidence of water intrusion in the inverters, internal documents said. Issues with inverters, which convert solar energy into usable electricity, were identified as the likely cause of a fire in at least one Amazon warehouse. Wilding, the Fresno fire inspector, concluded the blaze at FAT1 \"originated on or near two inverters,\" according to an investigation report obtained by CNBC through a request for public records. Amazon blamed third-party partners and vendors for the most significant problems uncovered by CEA and other teams working on facilities and sustainability initiatives. \"Over the past five years, solar malfunctions have been caused by improper installation techniques, improper commissioning of a new system, inadequate system maintenance and equipment malfunction,\" the documents said. Amazon teams working on facilities and sustainability initiatives devised a two-part plan to help prevent future breakdowns in the rooftop solar program. In late 2021, the divisions requested $3.6 million in funding to reinspect sites where major findings were identified in order to ensure the systems were safe to be brought back online, according to internal correspondence. Internal teams also began to urge Amazon leadership to rely more on salaried employees and less on outside vendors. Over time, the company hired more solar experts focused on procurement, design, construction and maintenance globally. In some cases, management was notably slow in responding. For example, the groups inside the company agitating for change went to leadership for approval on the hiring, re-inspection and re-energizing plans. But the efforts were held up for months by top Amazon executives, including Kara Hurst, vice president of worldwide sustainability, and Alicia Boler-Davis, senior vice president of global customer fulfillment, who left the company in June 2022, according to internal correspondence viewed by CNBC. Job openings suggest Amazon is still seeking to hire people internally for solar operations. The company was recently looking for someone to manage sustainability projects across its North American facilities, which include rooftop solar. There's a current listing for a technical program partner on the solar team says that a key aspect of the position is collaborating with \"internal partners\" in worldwide design, solar construction and sustainability, among other divisions. As it tries to staff up, Amazon has acknowledged that going green comes with hurdles, particularly for a company \"of the size and broad scope of Amazon.\" \"But at Amazon, we don't shy away from big challenges,\" Hurst wrote, in the letter kicking off the 2021 sustainability report. \"We don't have all the answers today, but we believe in the need to act now.\" WATCH: How two friends formed Amazon's first U.S. union and what's next"},

The lawsuit also names MicroStrategy as a defendant. Racine alleges the company conspired to help Saylor evade the taxes. The AG's office said it's seeking to recover a total sum of over $100 million in unpaid taxes and penalties. Shares of MicroStrategy were down more than 6% Wednesday afternoon on the news. Saylor, who oversaw the company's push into bitcoin, stepped down as CEO earlier this month. Under his leadership, MicroStrategy spent close to $4 billion acquiring bitcoin at an average price of $30,700, and he has said he considers the company's stock a sort of bitcoin ETF. Saylor allegedly claimed to reside in Virginia or Florida, which have lower or no personal income tax rates, while actually living in several different homes around D.C., including a penthouse apartment in the Georgetown neighborhood or on his yacht on the Georgetown waterfront or Potomac River when the apartment was undergoing renovations, according to the lawsuit. The suit includes several screenshots of posts that appear to be from Saylor's Facebook page dating back several years and referencing the view from his \"Georgetown balcony\" and discussing his \"home\" while tagging Washington, D.C. MicroStrategy allegedly \"had detailed information confirming that Saylor was in fact a DC resident,\" according to a press release, but it chose to withhold that information. In a statement, MicroStrategy said, \"The case is a personal tax matter involving Mr. Saylor. The Company was not responsible for his day-to-day affairs and did not oversee his individual tax responsibilities. Nor did the Company conspire with Mr. Saylor in the discharge of his personal tax responsibilities. The District of Columbia's claims against the Company are false and we will defend aggressively against this overreach.\" Around 2014, the AG's office claims in the lawsuit, MicroStrategy's then-chief financial officer confronted Saylor about his alleged tax evasion being a potential liability for the company. Saylor and MicroStrategy ended up reaching an agreement where Saylor's salary would be reduced to a nominal $1, the lawsuit claims, in order to reduce the risk authorities would discover the alleged scheme. Still, the AG alleges, Saylor continued to benefit from \"fringe benefits\" with a \"high cash value,\" such as use of the company plane. \"A decade ago, I bought an historic house in Miami Beach and moved my home there from Virginia,\" Saylor said in a statement. \"Although MicroStrategy is based in Virginia, Florida is where I live, vote, and have reported for jury duty, and it is at the center of my personal and family life. I respectfully disagree with the position of the District of Columbia, and look forward to a fair resolution in the courts.\" The suit is the first to be brought under a recently passed law called the False Claims Act, according to Racine's office. The district law incentivizes whistleblowers to report tax fraud and allows the court to impose penalties up to three times the amount of the evaded taxes, according to the AG's office. The district suit follows a separate complaint filed by whistleblowers against Saylor in April 2021, accusing him of failing to pay income taxes from 2014 through 2020. The complaint was filed under seal but made public on Wednesday. The AG's office said it independently investigated the whistleblower case and found MicroStrategy had filed inaccurate W-2s with his Florida-based address and had failed to withhold taxes allegedly owed to the district. The new lawsuit alleges Saylor failed to pay income tax he owed to the district starting in 2005. \u2014 MacKenzie Sigalos contributed to this story.

But a new study suggests it may not be worth the time \u2014 at least in some places. The travel insurance comparison site InsureMyTrip compared rates for 950 hotels in 19 global cities on three popular booking websites as well as each hotel's site. According to the results published last week, Hotels.com had the best overall rates \u2014 but just barely. Hotels.com had the best rates in 620 instances, which was slightly higher than Expedia, which had the cheapest rates in 579 instances. Booking directly with a hotel was more expensive, but by only about $6 more on average, according to the study. \"There have been conflicting views on hotel rates, and people ... believe that booking through online travel platforms ensured a better rate than the hotel website,\" said Shalabh Arora, director of marketing at India's Four Seasons Hotel Bengaluru. \"However, it's not so at Four Seasons where rate parity is taken very seriously.\" He said the hotels' website has a pop-up function which compares rates offered by the hotel with those on other booking platforms. Finally, the website Booking.com had the cheapest rates in 72 instances \u2014 or about 7% of the time \u2014 according to the study. \"Not only was [Booking.com] rarely the most affordable, but it was also the most expensive option the majority of the time,\" according to the published results. The company's Managing Director for Asia Pacific Laura Houldsworth responded to the study by email, stating that the company aims \"to always be transparent with our customers\" and that \"our property partners are free to set their own prices on Booking.com.\" She added that \"our promise to price match also means that if a customer should ever find a lower price on another website, Booking.com will refund the difference.\" The report found average hotel rates on Hotels.com and Expedia were the same in seven of 19 cities, with overall averages varying by just 27 cents. \"Expedia and Hotels.com often had the same price, especially with the international hotels,\" said Sarah Webber, director of marketing for InsureMyTrip. Both brands are owned by Expedia Group, which also operates other travel booking websites, including Travelocity, Hotwire, Orbitz and CheapTickets. \"Hotels working with Expedia Group distribute their rates across all of our brands,\" said Anna Brown, a company public relations manager. \"The rate is similar across brands, however various offers ... approved by our hotel partners, sometimes create rate differences.\" Brown said rates can also vary through brands' app-only pricing, while Hotwire's \"Hot Rates\" mask hotels' names prior to purchase in exchange for deep discounts on last-minute bookings. Booking.com is part of Booking Holdings, which operates Priceline, Agoda and Kayak. Booking Holdings had the highest revenue among all online travel agencies from 2019 to 2021, according to the research company Statista. The InsureMyTrip report showed significant rate differences in certain cities. For instance, travelers could save as much as $88 per night in Honolulu, if they found the lowest price. In New York, the report found average hotel rates varied from $293 on Hotels.com to $367 on Booking.com. The study also found: But rate fluctuations were less pronounced outside of the United States. Posted rates varied less than $10 per night on average in Hong Kong, Bangkok, Macau, Kuala Lumpur and Istanbul, according to the research. InsureMyTrip's study represents a snapshot in time, with the research analyzing rates for a double room for two people booked for the night of Aug. 27, 2022, the firm said. All searches were conducted on the same day to avoid price fluctuations, since \"prices can change quickly and without warning,\" said Webber. However, the study did not consider whether rates were refundable or included taxes, said Webber. \"To keep the study as simple as possible, we took the price seen on the sites as the final cost,\" she said. \"So, it's definitely something to consider as not all hotels or booking sites include the same extras in the final price.\" Other factors, such as prepayment requirements and breakfast inclusions, can affect rates too, which further complicates the hotel price comparison process \u2014 for researchers and travelers alike."},

CEO Evan Spiegel announced the moves in a memo Tuesday, and told employees the company needs to restructure its business to deal with its financial challenges. He said the company's current year-over-year revenue growth rate for the quarter of 8% \"is well below what we were expecting earlier this year.\" \"While we have built substantial capital reserves, and have made extensive efforts to avoid reductions in the size of our team by reducing spend in other areas, we must now face the consequences of our lower revenue growth and adapt to the market environment,\" Spiegel said. \"We are restructuring our business to increase focus on our three strategic priorities: community growth, revenue growth, and augmented reality.\" Other projects the company nuked include its Snap Minis third-party apps and Snap Games. Spiegel said Snap is also starting the \"process of winding down\" its Zenly map product and Voisey music feature, which were both inherited through acquisitions. Snap has also promoted Jerry Hunter from senior vice president of engineering to chief operating officer. Hunter will continue leading Snap's engineering unit, Spiegel said. The company said it hired Ronan Harris, Google's vice president and managing director of U.K. and Ireland, to be its president of the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, a new position. Harris will join Snap's executive team. Spiegel said Snap is currently searching for presidents of the company's Asia-Pacific and Americas regions, also two new roles. \"Changes of this magnitude are never easy, and we must act decisively to meet this moment as a team,\" Spiegel said. \"I am proud of the strength and resilience of our team as we have navigated the myriad challenges of growing our business in a highly competitive industry during uncertain and unprecedented times.\" In July, Snap shares cratered more than 25% after the company reported second-quarter results that missed on both the top and bottom lines and said it would not provide guidance for its current quarter. The company said at the time that it planned to \"substantially\" slow its hiring rate and operating expense growth rate. Like other social media companies, including Facebook parent Meta, Pinterest and Twitter, Snap said a confluence of factors has simultaneously hurt the company's business. They include a weakening macroeconomic environment and Apple 's 2021 iOS update, which made it more difficult for social media companies to track users on behalf of third-party advertisers. The rise of TikTok's short-video service has also posed a significant challenge for Snap and its competitors. Snap said it was scrapping development of its Pixy drone after reports surfaced that the company was pausing its work on the device. The drone was supposed to be a fun way for users to take photos of themselves from multiple angles.

Those investments come just as Emirates posted a $1.1 billion loss for the year ended March 31. \"While others respond to industry pressures with cost cuts, Emirates is flying against the grain and investing to deliver ever better experiences to our customers,\" said the president of Emirates airline, Tim Clark. Emirates is not the only airline pulling out all the stops to ride the tailwinds of \"revenge travel\" \u2014 the idea that people are making up for time \"lost\" during the pandemic to travel again. Earlier this year, Finnair launched a new line of premium economy cabins, featuring seats that provide around 50% more space than their economy seats. Air France, likewise, announced new long-haul business seats in May, complete with sliding dividers for passengers who want their own private space.\nEmirates told CNBC that it has seen \"a lot of interest\" in these luxury upgrades, though it said it does not have the full numbers yet. The upgrades come on the heels of an industry report predicting that business travel spending will return to pre-pandemic levels in 2026 rather than 2024, as previously forecast. Though spending by business travelers has been on the upswing, the Global Business Travel Association (GBTA) annual report stated that the 2021 figure was still less than half of the over $1.4 trillion that was generated by in business travel in 2019. One travel analytics company, however, noted a shift in demand toward premium seats. \"During the pandemic, we saw that the numbers of people travelling by air collapsed. However, the proportion of travelers flying in premium cabins increased significantly,\" Olivier Ponti of ForwardKeys told CNBC in an email.\nPonti said that before the pandemic, the split between premium and economy seats was a ratio of 13:87, compared with 17:83 in 2022.\n\"While there's no guarantee that the shift towards premium seats will be maintained as air travel recovers, one can understand why the airlines would want to invest in keeping hold of premium passengers, who, this year have typically spent 575% more on a seat than those flying economy.\" Others are skeptical, however. Edward Russell, an editor at Skift, a travel industry news site, told CNBC it's unclear how much of an effect \"small\" product changes will have on sales. \"Most travelers either fly the airline, or alliance, where they have loyalty, or opt for the cheapest fare. It is only a small subset of travelers who will actually book a flight based on the addition of a sliding door or unlimited caviar.\""},

But at the same time, when I came back from that trip I felt like I'm living a life that I'm not enjoying.\" Tyminas flew from Denver to Paris with his dog \u2014 an 82-pound Borzoi, once known as the \"Russian Wolfhound,\" named Cosmo, who is over 6 feet tall on his hind legs. \"They gave me three rows of seats, and the dog was just laying on the floor,\" he said. From there, the couple traveled often \u2014 to places like Italy and Iceland \u2014 but not yet full time, they said. Then Karpitskaya got what she called her \"dream job\" \u2014 a position with Emirates airline. She moved to Dubai, but the couple continued to meet and travel together. Then Covid hit, and Karpitskaya accepted four months of unpaid leave from her job. \"We said: We have four months \u2014 we can go explore whatever is open,\" said Tyminas. The trio \u2014 including Cosmo, who traveled in a huge bed in the back of their SUV \u2014 traveled first to Croatia, then slowly across much of Europe, including many former Soviet states, said Karpitskaya. She never returned to her job, and couple have been traveling ever since, she said. In the beginning, they spent between $1,000 and $2,000 a month \u2014 all from savings \u2014 by staying in cheap accommodations, cooking at home and seeking out free activities, said Tyminas. As money started to dry up, Tyminas took several online jobs, which netted between $2,000 and $3,000 a month, which wasn't far from his salary of $3,300 in Colorado, he said. But the work was cumbersome, and it \"felt like I still had a job,\" he said. So the couple decided to open a marketing and graphic design company, despite the fact that \"we didn't know a lot,\" said Tyminas. They reached out to thousands of people, they said, often working late into the night. Potential customers would ask, \"Can you design book covers?\" \"Can you promote music?\" Tyminas said his response was always the same, \"Of course I can.\" In reality, he was learning on the job, he said, relying on YouTube, Google and online research. But clients were very happy, he said. \"They paid me half of what they would pay other marketing agencies and the results, they said, were better than they had before,\" said Tyminas. In the first month, the couple made $6,000, he said. Now, sometimes they earn several thousand dollars in a day working with real estate companies and music labels, he added. \"We write blogs for people \u2014 we do everything,\" said Tyminas. Plus \"we don't have to report to anybody. We're our own bosses.\" In the past six months, the couple said they spent an average of $4,000 a month. More than half goes to accommodations, which vary by location \u2014 from $3,100 per month in Dubai to $1,500 in Lisbon, Portugal, they said. They limit stays in expensive locations, like Switzerland, to no more than a week, they said. One way to save money is booking monthlong stays on Airbnb, which cuts down average nightly rates and reduces service and cleaning fees, said Tyminas. But even when they bounced from place to place to visit Europe's Christmas markets last year, they still ended up paying about $2,500 that month, he said. Karpitskaya said she doesn't want these costs to scare people because they spent far less in the beginning. At the time, they spent about 80-100% of their income, but now Tyminas said \"we spend about 30% and \u2026 save the rest.\" The couple told CNBC they still travel modestly \u2014 no five-star hotels \u2014 and they still cook most meals at home. But they spend more on activities that they film for their YouTube channel Dream Team Travels \u2014 another \"completely self-taught\" venture, they said. A life of constant travel isn't all fun and games, they said. They encounter dirty Airbnbs and hosts who cancel reservations at the last minute. They've also had their camera equipment and clothing stolen twice \u2014 once in Mexico, and more recently in France \u2014 plus an attempted theft of their belongings from their car in Barcelona, while they were sitting in it. They have also thought about settling down when they find a place they really love, such as the beaches of Portugal or the French Riviera, said Tyminas. \"But then \u2026 we drive somewhere else and we're like this place is also just as good,\" he said. When Russia invaded Ukraine, quickly occupying the Kherson region where Karpitskaya's parents live, Tyminas emailed CNBC to say that they'd stopped traveling for the time being. \"The first few weeks we didn't even leave our apartment,\" he said. \"We spent a lot of time arranging transportation for civilians as well as many dogs from shelters to be taken out of dangerous regions for adoption in Europe.\" By the summer, they had resumed traveling, but were still helping to evacuate Karpitskaya's family. \"Just a week ago we were able to finally get Darina's parents out of Ukraine,\" said Tyminas, adding that they are currently in his family's home in Lithuania. \"We also did a trip to Romania to pick up Darina's sister and her five-month-old baby from the border and took her to live in Germany.\" The couple are now in Malaysia, they said, and plan to explore Southeast Asia for the next two months."},

Here are their stories. Job: Emmy-award winning TV host of \" Samantha Brown's Places to Love\"\nStarted in: Comedy \" I went to Syracuse University for musical theater because I so desperately wanted to move to New York City and become a thespian. I wanted to do Shakespeare and be on Broadway. That didn't pan out. I waited on tables for a good eight years. But I loved improv, and I was a part of an improv comedy troupe. So I just kept auditioning for jobs. A writer recommended me to a production company that was \u2026 looking for a host. But my audition for it had to be totally improvised. That's how I got the job. When you are a travel host, there's no script. Yet it is still up to you to define the scene, to understand the trajectory of a story and how to end it. Also in improv, the golden rule is to never say no, it's always yes \u2014 to keep things going. Waiting on tables in New York City for eight years, you start to be really humbled, [but] those were the tools that I had that got me a job that I never in my wildest dreams thought I would ever have.\" Job: Creator of \" Strictly Dumpling\" and other YouTube channels (total: about 8 million subscribers)\nStarted in: Accounting and wedding videography \"I moved to the U.S. from China when I was 8 years old. My parents started working in restaurants, and eventually started their own very Americanized Chinese restaurant. So I grew up on a steady diet of General Tso's chicken and crab rangoon. There wasn't a lot of diversity where I'm from, but it helped that my parents sent me back to China when I was 13. Most people get grounded and sent to their room as a punishment \u2014 I got sent to China for two years. That's when I was like: Wow, it's so amazing \u2014 the people, the history \u2014 I want to know more. After college, I went to New York and worked on Wall Street for a year. Then I became a wedding videographer because I wanted to be flexible. I was living in a small basement apartment in Brooklyn with no air conditioning, making about $400 \u2014 on a good week. But this was the first time I was eating something that wasn't Red Lobster and Olive Garden. I got a taste of diverse ethnic food in Chinatown, and I started to discover a lot of my heritage that I never really saw as important before. I started recording food videos on YouTube as a food diary for myself. I remember having a conversation with a friend that food content will never amount to anything. There wasn't anybody online doing it. I had like 10 subscribers. Somehow it grew to this, which was never expected. I never really had much money growing up \u2014 or throughout most of my adulthood. So I was always looking for things that were inexpensive but also really filling and delicious. And that's pretty much what I do around the world now.\" Job: Television host of \" Family Travel with Colleen Kelly\"\nStarted in: Sales \"I tried out for the broadcast school at the University of Texas. The school gave you one chance to be accepted into the program. I had never sat at an anchor desk with a camera pointed at me. I failed miserably. Several years later, I graduated and got my first job in sales, eventually moving to Chicago and working in the pharmaceutical industry. The money was amazing, and I had a company car. But I wasn't living my dream, and this started to really bother me. In my early 30s, I got married and eventually quit my job to be a stay-at-home mom. One day, when my two little girls were in school, I went to our town hall's cable TV station and asked if, in exchange for teaching me how to edit, I could host the local entertainment show about our village \u2014 something like \"Access Hollywood\" for our 50,000-resident town. Because they had no other offers, they said yes. I acted confident, but I was as green as they come. I was shaking in my boots every time I did an interview and read voice-over, but I was gaining experience and knowledge. I confided in another mom that my dream was to host a national travel show, and, surprisingly, she agreed to produce it with me. We wrote a script, found a local camera guy for a few dollars and made a pilot. I took meetings with two major companies \u2014 both said no. I was told by one network that women don't watch travel shows, so the concept of family travel didn't appeal to them. I then sent thousands of emails to television stations. Nothing worked. Finally, my mother suggested I call the local PBS station. I googled the head of programming, called him (no emails) and got a meeting. After more meetings, we learned PBS was picking two shows to go national, and \"Family Travel with Colleen Kelly\" was one of them. We scraped by for a year, producing 13 episodes that first season. Now, the show has been on for more than 10 years. And, the best part is that I can bring my family with me. It's been a long and arduous journey, but I hope this story inspires others to believe in themselves, ignore the naysayers, and never give up on their dream.\" Editor's note: These interviews have been edited for length and clarity."},

However, for more than 90% of patients on statins who experience muscle pain, the statin is not the cause of the pain, according to a published Monday in The Lancet and presented at the European Society of Cardiology Congress in Spain. \"Our results confirm that, in the majority of cases, statin therapy is not likely to be the cause of muscle pain in a person taking statin therapy,\" said the study, led by authors from Oxford Population Health and the Medical Research Council Population Health Research Unit at the University of Oxford. \"This finding is particularly true if the treatment has been well tolerated for a year or more before developing symptoms.\" The authors conducted a meta-analysis of 19 randomized double-blind trials of statin regimens versus placebos. All trials had over 1,000 participants and at least two years of follow up. They also looked at four double-blind trials of more and less intense statin regimens. Study author Colin Baigent, a professor of epidemiology at University of Oxford, said that there have been many non-randomized studies which don't involve any kind of placebo or random allocation to a statin that have produced \"really quite extreme\" estimates of how much muscle pain statins cause. \"This has put patients off starting statins, or made them stop treatment when they develop muscle pain because they simply look in the paper and they see that statins cause lots and lots of muscle pain and so they stop,\" Baigent said during a Science Media Center briefing. \"We were really trying to deal with that problem.\" The new study says that \"even during the first year of a moderate-intensity statin regimen, it is likely to be the cause in only approximately one in 15 patients who report muscle symptoms, rising to approximately one in 10 in those who are taking a more intensive regimen. \"In other words, the statin is not the cause of muscle symptoms in more than 90% of individuals who report such symptoms.\" The authors found that in the first year, statin therapy produced a 7% relative increase in muscle pain or weakness, but there was no significant increase after that. The increased risk was already present within the first three months after treatment was assigned. There were reports of at least one episode of muscle pain or weakness from 27.1% of patients assigned a statin versus 26.6% of those who had a placebo during a median 4.3 year follow up. In the trials looked at by the authors, they say that statin therapy, during the first year of use, caused approximately 11 additional muscle pain reports per 1,000 patients. \"What we conclude is that there are two things that we need to do as a profession, as a society,\" Baigent said in the briefing. \"The first thing is, we need to do a better job of managing patients who report muscle pain when they are taking a statin, because there's a tendency in patients to end up stopping the statin and that has a detrimental effect on their long term health. And the second thing we need to do is we need to look at the information that is available to patients in package inserts.\" He noted that if people were better informed about the real risks of muscle pains, then they might stay on statin therapy for longer. The study does have some limitations, including considerable heterogeneity in the methods used for muscle symptoms, some adverse event data not being available and most of the studies not excluding participants who may now be categorized as statin intolerant. In a commentary published alongside the study, Dr. Maciej Banach, a cardiologist at the Medical University of Lodz and Polish Mother's Memorial Hospital Research Institute in Poland, wrote that the possible side effects of statins shouldn't be a consideration when starting treatment. \"It should be strong emphasized that the small risk of muscle symptoms is insignificant in comparison with the highly proven cardiovascular benefits of statins,\" he wrote. The says heart disease is the leading cause of death for men, women and those of most racial and ethnic groups in the United States. There is one cardiovascular disease death every 34 seconds in the country. Last week, the US Preventive Services Task Force announced its latest guidance on the use of statins to prevent a first heart attack or stroke. The guidelines are more conservative than those put out by other groups, such as the American College of Cardiology. They recommend statins in adults 40 to 75 who have at lease one risk factor of cardiovascular disease and a 10% or high risk of a heart attack in the next 10 years. According to the , \"statins are recommended for most partients and have been directly associated with a reduction in the risk of heart attack and stroke. Statins continue to provide the most effective lipid-lowering treatment in most cases.\" CNN's Jen Christensen contributed to this report"},

Bollywood celebrities including Priyanka Chopra, Richa Chadha and Farhan Akhtar are among those to have lambasted the commercial for Layer'r Shot, a brand of male fragrance, calling it \"shameful,\" \"disgusting\" and \"incredibly tasteless.\" Its controversial advert shows four men appearing to stalk a frightened-looking woman in a store before cutting to one of the men saying, \"We're four, there's one, who takes the shot?\" Only when the woman turns round does it become clear they are talking about the body spray -- which one of the men then takes from a store shelf and uses. The commercial caused a storm on social media, where critics including various celebrities blasted its innuendo as making light of rape. Many said the timing of the advert made it particularly insensitive, as it was broadcast just a week after a case in which a 17-year-old was allegedly raped by five men in the southern city of Hyderabad -- against women and minority groups across the country. \"This advertisement is clearly promoting sexual violence against women and girls and promoting a rapist mentality among men. The advertisement is cringeworthy and should not be allowed to be played on mass media,\" wrote Swati Maliwal, chairwoman of the Delhi Commission for Women, to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting on Saturday. Within 24 hours, the ministry had taken the commercial off the air and asked Twitter and YouTube to remove it from their platforms. In an email to Twitter, the ministry said the videos were \"detrimental to the portrayal of women in the interest of decency and morality\" and violated the digital media ethics code. In a statement Monday, Layer'r Shot apologized for the television advertisement, saying it \"never intended to hurt anyone's sentiments or feelings or outrage any woman's modesty or promote any sort of culture, as wrongly perceived by some.\" The brand said it had voluntarily asked all its media partners to stop broadcasting variations of the advertisement from Saturday with immediate effect. Even after the commercial was taken down, it continued to cause a controversy. Actress Richa Chadha was among those registering her disgust, calling the makers of the commercial \"filth.\" \"Creatives, script, agency, client, casting... does everyone think rape is a joke?,\" Chadha tweeted. Responding to Chadha's Tweet, Quantico star called the ad \"shameful and disgusting\" and said she was glad that the ministry has taken it down. Film writer and director Farhan Akhtar also . \"What incredibly tasteless and twisted minds it must take to think up, approve and create these stinking body spray 'gang rape' innuendo ads. Shameful,\" tweeted Akhtar, who is also a United Nations Women's Goodwill Ambassador. Actress Swara Bhasker said both the perfume brand and its marketing agency had been \"tone deaf\" given the alleged gang rape of the teenager in an upscale part of Hyderabad last Saturday. The case has shocked the state of Telangana, of which Hyderabad is the capital. Telangana's home minister Mohammed Mahmood Ali said on Saturday that \"strong action will be taken against all the offenders, irrespective of their background.\" It was \"a ghastly incident,\" the minister on Saturday."},

According to a report from the US Department of Labor, 232,000 Americans filed first-time unemployment claims in the week ending August 27, a drop of 5,000 from the previous week's level, which was revised downward by 6,000 claims. That's the lowest level since the week ending June 25, which reported 231,000 first-time claims. The decline in first-time claims also beat expectations from economists, who had predicted claims would increase. It also comes on the heels of several weeks of unexpected declines. The Labor Department said the number of continuing jobless claims for the week ended August 20 rose by 26,000 to 1.44 million, the highest level since early April. The weekly jobless claim data is subject to revisions, however. Despite recession fears and the Federal Reserve's attempts to slow the jobs market down, employers don't appear to be rushing to hand out pink slips. Earlier this week, the Bureau of Labor Statistics unexpectedly rose in July to 11.2 million and there were 1.4 million layoffs, down 2,000 from June. While there have been several headlines about layoffs recently, the cuts seem to be mostly confined to certain types of businesses or industries. The bulk of have come from technology and tech-adjacent companies that scaled up their workforces to handle the sudden demand for their services during the pandemic, said said Ron Hetrick, senior labor economist for labor market analytics firm Lightcast. Because of health-and-safety measures and related public gathering restrictions, consumer dollars previously spent on services shifted to goods. And the underlying technology enabling those purchases needed to grow, he said. US employers announced 20,485 layoffs in August, a 21% drop from the month before but an increase of 30% from the same month a year ago, when the nation was still in the height of pandemic jobs recovery, according to a separate report from outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The number of job cuts announcements made through August is the lowest year-to-date total since 1993, Challenger, Gray & Christmas noted."},

It's not clear if that will last", "paragraphs": " The pace of new monkeypox cases reported in some major cities -- and in the US overall -- has started to slow recently, but experts say it's too early to know if the trend will last. On Friday, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said that she is \"cautiously optimistic\" about the downward trend, but warned that the overall case count is still growing. \"The rate of rise is lower, but we are still seeing increases and we are of course a very diverse country and things are not even across the country. So, we're watching this with cautious optimism,\" she said. Last week, there were an average of 337 new cases of monkeypox reported each day in the US, according to . That's a 24% drop from two weeks earlier -- a difference of more than 100 cases a day. A few factors are \"working together to bend the curve,\" Walensky said, including vaccination, behavior changes and harm reduction messages \"being heard and implemented.\" But many more factors are still in flux, leaving questions unanswered. Local health departments say they are working hard to understand the factors driving case trends. Washington, DC, has been an epicenter of the outbreak since the beginning; the city has had nearly 12 times more cases per capita than the country overall. The local health department has seen a \"slight decrease\" in cases over the past week, but said that \"education and vaccines\" are two key factors that will drive trends going forward. And \"with 100,000 students that will return to DC within the next week, it is too early to project the trends,\" they said. The California health department said that state trends over the last several weeks suggest \"stabilizing rather than increasing transmission levels\" and daily cases \"leveling off.\" \"The trend could continue but will depend on vaccination and behavior change as noted previously,\" they said. New York City Health Commissioner Dr. Ashwin Vasan said last week that the city has also seen \"cases begin to fall and transmission slow\" in recent days. Even if cases rise again, Donal Bisanzio, a senior epidemiologist with the nonprofit research group RTI International, predicts that there will be a \"rapid reduction\" at some point. Monkeypox \"is a disease that gives you full protection after you get it,\" he said. Reinfections aren't a factor. But no one knows for sure what's next. \"I think every public health response that I have ever worked, we want a crystal ball. It's just exceedingly hard to get there really early on, even for things that we have understood much better for years,\" said Janet Hamilton, executive director of the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists. \"Tell me when influenza season is going to end. I can't. \" Experts say that the ongoing outbreak is a rapidly evolving situation, making it difficult to know what to expect in the coming weeks and months. \"There is a very strong interest in using models and thinking about what the trajectories would be in different scenarios,\" Hamilton told CNN. All data-driven models require that at least some reasonable assumptions are incorporated. But with monkeypox, the United States is still collecting some of the foundational \"shoe leather epidemiology, boots on the ground pieces,\" Hamilton said. It's a \"highly infectious disease that's spreading very rapidly that we don't fully understand.\" Some of the stigma attached to the current outbreak may make people reluctant to seek medical attention, discuss recent contacts or come forward to get vaccinated, experts say. \"I'm always concerned about stigma and discrimination, as it can hinder trying to control an outbreak like this,\" said Dr. Wafaa El-Sadr, a professor of epidemiology at Columbia University who has researched HIV, emerging infections and other diseases. It could mean people aren't \"taking advantage of the important tools we have at hand to stop this outbreak.\" Generally, only about 15 to 25% of contacts are being identified, which can skew the understanding of the rate of disease spread, Hamilton said. \"That ends up being a very distinct challenge that then would directly impact what those models look like.\" While men who have sex with men have been disproportionately affected in the current outbreak, anyone can get monkeypox and a growing number of cases reported recently have been among women and children -- potentially changing the transmission map even more. And a recent shift in the federal vaccination strategy -- that potentially expands the existing vaccine supply by as much as five times, but poses other challenges -- marks a major change to another key forecasting factor. More than 1 million vials of the Jynneos vaccine have been allocated to states and other local jurisdictions, according to data from the US Department of Health and Human Services. However, only about 208,000 doses have been reported to the CDC as administered. In June, researchers from RTI International published that estimated the potential burden and duration of the monkeypox outbreak that did not yet have endemic disease. They projected that every three cases could cause 18 secondary cases if no prevention measures were put in place, with outbreaks lasting about six to nine months. Contact tracing and vaccination of close contacts could cut that risk by more than 70%, according to the model. But new knowledge and information has led them to adjust the model and rerun it, with updated estimates due out in a few weeks. \"We are talking about a model that was done just in the first month of transmission outside Africa. We were thinking that everything was going well,\" said Bisanzio, who is a co-author of RTI report. The model assumed that the public health response would be quick and effective, especially coming on the heels of the Covid-19 pandemic. \"We know that this story then evolved in a different way,\" he said, with a lag in response time, hesitancy around vaccination and transmission concentrated within one high-risk community that no one expected. \"I can tell you that the numbers (in the updated model) are much higher than the ones that we first estimated.\" That said, another one of the biggest adjustments to their model comes from a of men who have sex with men, in which about half of respondents said they changed their behaviors to protect themselves amid the ongoing outbreak. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington built an influential Covid-19 forecast model early on in the pandemic, but will not be doing the same for monkeypox. \"In our mind, this disease is not going to spread into the community as wide as we've seen with Covid,\" said Ali Mokdad, an epidemiologist and professor of health metrics sciences at IHME. There are some similarities to HIV that are concerning, but \"we don't see that being replicated here,\" he said, with monkeypox moving out of the body much faster and being much less deadly. While extensive data-driven models may be largely absent, experts say they are keeping a close watch on trends. \"You don't need a model to tell you that, at this point in time, the strategy has to be to identify those high risk individuals and vaccinate as many as possible,\" Hamilton said.

According to Colorado State University, the chances of Louisiana getting hit with a named storm within 50 miles this season are 84%. \"Oh Jesus, keep us spared,\" Tezeno sighed. As Tezeno and her fellow Louisianans try to mentally prepare for hurricanes yet to come, two years after Laura, Lake Charles -- 45 miles north of Cameron Parish -- still looks like a blue patchwork quilt. \"I still see blue tarps out there, there are plenty of homes and businesses that are still not completely put back together,\" Lake Charles National Weather Service meteorologist Stephen Corbani observed. \"There is a literal PTSD out there in the community,\" explained Lake Charles Mayor Nic Hunter. \"It's a visceral thing.\" The storm cost more than a billion dollars in the state of Louisiana alone, with more than 44,000 households approved by to receive housing assistance. According to , there are still more than 2,000 cases still open in the Lake Charles area -- that's 2,000 families still working to rebuild. \"We have some homes that literally have not been touched since Hurricane Laura,\" Hunter noted. But he told CNN they just got word . \"Though it has taken far too long, there is over a billion dollars in federal aid that has been allocated for hurricanes Laura and Delta. We are immensely thankful for that,\" he added. The previous two hurricane seasons have been particularly cruel for Louisiana. In 2020, , and in 2021, , a Category 4 behemoth, battered the southeastern part of the state on the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. The poundings have left residents wary of what lies ahead. \"Certainly, as we approach hurricane season, locals are just a bit more on edge than they were prior to 2020,\" Hunter acknowledged. While it is impossible to know exactly where these storms will make landfall, the forecasts are grim. \"Looking at some of the climate signals that are out there, like , it seems like we're in store for another above normal season, just in terms of numbers and activity across the Atlantic basin,\" Carboni projected. Lake Charles is home for Carboni too, and like Tezeno, he hopes this year's busy season doesn't end up affecting his area, still so vulnerable from two seasons ago. \"The last thing we need would be for another hurricane to affect this area,\" Carboni remarked. If you are in a hurricane zone and are preparing for the upcoming season, hopefully you have a plan for you and your family, as well as a . After talking to Tezeno, though, she expressed some advice I think many times gets overlooked. \"Write down everything that you have. I don't care if it's minor and take pictures of everything that you can and check your policy,\" she urged. She also recommended securing your home if you evacuate. She recalled many of her neighbors fled their homes, only to come back and find it structurally damaged AND everything inside looted. Lastly, she advised having some sort of hurricane savings account. \"Have as much as you can to take care of yourself without relying on insurance, because sometimes they are not as quick to come to your aid as you think.\""},

But have you ever noticed hurricane hunters' flight patterns shown by meteorologists on TV look like random, odd shapes? Those flight patterns may look like boxes or stars, but they serve specific purposes for each individual storm. Hurricane hunters don't fly away from these storms like commercial airlines do. They fly directly into them, but they don't just fly into and around the storms randomly. There is a method to the madness. There are two distinctive groups of hurricane hunters, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the US Air Force Reserve (USAF). Both organizations fly missions into tropical disturbances in order to record invaluable data used by forecasters at the National Hurricane Center (NHC). For the Hurricane Hunters, there are two main types of missions flown, fixed and invest. Fixed missions are designated for systems that meet tropical cyclone qualifications, such as tropical depressions, tropical storms, and hurricanes. The main objective is to mark the center of circulation, monitor winds speeds and pressure changes, and other variables that are tricky for satellites in space to measure in full detail. For fixed missions, 'Alpha' is most common flight pattern used to collect data in a tropical cyclone. \"The Alpha pattern is the standard profile we fly for fix missions so it's the one people are most familiar with seeing from us,\" , meteorologist and aerial reconnaissance weather officer with the Air Force Reserve's , said. \"The pattern consists of two legs flown at intercardinal directions, and when complete, looks a lot like the Greek Alpha symbol when including the crossleg.\" Cardinal directions are the standard points on a compass: north, south, east, and west. Intercardinal directions are the diagonal points in between: northeast, southeast, southwest, and northwest. Interestingly, the bigger, stronger storms tend to be the \"easier\" ones to fly in. \"From my perspective as the onboard meteorologist, the Alpha pattern is the \"easiest\" to fly. Because we normally fly those on stronger storms, there's not a lot of question where the storm center is,\" DeHart said. \"The flights can be rough of course, but at the end of the day we just go fly through the storm center, collect the data, and send it to NHC.\" The primary objective of an invest mission is to determine if a system meets the definition of a tropical cyclone; storms that do not yet have a name or any real tropical structure characteristics. For invest missions, the NHC will often send estimated coordinates of where they believe the center of circulation is, which is where the missions will target for their starting point. However, invest missions by nature have to be a bit more flexible for flight patterns, simply because there are so many unknowns with these types of storms. \"We never know what we're going to find, yet we always have to be thinking two or three steps ahead. So that really makes us need to think about the meteorology [in each particular storm],\" DeHart said. \"Is it a closed low or an open wave? Maybe it's closed but just elongated? Is it battling shear? Are there several smaller swirls competing to be the main circulation center? Weak storms and invests can be very tricky and require a lot of thinking on our toes.\" Air Force Hurricane Hunters have a to choose from for invest missions: X, Delta, and Box, just to name a few. DeHart explains the missions are ideal for the weaker, more uncertain storms. While the X pattern may resemble the Alpha pattern, it is flown at much lower altitudes, usually around 500 to 1,000 feet. \"Once a system becomes a tropical storm or hurricane, the hurricane hunters begin flying at higher altitudes, ranging from 5,000 to 10,000 feet depending on the severity of the storm,\" said Jessica Kendziorek, public affairs operations chief with the USAF 403rd Wing. Flight levels for the Delta and Box patterns are usually at or below 5,000 ft absolute altitude. \"The Delta and Box patterns are similar in that we'll fly around the periphery of the forecast center seeing if we can observe winds in all four quadrants of the storm that would indicate a closed circulation. If we find a closed circulation, we can confidently go [find] the center; if not, we'll continue the mission in 'invest mode',\" DeHart said. NOAA Hurricane Hunters also fly operational fixed and invest missions (though the names may be different), but they usually have more research-oriented objectives. They fly many unique , with different types of aircraft, depending on what type of mission is assigned. Hurricane Hunters also fly a third type of mission, which the Air Force rarely flies, according to DeHart, called synoptic missions. For fixed missions NOAA often flies a Figure 4, Rotated Figure 4 pattern, or a Butterfly pattern. \"The Butterfly and Figure 4 patterns flown by the WP-3D through the storm are typically the ones used to [find] the center of circulation,\" said Jonathan Shannon, public affairs specialist for the NOAA Aircraft Operations Center Office of Marine and Aviation Operations. The Rotated Figure 4 pattern is as it sounds; the Figure 4 pattern turned on side. \"The goal with every flight is to gather data all around the center of the storm, and those patterns allow us to efficiently fly through a storm's various quadrants,\" Nick Underwood, NOAA Hurricane Hunter, said. \"This data helps with predicting a storm's intensity, as well as determining exactly where the center is.\" For invest missions, the Lawnmower and Square Spiral patterns are flown, to determine if there are actual tropical characteristics associated with the area in which they are investigating. \"The Lawnmower Pattern allows us to map out a large area when we don't have a center to aim for,\" Paul Flaherty, science branch chief at NOAA's Aircraft Operations Center, said. \"Once we are able to map a full circulation (usually by finding a west wind), we'll shift back to Figure 4's based on that newly identified center position.\" The Square Spiral pattern is a survey mission meant to supply observations on the structure and characteristics including information about the vortex center, if it exists. There is a unique third type of mission flight pattern, often used to sample the surrounding atmosphere which helps forecasters know the direction the storm is likely to go. The Star 1 pattern focuses on a scan of the outer edges of the system. The closely-related Star 2 pattern also does an outer scan of the system, while also adding in a circumference loop near the center of circulation. Recently, NOAA's Gulfstream IV flew a Star-2 pattern around Hurricane Larry, to investigate outflow patterns from the storm and better determine where the storm was headed. \"The flight pattern you'll typically see from our Gulfstream IV is a circumnavigation of the storm itself, as well as sampling of the atmosphere around and ahead of the storm,\" Underwood said. \"This data helps with predicting the storm's track.\" Regardless of which entity is flying, the operational missions are the backbone for the National Hurricane Center, tasked with providing essential life-saving information about a storm. The NHC takes the data and uses it to issue guidance and advisories to the public, so people know whether Elsa or Ida or Nicholas are still tropical storms or have become hurricanes. We ended 2020 with a 30 named storms in the Atlantic basin and if this season is anything like last year, we have a long way to go."},
{"url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2021/04/26/weather/tornado-facts-formation-supercell/index.html", "title": "This is how a thunderstorm produces a tornado", "paragraphs": " Tornadoes are one of Earth's most violent forces of nature. They have occurred in all 50 states and have been spotted throughout the year. While they are most common in the United States, tornadoes can occur all over the globe. While great strides have been made in the study of tornadoes, there's still so much we don't know about them. They have been studied immensely during the last few decades to learn what causes them and how they form. CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller, who is also a storm chaser, has been following and studying these storms since 2005. \"Something you learn from studying tornadoes, especially in the field, is that there is no perfect formula for forming a tornado -- every storm is unique,\" says Miller. \"Sometimes, it may appear that a storm is in a perfect environment for a tornado to form, yet it never does. Conversely, tornadoes frequently form in marginal environments where it seems like one or more 'ingredients' to storm formation is missing or lacking,\" says Miller. While there's no perfect formula as to which storms will produce tornadoes, there's commonality in the anatomy of the systems that result in tornadoes. There are even signs you can see that will help you understand the life cycle of a developing storm that could produce a tornado. As warm air rises, clouds begin to grow taller and taller. This is the developing phase of the thunderstorm. You can see fluffy white cumulus clouds grow taller with your own eyes. This is before you see rain or hear thunder. As the clouds grow, you will notice the bottom of the cloud darkening. You will many times see the very top of the cloud flattening out, creating an anvil shape that protrudes from the top of the cloud. This indicates very cold air at the top of the cloud and could be a precursor to the possibility of hail. As the storm matures, it could become what's known as a supercell. A supercell is a rotating thunderstorm. \"Nearly all supercells produce some sort of severe weather (large hail or damaging winds) but only 30 percent or less produce tornadoes,\" says the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. During this mature phase of the thunderstorm or supercell; heavy rain, lightning, hail and very strong winds are expected. Sometimes, you will feel a strong gust of wind a few moments before the rain arrives. This is called a gust front. This is caused by cool air being forced down from the storm cloud. When the cold air hits the ground, it spreads out quickly, ahead of the storm. This is a sure sign that a storm is near. Tornadoes are usually formed from supercells. These supercells develop when there are several ingredients in place to help them thrive: instability, lift and wind shear. Within the supercell, wind shear becomes a crucial component to the storms development. Shear is when winds change directions with height. This creates spin within the thunderstorm cloud. Another force that's acting inside the supercel is a downdraft. This is an area of drier air that is pushed down from the storm. As it's forced down, it wraps around the backside of the storm. The updrafts and downdrafts work in tandem to pull the horizontal column of air down to form the tornado. This vertical column of air is called a funnel cloud until it touches the ground -- at that point it becomes a tornado. \"The most telltale sign that a tornado could be forming, when you are looking at a close-range severe thunderstorm, is the 'wall cloud,'\" says Miller. The wall cloud is a lowering of the cloud base that will lead to the vortex, or spinning of air. When this rotating column of air touches the ground, a tornado has formed. The presence of a wall cloud doesn't always mean a tornado will form, but it certainly ups the odds. \"You will know you are looking at a wall cloud because it will hang noticeably lower than the rest of the thunderstorm and you may notice it is rotating if you look closely,\" says Miller. Most tornadoes are relatively small and short-lived, and can still be dangerous and cause damage. However, more violent tornadoes can be more than a mile wide and stay on the ground for more than an hour. This is because they have much more momentum than the smaller tornadoes, making them harder to stop. Miller has witnessed roughly 15-20 tornadoes during his years storm chasing. \"There is no denying that there is a certain amount of excitement that comes from seeing a tornado when you are set out with the intent of seeing one,\" says Miller. \"At the same time, you are balancing that excitement with a sizable amount of anxiety and concern over what the tornado could do, especially if there are residents in the immediate path of the storm. As someone who spent years studying, and many more years reporting on, tornadoes, it still gets all my nerves firing when you see a tornado in person.\" The smaller tornadoes have winds of 60-110 mph, while the more violent tornadoes can have winds from 160 to more than 200 miles per hour. The strongest winds ever recorded on Earth were from a tornado, on at more than  CNN's Jackson Dill and CNN meteorologist Haley Brink contributed to this report"},

I've visited the Wall of Wind on the Florida International University (FIU) campus many times. It is a wall of enormous fans inside a big warehouse-type building that can blow air up to 160 mph, which would be a Category 5 hurricane, to test infrastructure and research the power of wind. However, in our changing climate, sadly, 160 mph isn't strong enough. So, the National Science Foundation (NSF) just awarded a $12.8 million Extreme Events Institute for the design of a full-scale testing facility capable of producing winds of 200 mph, along with a water basin to simulate storm surge and wave action in extreme winds. FIU will be able to build a house under the current building codes, start up the fans and see if it can withstand 200 mph winds. Will the roof detach? Will the house still be standing at all? The water basin will look like an enormous pool. It will also be able to simulate different coastlines. Storm surge tends to be worse when the coastlines are more shallow like along the Florida Panhandle. The facility will be able to simulate all of it. \"If you think about trying to future-proof, a changing hazard environment, a hazard scape, the US hazard scape with climate change, the past is not much of a guide. In fact, it can be deceiving,\" said Dr. Richard Olson, director of the Extreme Events Institute at FIU. \"So, if we're going to future-proof, we need to be able to research and test what future hazard events will look like. You can't future-proof in a changing environment if you're looking backwards.\" It's true. Climate change is showing us r, moving slower and are holding more water than ever before. They are also rapidly intensifying, meaning the winds are increasing at least 35 mph in a 24-hour period. In 2021, five hurricanes in the Atlantic rapidly intensified. And in 2020, TEN Atlantic hurricanes rapidly intensified. of those storms. \"Dorian in 2019 is the one that totally got my attention,\" said Olson. \"It hit 185 mph over the Bahamas, and until the last day and a half, it was heading straight up Eighth Street in Miami.\" Dorian ended up causing across Abaco and Grand Bahama. \"The scientific consensus is that we're going to see more intense storms, so we have to research and test for more intense storms,\" said Olson. \"Otherwise, nature's going to keep hitting us with harder stuff than we're ready for.\" The facility will be the first of its kind in the world to combine wind speeds of greater magnitude along with a water component. Eventually the facility will be able to test how different types of infrastructure, roads, bridges will all respond with a Category 6 storm. \"We can start putting all of these components together to get a much better picture of what nature is going to be hitting us with,\" says Olson. Yes, I realized I just referred to it as a Category 6 storm. And it might make some of you a little uncomfortable. To be honest, it bothers me a little bit too. But to be fair, if you look at the for the hurricanes, they are all -- more or less -- in about 20 mph increments. When a Category 5 hurricane's wind speeds start at 157 mph, and we see storms with maximum sustained winds of 180 mph, it's a number that makes me go pale. Since 2010, there have been 18 storms globally with recorded wind speeds of at least 178 mph at some point during their life span. and were two storms in the Atlantic to meet the threshold. It begs the question, especially for messaging purposes, do these types of storms need a special name? Category 6? Super-hurricane? Just something to put an exclamation point on how intense these specific storms are. But the truth of the matter is, most people who die in hurricanes don't die from wind, but from water. I reached out to my friend, Dennis Feltgen, the public affairs officer at the National Hurricane Center (NHC) about whether he thought there would ever be a day in our future we would see a Category 6, and here is what he had to say: I do agree with Dennis, but I also think as storms become stronger, wetter and slower, there might be a day the category system evolves from what it is now, just as the EF scale or Fujita scale was in 2007. And by the way, the same facility will also test tornado and thunderstorm winds. There are a few research facilities studying extreme winds. Watch below to see what 100 mph winds can do to a house. \"I think the interaction between the various components of hurricanes, the waves, the flooding, the currents, and the wind, the debris, all of that, it's very important to simulate that as practically as possible,\" said Dr. Arindam Gan Chowdhury, professor of environmental engineering at FIU. \"Everything is not possible to replicate Mother Nature.

It's called cloud seeding, and it's nothing new. It's been around since the 1940s and countries all over the world have been doing it for various reasons , but it's a growing practice in the US, especially in the drought-stricken West. It's also surrounded with controversy. We spoke with Julie Gondzar who is the program manager for , who admits she gets lots of calls about what they are doing. Gondzar said some people say \"you're playing God,\" others say \"you are stealing moisture from the storm,\" making other areas drier than they normally would be, kind of like robbing Peter to pay Paul. There are also environmental factors to consider, as well as the cost-effectiveness versus the reward, which in the West these days water is liquid gold. \"Think about it like water storage, but in the winter on mountaintops,\" is how Gondzar described what cloud seeding is trying to achieve in her state, \"in a nutshell.\" Wyoming started cloud seeding in 2003 . Then eight seasons ago, they started doing it in an official capacity after their 10-year study proved it works. This season, they have gone on 28 flight missions for cloud seeding in Wyoming. She pointed out there are four weeks left in the season, so she is hoping for more opportunities before it winds down. When you compare Wyoming to other states such as Utah and North Dakota, who have been cloud seeding since the '70s and '80s, the state is fairly new to the game. Cloud seeding uses an already existing cloud, and injects silver iodide into the cloud, which adds tiny particles called ice nuclei (which water needs to freeze). Clouds, in basic terms, are a collection of water droplets and/or ice crystals floating in the sky. The nuclei help the cloud produce precipitation, and artificial ice nuclei help create more precipitation than the cloud would produce otherwise. It's done in two ways: One way is from the ground and the other is from the air, using silver iodide as the seeding agent. \"The ground-based generators kind of look like small weather stations, are like 20 feet tall, and they aerosolize into the atmosphere,\" Gondzar explained. \"But you have to wait for the right atmospheric conditions so that the plume goes over the mountain range.\" It makes seeding a little more tricky, because if the wind is blowing in the wrong direction, you'll completely miss your target. The most popular way is by plane, using flares. \"There are flares on the wing of the planes with silver iodide inside of cardboard casings and there are flares on the belly of the plane,\" Gondzar pointed out. Once the pilot flies into the storm, they ignite the cardboard casings full of silver iodide and \"seed\" the clouds. The result is more moisture in the cloud, resulting in more precipitation. The silver iodide \"is a natural salt compound,\" Gondzar emphasized. \"The reason it's used is because the geometric shape down to a molecular level is very similar to that of an ice crystal. And if you don't have that, you're not going to create additional ice crystals, which will then accumulate into snowflakes.\" But if you think you can bust the drought by using planes to modify the weather, Gondzar said think again. \"Cloud seeding does not fix the drought,\" Gondzar said. \"You can't break a drought with cloud seeding. It's a tool in the toolbox.\" Gondzar admitted while they know the method makes more snow than they would otherwise receive, it's difficult to know exactly how much more they are getting. \"There's evidence of it in radar and all kinds of papers written,\" Gondzar noted. \"The question that they're trying to answer now is how well does it work? And that's a difficult question to answer. Because there's an abstract piece of this. There's really no way to know how much snow a particular system would have produced.\" She knows cloud seeding doesn't generate a lot of additional snowfall, but every little bit helps these days. According to , some areas in the state are only at 60% of average for snowpack this season, and the window for additional snow is slowly closing as the season winds down. Since most of the West gets the majority of its water from snowmelt, she hopes what they are doing helps a tiny bit in the long term. \"It's a small incremental change over a long period of time. That's why consistency is important,\" Gondzar urged. She added at $28-$34 per acre foot, cloud seeding is relatively cheap. \"Those numbers tell us that this is an inexpensive way to help add water to the system. Essentially, we are creating a little bit of additional snowpack, that becomes additional streamflow in the spring and summer.\" But you need a cloud, to cloud seed. You can't just go out to the Mojave Desert and make it rain. \"This is not something that we can do out of thin air,\" Gondzar cautioned. \"The criteria is very specific for this to actually work.\" It can only be done within already existing clouds that were going to produce snow anyway and there has to be a certain temperature range. \"The silver iodide in the cloud is initiating that snow,\" Gondzar said. \"But you can't just make snow out of nothing. You have to have the supercooled liquid water in the cloud.\" She explained part of what made this year difficult was the much drier weather during the last month. There were fewer opportunities to cloud seed. \"A lot of people think it's manipulating the weather pattern,\" Gondzar remarked. \"We are essentially just playing with cloud dynamics and cloud physics, on a super, super-small scale.\" She is a meteorologist as well and points out the moisture from the weather systems come from much bigger areas like the Gulf of Mexico or the Pacific. \"There's always a huge stream of moisture that our systems are tapping into, and cloud seeding probably brings an additional one to 2% down to the surface.\" While Gondzar is confident cloud seeding doesn't steal snow from another area, some scientists disagree. Daniel Swain is a climate scientist at UCLA and spoke with my colleague and climate writer . He told her \"It is possible that you're actually stealing water from someone else when you do this, because it may be, at least on a regional basis, a zero-sum game where if water falls out of the cloud in one spot, it's even drier by the time it makes it downwind to the next watershed.\" He went on to ask, \"To what extent are you just shifting around the spatial distribution of precipitation during a scarcity period rather than actually causing it to rain or snow more overall?\" He believes water equity issues need to be researched more. Another note of controversy has been the safety of the chemicals used in cloud seeding. Gondzar stressed it is not made of harmful chemicals like some people claim. She pointed out they did lots of testing for before they started officially cloud seeding and could not find any traces of harmful amounts of silver. \"There's silver in natural background levels in the water in the soil everywhere, on the surface of the earth,\" Gondzar noted. \"So you already have a natural background level of silver, it's been really difficult to find anything beyond background levels.\" She said the amount of silver iodide used is only a few grams at a time. What she's hoping is a small price to pay for bigger rewards down the road. There have been climate concerns surrounding cloud seeding. Here's more from Ramirez, who reached out to a few scientists, to get their take on cloud seeding's climate angle. Although cloud seeding has been around for decades and is currently being operated in roughly 50 countries, many climate scientists remain skeptical of the technology's efficacy as well as the time and effort put into trying to manipulate weather. Swain pointed out it has been historically difficult to design scientific experiments to test the effectiveness of cloud seeding, leaving behind a trail of unclear, intangible evidence on what the benefits are. \"How do you know how much precipitation that might actually end up falling from that cloud occurred due to the seeding? Or how much would have fallen without the seeding?\" Swain told CNN. \"This isn't a setting where you can do a truly controlled experiment.\" Cloud seeding experiments typically deal with a narrow set of parameters, according to Swain, taking into account weather conditions including cloud cover, time of the day, and location. Additionally, the rapidly changing climate adds another layer to the list of variables. As the planet warms, weather patterns and clouds will constantly evolve, often in unexpected ways. That's what Sarah Tessendorf, a scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, and other researchers from universities and an Idaho power company, set out to examine in 2017. , published in 2020 in the Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences, managed to quantify how effective cloud seeding is. Yet uncertainties still linger. During the cold winter months in 2017, the researchers flew aircraft to inject silver iodine, the seeding chemical used, into clouds over the Payette Basin in Idaho, while simultaneously using radars and models to measure its impact on snowfall. In three cloud-seeding events, the scientists identified \"unambiguous seeding patterns,\" in cold cloud decks not producing ice at all; but once seeded, ice crystals formed inside mirroring the same pattern the aircraft had flown. They were then able to track the formed ice and snow to the ground and measure how much additional snow fell from the seeded clouds. Despite the results, Tessendorf said more experiments need to be done to improve the technology for it to become a sweeping solution to the climate crisis. The amount of precipitation produced by cloud seeding \u2014 up to 10% \u2014 isn't enough at all to quench the drought-stricken West. \"It could help over the years augment the storage levels in reservoirs, so that when you get into that extract, you might just go into that drought with a little bit more than you would have otherwise,\" she said. \"That to me is the way that cloud seeding should be viewed. It's not going to be the silver bullet, but it could be a helpful tool in a water manager's toolbox.\" When it comes to tackling climate change as a whole, many also question the methods such as the deployment of fossil fuel-powered aircraft to inject silver iodide into clouds, arguing it is counterintuitive to the overall climate goals of slashing fossil fuel emissions. But Tessendorf argued it is a small price to pay in order to improve the technology. \"I will say that the number of aircraft and the duration of these flights to do cloud seeding and the programs that are currently having it done pales in comparison to the number of commercial flights and aircraft we have in the skies all over the world right now,\" she contended. \"So it's to me a drop in the bucket of extra fossil fuels being burned.\" \"But that does not mean that there isn't room for improvement there in order to have more of a clean process,\" Tessendorf added. With the climate crisis accelerating, climate scientists like Swain say resources are much better invested in climate solutions already guaranteed to make significant and equitable impacts. \"There needs to be controlled studies that actually shows it was the seeding that increased the precipitation in a meaningful way,\" Swain asserted. \"The best case scenario is it's a small incremental adjunct to other water-saving or conservation measures during scarce periods, but even that's not clear if it would really work in that capacity in any systematic way.\" CNN meteorologist Judson Jones contributed to this article"},

The lack of after the hurricane, Taylor said, is just another example of the neglect the community has long suffered. Residents say the government failed to prepare the community for the storm by not issuing an evacuation order earlier or assisting poor and vulnerable residents who could not manage to flee their homes, like Cayette. \"The government is obviously failing us and not protecting us,\" said Taylor, who evacuated from St. John before Hurricane Ida hit. \"And this just pushed it over the top.\" The predominantly Black community of St. John and the nearly majority Black population of St. James sit at the heart of Louisiana's \"Cancer Alley,\" the 85-mile stretch between New Orleans and Baton Rouge that's home to more than 150 chemical plants and oil refineries.

Now, he lives alone with the sight of industrial facilities looming outside his window. \"I was mad and disappointed at the government,\" Cayette said about the lack of response after Ida. \"What concerned me even more is that I'm disabled, but they couldn't come to help.\" For decades, scientists have claimed the planet has been rapidly warming because of greenhouse gas emissions, particularly from the burning of fossil fuels. Days after Ida ravaged the homes of and Mississippi, the EPA concluding that racial and ethnic minority communities disproportionately suffer the most severe consequences of climate change, indicating they are the least able to prepare for, and recover from, extreme climate events such as pollution, flooding and heat waves. If the planet reaches the critical warming threshold of 2 degrees Celsius -- which most unless they drastically cut emitting greenhouse gases from fossil fuels -- the report warns that Black people are projected to face the worst impacts of the climate crisis. \"It's absolutely an insult that the companies that are responsible for this are also the ones that are driving climate change,\" Naomi Yoder, staff scientist at the Healthy Gulf, a group working to restore natural resources in the region, told CNN. \"They're also one of the biggest drivers of land loss in Louisiana, which makes the effects of hurricanes worse.\" The coronavirus pandemic has also hit both parishes especially hard. In April 2020, St. John had the highest death rate per capita for Covid-19 in the United States, surpassing even the most densely populated urban hotspots. Around that time in St. James, the Covid-19 death rate was also than the overall national death rate. More than a year later, with the pandemic persisting, Category 4 Hurricane Ida threw the area's high cancer and Covid-19 rates and underlying environmental health hazards, which come from the area's rampant pollution from fossil fuel industries, into harsh relief. \"It's just risk on top of risk on top of risk,\" Kimberly Terrell, director of community engagement at the Tulane University Environmental Law Clinic, told CNN. \"There's always air pollution coming out of industrial facilities, and these communities have been burdened with that for decades.\" The Rev. Lionel Murphy, pastor of Tchoupitoulas Chapel in St. John, said the storm left devastating damage to his church along with homes and other buildings in the parish, exacerbating the emotional and physical toll that air pollution and health disparities have placed on communities. \"If only we can get some attention,\" Murphy said, referring to public officials and emergency responders. \"The people are going to leave and come back, but this storm aggravates so much else because Covid is pretty strong in St. John.\" In the early months of the pandemic, Harvard's school of public health released a showing a link between fine particulate matter, also known as PM 2.5 pollution, and increased mortality rates from Covid-19. Terrell wanted to know what that meant for Louisiana, particularly in Cancer Alley. After scraping the raw data from the Harvard study and performing her own analysis, she found that the highest death rates from Covid-19 and a majority of PM 2.5 concentrations were in Cancer Alley. Ida added another layer of affliction by destroying houses and forcing residents to emergency shelters or relatives' homes, where they may be clustered together with potential for increased Covid-19 transmission. \"It seems like these communities are just continually burdened with risks that they didn't ask for, and don't deserve to be burdened with,\" Terrell said. The current 7-day average is more than 42 new Covid-19 cases per 100,000 in St. John and more than 177 new cases per 100,000 in St. James, according to . The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention categorizes St. John and St. James as a community with high levels of Covid-19 transmission. Taylor said he worries that residents who have been sickened by cancer as well as Covid-19 won't get the medical care they need after having to evacuate because of Ida's impacts. Some are being transported to shelters where they could potentially spread Covid-19 or even contract it, he said, echoing Terrell's concern. Prior to Ida, of residents in St. James Parish and St. John Parish were living below the poverty line, according to Census data. \"This is a mess,\" Taylor told CNN. \"I don't see how poor people are expected to survive this.\" The proliferation of petrochemical facilities and oil refineries throughout Cancer Alley has become a familiar sight to residents along the industrial corridor. Cayette said he remembers industrial facilities emerging after Category 4 Hurricane Betsy pummeled the region in 1965. But it was only recently that residents began to realize the invisible danger the industry caused on public health and the ironic effects it has on the climate. When a hurricane is barreling toward an industry-heavy region, petrochemical facilities and oil refineries typically begin to shutter their plants, which involves burning anywhere from hundreds to of hazardous materials. As part of emergency shutdown procedures, these facilities emit or burn various unprocessed chemicals and gases through a process known as flaring. Oftentimes, Yoder said, the emissions continue to escape even after the hurricane has knocked out power lines. \"This is not something new to these communities, and it's not necessarily even unique to a disaster situation,\" Terrell said of refineries emitting toxic compounds. \"It seems like consistently the people who are breathing these toxins are the last to find out about it.\" In St. Charles Parish, for instance, a Shell Norco manufacturing complex has been spewing residual gases as residents pick through the rubble of Hurricane Ida's aftermath. After the storm, the EPA contacted Shell about the excessive smoke and reports of noxious gas coming out of its refinery. In a report, that Shell is conducting \"community air monitoring\" and \"looking at all options to try to reduce emissions to flare.\" \"While the site is safe and secure, we are experiencing elevated flaring due to a lack of steam generation,\" Curtis Smith, a Shell spokesperson, told CNN. \"Crews are working around the clock to complete repairs and we are making good progress on minimizing flaring until power is restored.\" In St. James Parish, residents like Sharon Lavigne have been fighting new petrochemical plants attempting to set up shop in their community. Five years ago, Lavigne was diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis. Blood tests revealed that she had aluminum inside her body, which she later blamed on the slew of industrial facilities after attending a few environmental justice workshops. Angered by what she learned about the industry growing in her backyard, Lavigne founded RISE St. James, a faith-based environmental justice group trying to stop any new industrial development in Cancer Alley, which Cayette is also a member of. One of their was against the Taiwanese plastics manufacturer Formosa, which was set to build a in St. James Parish. Not only do Formosa's own that their mammoth facility could emit more of the cancer-causing compound than just about any other facility in the country, but their chosen location also happens to sit on two former 19th-century sugarcane plantations and a , according to a filed against the facility. \"My grandparents lived on this land. They bought this land and lived on it,\" Lavigne told CNN. \"And then when I got married, I built a house on this land.\" And while Formosa tried to push ahead with its construction during the pandemic, RISE St. James fought hard to block the company, delaying the construction further. The US Army Corps of Engineers early this year ordered Formosa to conduct a new environmental review of the petrochemical facility, thanks to legal complaints, protests and lawsuits like RISE St. James. While the battle to block the multibillion-dollar facility isn't over, Hurricane Ida added to the community's problems. The storm tore Lavigne's roof and caused her ceiling to collapse, just like it did to many other houses in the parish. \"So many of us suffered damages from Ida,\" Lavigne said, \"so after RISE members rebuild, we're going to help the rest of the community.\" Cancer Alley has faced many disasters, but none as challenging as a hurricane, air pollution and pandemic happening at once. To Cayette and Lavigne, living next to industrial facilities is a death sentence. It may take years for the community to recover, but Lavigne said they've been victorious before. As long as the fossil fuel industry continues to warm the planet and pollute their backyards, she said grassroots organizations will keep fighting. \"People tell me they're glad we're fighting the industry,\" she said. \"Many tell me they can't be out there to help me, but they're praying for me. That was nice.\""},

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Prediction Center on Tuesday forecast 14 to 21 named storms, six to 10 hurricanes and three to six major hurricanes -- of Category 3 strength or greater. The 2020 and 2021 seasons both exhausted the hurricane name list and broke records. No one can say for sure if this year will be similar, but in early April, , which were right in line with what NOAA is forecasting. The CSU forecast called for 19 named storms, nine hurricanes and four major storms. After back-to-back years of using all the hurricane names and resorting to the Greek alphabet, the World Meteorological Organization decided to do away with using the Greek alphabet and to be used if all the hurricane names are exhausted once again. Of course it's impossible to know how many of those storms will make landfall along the US coast, or where the largest storms will develop. However, during the announcement, NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad recognized that the current hurricane cycle for the Atlantic is a busy one. \"If you go back two years, the 2020 hurricane season broke records across the board and it's the most active season on record with 30 named storms,\" said Spinrad. \"The 2021 hurricane season, which is the third most active year on record in terms of names of storms brought us 21 named storms with impacts, ranging from the Appalachian Mountains all the way to New England, resulting in over $78.5 billion in US damage.\" There are several contributing factors that play into a \"busy\" hurricane season. \"We are in an active period,\" said Spinrad. \"There are certain ingredients that drive the intensity and the frequency of hurricanes.\" One is the existing in the equatorial Pacific. This phenomenon creates cooler-than-average ocean temperatures around the equator in the Pacific and results in weather impacts around the globe. La Ni\u00f1a presents favorable conditions for hurricanes -- in contrast to that of El Ni\u00f1o. Hurricane seasons under El Ni\u00f1o conditions are known for upper-level wind patterns across the Caribbean that tear hurricanes apart as they try to form, making the seasons less active. Another reason for the above-normal forecast is the location of what's called the \"Gulf Loop Current.\" This current is \"a 600-foot-deep river of hot Caribbean water that travels between Cancun, Mexico and western Cuba into the Gulf,\" said CNN meteorologist Chad Myers. This loop current is flowing farther north now, forcing warm water at deeper levels of the ocean to travel closer to the coastal areas along the Gulf of Mexico. \"The warm water is simply too deep and the hurricane has an unlimited supply of hot water for intensification,\" said Myers. Forecasters are comparing the position of the loop current with where it was placed in the record-breaking 2005 season -- when Hurricanes Katrina and Rita both made landfall. \"Yes, the loop current does look like 2005,\" said Matthew Rosencrans, lead hurricane season outlook forecaster with NOAA's Climate Prediction Center. \"But it depends if a storm actually moves over that loop current and forecasting the specific track of storms is not something we can do beyond a week time frame,\" Rosencrans added. During the 2021 hurricane season, eight storms made landfall along the US Gulf Coast and in 2020 six made landfall along the Gulf. In 2020, and both slammed into southwest Louisiana, making landfall roughly 15 miles apart. \"In 2021, ripped through Southeast Louisiana, then caused more . \"Hurricane Ida spanned nine states, demonstrating that anyone can be in the direct path of a hurricane and in danger from the remnants of a storm system,\" said FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell. \"It's important for everyone to understand their risk.\""},

We had several this year that brought , staggering to the mountains in the west, and even . An atmospheric river is a long, narrow region in the atmosphere that can transport moisture thousands of miles, like a fire hose in the sky. We talk a lot about them in the West because large-scale storm systems bring the region up to 40% of their yearly rainfall. But we started wondering: Is there anywhere else where these happen? Apparently, atmospheric rivers also occur in the eastern US, unleashing a river of moisture like what we will see this week. The reason East Coast atmospheric rivers aren't talked about much isn't because they are rare. In fact, they are quite common. \"Atmospheric rivers are more frequent on the East Coast than they are on the West Coast,\" said Jason Cordeira, Associate Professor of Meteorology at Plymouth State University. \"They're just not as impactful and don't usually produce as much rainfall.\" While Cordeira noted it is tough to give an exact number of how many atmospheric rivers impact the East every year, he says a rough estimate would be anywhere from 80-100 per year! WOW. The West gets about half that number of atmospheric rivers each year, yet they account for double the annual rainfall percentage. \"The West Coast is a much more arid climate. And they usually get precipitation during just half of the year,\" Cordeira pointed out. The East Coast accumulates its annual rainfall from several sources: afternoon storms, cold fronts and hurricanes, which can bring MUCH higher rain amounts than an atmospheric river. \"Some of the strongest atmospheric river events that are perfectly oriented, can produce 6-8 inches of rain,\" Cordeira reported. \"Those totals are dwarfed by the amount of rainfall that we can get from a hurricane.\" Some recent hurricanes such as , have resulted in rainfall totals measured in FEET, not inches. This week's atmospheric river won't leave the footprint Harvey did by any stretch, but it could affect the same areas as Harvey. The Deep South will once again be hit by a series of storms this week, along with the Plains, the Rockies and the Pacific Northwest. So, needless to say, this week's weather will be much more far-reaching. It has no doubt been a super active stretch of severe weather in the South and Southeast, as this is the fourth week in a row where active weather is affecting the same areas. However, as we get deeper into April and May, we should start to see the storm tracks shift a little farther north into what is traditionally, \"Tornado Alley,\" which is what we will begin to see this week. A series of storm systems will impact the US this week from coast to coast. It will bring everything from blizzard conditions to tornadoes to flash flooding, an exhausting week to say the least. The Storm Prediction Center (SPC) has placed a Level 3 out of 5 \"enhanced risk\" of severe weather today for central Arkansas, however, anywhere from San Antonio to the Ohio Valley could see storms today. The extreme northeast of Texas, southeast Oklahoma and western and central Arkansas, including Little Rock, are under a tornado watch until 11 p.m. CT Monday. Large hail -- possibly greater than baseball size -- and wind gusts to 70 mph are also a concern for the area. While this is happening in the central part of the country, a robust system will be entering the Pacific Northwest, and will crisscross the country in dramatic fashion today, bringing heavy rain to the coastal areas of Washington, Oregon and California, and several feet of snow for the Cascades. \"This system will deepen as it moves farther inland, setting the stage for an intense late season winter storm to impact the Rockies and Northern Plains,\" noted the Weather Prediction Center (WPC). \"Over a foot of snow is likely to accumulate between eastern Montana and central North Dakota on Tuesday.\" Blizzard warnings are in effect for portions of the Dakotas and Montana from Tuesday through Thursday. \"Total snow accumulations between 12 and 24 inches [are forecast],\" said the National Weather Service (NWS) office in Bismarck. \"Winds gusting as high as 50 mph [are also possible].\" The heavy snow and high winds will make travel nearly impossible for those areas due to whiteout conditions and will also create avalanche dangers. Many of the western mountain ranges have some sort of avalanche danger today, so be sure to check before heading out, especially in the backcountry. We wrote a story earlier in the season about what causes extreme avalanche dangers and why you only have about 15-30 minutes to be found alive after burial. Click to read more. After the system blankets the West with its late-season dump of snow, the storm will amplify as it heads east. It will combine with the available moisture provided by the atmospheric river we talked about and will result in the perfect setup for severe weather. The tornado threat will be even stronger for Tuesday and Wednesday in the midsection of the country. But the storms will be impacting areas much farther north than the previous rounds of severe weather we have seen during the last three weeks. Tuesday there is again a Level 3 out of 5 \"enhanced\" risk of severe storms from Dallas to Omaha, which includes more than 16 million people. While it is the area with the highest likelihood of storms, nearly 40 million people will have some possibility of seeing storms. \"Any thunderstorms that can develop in this very favorable thermodynamic environment will likely become severe quickly,\" the SPC advised. They mentioned any (strong thunderstorm) will be capable of producing tornadoes, saying \"some of the tornadoes could be strong.\" By Wednesday, we enter Day Three of this multiday severe event. The main threat area will shift east with the third day of a Level 3 out of 5 \"enhanced risk\" of severe weather. The bullseye will be from northern Louisiana to the south side of Chicago and include places like Shreveport, Little Rock, Memphis, St. Louis, and Indianapolis. \"Large to very large hail, damaging winds and tornadoes will all be possible,\" said the SPC. \"Strong tornadoes may occur.\" Dallas, Houston, New Orleans, and Chicago could all see storms as well. The good news is the severe threat will be over in time for Easter weekend. We could still see some lingering showers in the eastern half of the country, and some mountain snow in the Rockies, which could affect egg hunts and sunrise services. While things could change between now and then, right now the SPC doesn't have any areas highlighted for severe weather during Easter weekend as of now. As if severe storms and blizzard conditions weren't enough of a headline this week, extremely cold air will follow the front, plunging overnight temperatures into the single digits is forecast for portions of the northern Plains. \"Low temperatures in the single digits are possible and this could cause issues,\" said the NWS office in Billings. \"Do not be deceived by the sun, it is going to be fighting a very cold airmass.\" And as the climate crisis continues to change the dynamics of our weather, expect atmospheric rivers to become more intense as well. \"It's expected that as the air temperatures increase, the air can hold more water vapor and therefore any storms that are comprised of water vapor will have more of it,\" Cordeira explained. \"So, an atmospheric river, which is defined as a region of water vapor, will likely become more intense. Their frequency may not be more common, but their intensity could become larger.\" The drought-stricken West is getting even drier, according to the latest . \"Central Washington, Idaho, and northwest Montana also saw increases in drought extent or severity as short-term dryness continues to build upon long-term moisture deficits extending back to last year,\" according to the drought monitor. \"Many parts of southern Idaho, and the rest of the West, have set records for the driest three-month period (January to March) going back 100 years or more.\" Texas is also facing extreme drought with 95% of the state in some level of drought. At 26,000 square miles, Texas has more \"exceptional drought\" area than any other state, per the latest US Drought Monitor. The 26,000 square miles of exceptional drought is larger than the state of West Virginia (or more than three times the size of Massachusetts). The drought is only making fire conditions worse. From Texas to Kansas, there will be an extreme fire danger especially on Tuesday, as dry conditions and winds topping 50 mph will cover the area.

Is it quickest to get the train or the bus? What about a taxi or a city bike? Which provider has the nearest e-scooter? It can be inconvenient and time consuming. Which is why Finnish startup MaaS Global decided to aggregate all these services into one app called Whim. Available in more than 10 cities across Europe and Asia, users can access taxis, buses, bikes, e-scooters and rental cars. \"Whim's sole purpose is to compete against car ownership,\" CEO Sampo Hietanen tells CNN Business. According to the International Energy Agency, transport is responsible for , most of which come from . If Whim can persuade users to trade their car keys for a single app offering multiple transport options, the environmental impact could be enormous, says Hietanen. He admits this isn't an easy task. To succeed Whim has to be more convenient and cheaper than owning a car. \"The car represents freedom of mobility,\" says Hietanen \u2014 even if a city dweller barely uses it, they still keep it parked outside as a \"freedom insurance.\" To compete, Whim offers rental cars and taxis, but Hietanen says that users tend to opt for public transport or micromobility (shared lightweight vehicles such as bikes or e-scooters). Users can choose between multiple tiers of service, including a pay-as-you-go option and a 30-day season ticket, which costs \u20ac62 ($73) in Helsinki \u2014 where the app is most established \u2014 for unlimited public transport and short taxi rides. The ticket also offers car rental from \u20ac55 ($65) per day. While Helsinki has well-developed alternatives to driving, that's not true of everywhere. If a city \"does not have a wide public transport system or a lot of rental cars or taxis in place\" then it will be difficult to convince people to give up their cars, says Maria Kamargianni, associate professor of transport and energy at University College London. She says apps like Whim represent the first step in tempting people away from car ownership, and adds that the availability of alternative transport options is likely to improve as the market matures. Research firm predicts the global mobility service market will grow from $4.7 billion in 2020 to $70.4 billion by 2030. Other providers include Citymapper, which for Londoners in 2019, and Moovit, which launched an in Israel last year. Whim, launched in 2016, is one of the earliest providers and has raised more than $60 million from investors such as  ,  and Toyota Financial Services. It's available in several European cities and in Tokyo, and has racked up 18 million trips globally since launch. But the business has been hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, says Hietanen; with fewer people traveling, revenues are lower, stalling the company's expansion into other cities. Finnish newspaper recently reported that the company had spent \u20ac50 million ($59 million) on failed expansion ventures. Hietanen says the money was spent on integrating multiple transportation providers, establishing market readiness in several countries, and developing the complex technology that underpins the app. \"We've known from the beginning that the investment needed to create this would be substantial,\" he says, adding that the company has recently secured further investment. Though the industry is in its infancy, Hietanen is confident the demand will be there. A from the International Transport Forum (ITF) says that mobility services will be vital in meeting the needs of a growing world population and fast-paced urbanization. But for growth to happen, \"people must choose it over other travel options\" such as private motor vehicles. This is already happening, says Hietanen. According to a company survey carried out in Helsinki, 12% of its users said that Whim had prompted them to give up their cars. \"People want the more sustainable solution,\" he says, \"but they still want the freedom of being able to go anywhere, anytime.\""},

But despite covering more than of the Earth's surface, the ocean is still a relative mystery. In fact, we know more about the than we do about the sea floor; just over of the ocean bed has been mapped. Getting a fuller picture would enable us to navigate ships more safely, create more accurate climate models, lay down telecommunication cables, build offshore windfarms and protect marine species -- all part of what's known as the \"blue economy,\" projected to be worth by 2030. Underwater robotic vehicles equipped with sensors are helping gather that data quicker and more cheaply than ever before. But many of these vehicles rely on batteries with a limited lifespan, and need to return to a boat or the shore to recharge, making it difficult for them to map more remote parts of the sea. A five-year-old startup called is rising to the challenge, founded by oceanographer Yi Chao. While working at NASA, he developed technology to power ocean robots by harnessing \"the naturally occurring temperature difference\" of the sea, Chao told CNN Business. The power module can be installed on existing data-gathering robots or Seatrec's own floating device. This dives a kilometer down to examine the chemistry and shape of the seabed, using sonar to create a map of the surrounding area. The robot returns to the surface to send back its findings via satellite. As the float moves between colder and warmer parts of the ocean, material inside the module either melts or solidifies, causing pressure that in turn creates thermal energy and powers the robot's generator. \"They get charged by the sea, so they can extend their lifetime almost indefinitely,\" Chao said. A basic float model typically costs around $20,000. Attaching Seatrec's energy system adds another $25,000, Chao said. But the access to free, renewable energy and the ability to stay in the water longer makes data gathering up to five times cheaper in the long run, according to Chao. He said the startup is making fewer than 100 devices per year, primarily for marine researchers, but the technology is easily scalable -- Seatrec's energy module can also be can be retrofitted onto existing mapping devices to extend their range. New technologies that can extend the reach of data-gathering devices are crucial for mapping more remote parts of the deep sea, according Jamie McMichael-Phillips, director of the Nippon Foundation-GEBCO . \"One of the huge challenges we have is quite simply physics,\" said McMichael-Phillips. \"Unlike mapping the Earth's surface where we can use a camera [or] satellites, at sea, light does not penetrate through the water column. So we're pretty much limited to using sonar systems.\" Launched in 2017, the Seabed 2030 Project has increased awareness about the importance of the ocean floor, and given researchers and companies a clear goal to work towards: map the entire seafloor by the end of this decade. Some companies, such as , are surveying the ocean from the surface. Another startup, Bedrock Ocean Exploration, says it can provide surveys of seabed areas up to 10 times faster than traditional methods by using an autonomous electric submarine fitted with sonars, cameras and lasers; the data is then analyzed on Bedrock's own cloud platform. Even with the growing number of technologies accelerating seabed exploration, completing the map is still a logistical and financial challenge. Chao estimates that it would take 3,000 of Seatrec's floats operating over the next 10 years to fully survey the ocean. The company has raised in seed funding to scale up production of its energy harvesting system. But this is a drop in the ocean of the capital needed to fully survey the ocean, which is estimated to be \"somewhere between $3 to $5 billion,\" according to McMichael-Phillips -- \"pretty much the same order of magnitude as the cost of sending a mission to Mars.\" Bedrock's DiMare believes it's time we start investing in our own planet. \"If we want to keep Earth as a place that humans can live,\" he said, \"we have got to get a lot smarter about what's going on in the ocean.\""},

Spikes has plans to get the service up and running again \"on or around September 5th,\" according to its . Details remain scarce, but the company says the new MoviePass will have three pricing tiers that, depending on market, will cost $10, $20 or $30. \"Each level will get a certain amount of credits to be able to use towards movies each month,\" the website said. \"More details to come.\" Spikes helped found MoviePass before being pushed out in 2018 after selling the company to . He held a presentation in New York in February, during which he announced the relaunch and acknowledged \"a lot of people lost money, a lot of people lost trust\" after MoviePass went belly-up, according to . Rebuilding trust is just one of the many challenges MoviePass faces as it makes its return in the coming weeks. One of the biggest roadblocks is that MoviePass is coming back at arguably the worst possible time. Movie chains, including  , Regal and Alamo Drafthouse, have embraced their own versions of the subscription model that MoviePass ushered in. Trying to break into moviegoers' wallets this time around may be difficult. Consumers today might have a bit of subscription fatigue, considering the litany of streaming services and other bundles they pay for. Not to mention four-decade-high inflation, which has many Americans reining in discretionary purchases, such as going out to the movies. Even for those who have the cash to spend on something like MoviePass, the movie marketplace is wildly different than it was when the company last existed. The domestic box office is down 31% this year compared to the same point in 2019, prior to the pandemic. That's considerably better than 2021, but still not all the way back to \"normal.\" Although many moviegoers have returned to theaters, movies by and large haven't. The number of major releases \u2014 films that open in 2,000 or more theaters \u2014 is down a whopping 43% compared to 2019, according to  . Of course, there's still a lot of films being produced and released, but many are either being held up by or heading directly to streaming. For example, the next big blockbuster, \"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,\" won't be released until November. If the point of MoviePass is to allow movie lovers to see a lot of films on the cheap, the service only really makes sense if there are a lot of movies to see. In the summer of 2017, MoviePass caught fire with consumers with an irresistible \"too good to be true\" offer: $10 to see one movie a day for an entire month. The service rapidly grew to 3 million subscribers in less than a year. But MoviePass' business model was at best unsustainable \u2014 and at worst nonexistent. The company burned through cash and shut down two years after bursting on the scene. Now it's back, and the question around Hollywood is: will MoviePass, and its new leadership, finally achieve its Hollywood ending? Can it create a sustainable business that could change the movie landscape forever? Time will tell, but so far, the story of MoviePass is less \"show me the money\" and more \"the stuff dreams are made of.\""},

It's also India's oldest unicorn in the sector, having raised funds from investors such as Tiger Global and Accel, and has more than 50,000 customers. The company was last valued at $3.5 billion in a 2019 funding round, according to data firm Tracxn. Other Indian SaaS firms have found traction by focusing on niche businesses. , for example, is a unicorn that builds software for the spa and beauty salon industry. Of India's 10 SaaS unicorns, six reached that milestone in 2020, and investors around the world are paying attention. Last year, investors pumped $1.5 billion into Indian SaaS companies, four times more than in 2018 or 2019, according to the SaaSBoomi report. Investors are excited about SaaS because of the \"massive adoption\" of software over the last decade, according to Mohit Bhatnagar, managing director of Sequoia Capital India. While India is a in the global SaaS market, investors say the country could eventually dominate the sector because of two things: its vast pool of English-speaking developers, and the relatively low cost of hiring them. Thanks to the rise of India's IT industry, software engineering has become one of the most in the country. \"India actually has one of the largest developer communities in the world,\" Bhatnagar told CNN Business. Many of them have worked at some of the biggest global tech companies. Abhinav Asthana, the co-founder of Postman, pointed to his experience working as an intern at Yahoo in Bengaluru as instrumental in the decision to build his product. He came up with the idea to build a tool that would simplify the API (Application Programming Interface) testing process. An API is a programming code that defines how two applications communicate with each other, and Postman says it has made it easier for engineers to work together as they design and build their APIs. \"We saw how software was created at these global companies, and we saw API was a key problem,\" Asthana told CNN Business. Now, Postman is India's most valuable SaaS unicorn, with a valuation of $5.6 billion. The low cost of operating in India is a big plus. According to a report by  , the salary of entry-level developers in India is 85% less than their counterparts in the United States. \"If you are building a SaaS company in the US, it is better to have a million-dollar client rather than a $10,000-client because you need to pay for sales and marketing in that country,\" said Prasanna Krishnamoorthy, managing partner at SaaS accelerator Upekkha. \"When you are serving customers from India, you can have these small and mid-sized companies, as well as large ones.\" Most SaaS companies focus on global clients, similar to the strategy that was followed by India's IT giants such as TCS and  . Investors see this as a welcome change, since most of India's oldest unicorns \u2014 from Flipkart to Paytm \u2014 have focused primarily on the domestic market. Almost 98% of Fortune 500 companies use Postman's products, according to Asthana, while Freshworks' first client was based in Australia. SaaS firms are much better placed to go global than e-commerce companies like India's Flipkart, for example. They write software once, and then are able to use it multiple times. \"For a Flipkart you need billions of dollars [to grow internationally], but for a Freshwork you need much less capital to go global,\" said Mathrubootham, who is also an investor in Postman. This is because e-commerce firms require a ton of money to set up physical operations elsewhere \u2014 they have to hire delivery drivers, rent warehouses and buy inventory. Bhatnagar of Sequoia Capital said that Indian software entrepreneurs \"mastered\" the art of \"remote sales\" fairly early. \"Honestly, in this last two years, the whole world has had to understand how to do better remote sales,\" he added. Despite the euphoria, there are some hurdles Indian companies have to overcome before they can deliver on the $1 trillion promise. Indian engineers trained in the IT services industry may find it hard to develop the discipline required to build a product-focused company. In IT services, \"you are selling bodies and you say yes to everything the customer says,\" said Krishnamoorthy. SaaS companies, on the other hand, have to say no to 99% of [potential] customers, he added. And India's startup ecosytem is still relatively immature when compared to Silicon Valley. Despite the massive size of some homegrown unicorns, Mathrubootham said that the country does not have a \"global tech powerhouse product brand.\" But he hoped that future SaaS companies can change that. \"It is my personal dream to see India as a product nation,\" he added."},

Now, suddenly, HBO Max is starting to look a little different. The service, which like CNN is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery, has been as it cuts costs, shifts strategy and prepares to with Discovery+, its sister streaming service. So, what's going on? The media landscape is decidedly different from the early days of the pandemic, and HBO Max remains in flux. There's a myriad of reasons why HBO Max is removing shows like \"Generation,\" \"Infinity Train,\" \"Vinyl,\" and \"The Not-Too-Late Show with Elmo.\" But it breaks down to three key areas: cost-cutting, a shift in the overall content strategy and ridding the service of content that subscribers weren't watching. Just because content lives on a service doesn't mean that it's free after sunk costs. Streaming services still must pay residuals to casts and crews of a production, and those costs pile up. HBO Max will save \"north of $100 million annually\" after removing the shows, according to a source familiar with HBO's decision. Warner Bros. Discovery has told investors that it will cut , so every little bit helps. \"Keeping titles on a platform comes with a cost,\" Julia Alexander, director of strategy at Parrot Analytics, told CNN Business. \"Does a title bring in more value to the platform than its cost? If the answer is no, and especially if that title is a low engagement title, which many of these are, then removing titles can benefit a company's bottom line.\" Streaming has trained consumers to believe that everything will be available forever on a service, especially original content. That's not always the case. Other services pull content from their libraries too. It's a part of the business. \"As we work toward bringing our content catalogs together under one platform, we will be making changes to the content offering available on both HBO Max and Discovery+,\" a HBO Max spokesperson told CNN Business. \"That will include the removal of some content from both platforms.\" Nope, Big Bird is still alive. However, the company did reportedly pull Kids' programming is vital to the health of any streaming service, but it requires a big investment, according to Alexander. \"Being invested in kids programming, especially live-action, means being all in,\" she said. \"You can't just have a couple of shows and hope that suffices. It requires a multi-year plan.\" That goes for animated content as well, which has been on the chopping block at HBO Max lately. Even a new animated series based on , was scrapped. \"Right now, WBD's two main priorities are driving growth while cutting down on costs,\" Alexander said. \"Kids programming is an area that top players like  ,  ,  , and  are already invested in, while YouTube maintains the majority of that audience's attention.\" Ultimately, HBO Max wants to focus more on strengths like HBO's adult dramas and films at Warner Bros., but it will probably reinvest in children's content again at some point. Time will tell. David Zaslav, the new CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery, is focused on making money from traditional revenue streams like TV ad revenue, cable fees and box office totals as well as streaming. This is a shift from his predecessor, Jason Kilar, who bet that the future was in streaming and put most of WarnerMedia's eggs in that basket. The streaming world is evolving, and everyone is still figuring out its future. \"It's not a game of Kilar was right and Zaslav is wrong, or Zaslav is right and Kilar is wrong. It's a matter of prioritization,\" Alexander said. \"The future of streaming is still being determined, but it is fundamentally where everything is headed.\" Cable is declining while broadband is expanding and the future of streaming will not be one size fits all, she added. \"It's a premium service like HBO Max on top of free ad-supported platforms like Pluto TV, on top of licensing shows to other players in the streaming and linear space,\" Alexander said. \"And it's in conjunction with theatrical releases -- not a total replacement of it.\" Consumer choice will have a large part of deciding what the next era of streaming \u2014 and thus HBO Max \u2014 will be, she said, adding that \"the audience is, and always has been, king.\""},

She is not the only one. India has seen a huge boom in cryptocurrency trading since the start of the pandemic, even though authorities in Asia's third largest economy have for years expressed concerns about digital currencies, and even Entrepreneurs in the industry told CNN Business that the country has the potential to become a crypto superpower, since it is one of the hottest internet markets in the world, with , and hundreds of millions more yet to come online for the first time. India ranked second behind only Vietnam last year in a list of countries seeing the fastest growth in cryptocurrency adoption, according to a report published in October by blockchain data platform Chainalysis. While the government does not keep estimates of how many people trade cryptocurrencies, industry experts have suggested that the country may now have more than . The growth is driven by younger investors \u2014 mostly under the age of 35 \u2014 and many of them are coming from smaller cities and towns, founders of two of India's biggest crypto exchanges told CNN Business. According to Sumit Gupta, CEO and co-founder of exchange CoinDCX, many Indian millennials have started \"their investing journey with crypto.\" While 20 years ago, their parents chose to invest in gold, these youngsters \"are more interested in having bitcoin as part of their portfolio,\" Gupta told CNN Business, referring to the fact that traditionally Indians chose to park their money in gold or savings accounts. is both an investment and a cultural habit in India, which is one of the largest markets for the precious metal, according to the . It also considered auspicious by Hindus and Jains, and plays a fundamental role in many religious ceremonies. Mumbai-based CoinDCX became India's first crypto unicorn last year, achieving a valuation of $1.1 billion after raising money from investors such as Coinbase Ventures and B Capital Group. The company says 70% of its 10 million users are between the age of 18 and 34. Data shared by rival firm WazirX tell a similar story. WazirX also has over 10 million users, and called 2021 a \" \" for crypto trading in India. The company was acquired by , one of the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchanges, in 2019. Over 65% of its users are under the age of 35, according to a recent company report, and it has seen a \"700% increase in the number of participants from smaller cities like Guwahati, Karnal, Bareilly, thereby signaling the growing interest from rural and semi-urban areas.\" Pritish Kumawat, a crypto trader from a small town in the western state of Rajasthan, said that he now finds conversations about cryptocurrencies in almost every tea shop in his area. Often, the most engaged participants are college students, he said, adding that bitcoin's massive spike last year has fueled the frenzy in India. In November, bitcoin was trading at a record high of , but it has since fallen to around $43,000. In addition to bitcoin, meme currencies such as dogecoin and shiba inu are also popular among Indians, the WazirX report added. Apart from investors from smaller towns, both companies saw an increase of more than 1000% in the number of women users on their platforms, albeit on a small base. Gupta said that participation of crypto by Indian women has seen \"a massive upside\" in the past 18 months and is \"fairly high, fairly healthy, relative to equity markets.\" The company's data shows that 15% of their overall users are women \u2014 which is the as well. The excitement over crypto is rising in India despite the country's on-again, off-again relationship with digital currencies. The central bank has long expressed concerns that cryptocurrencies can be used for money laundering and to finance terrorism. A cryptically worded proposal posted on the Indian parliament website last year even suggested the government was exploring plans to \"prohibit all private cryptocurrencies in India.\" This year, however, started on a more cheerful note for enthusiasts. , the Indian government announced it would impose a 30% tax on income from virtual digital assets, which many industry experts took as a sign that crypto trading won't be banned after all. The government also said it would launch a digital rupee in the coming months. \"Taxation of virtual digital assets or crypto is a step in the right direction. It gives much-needed clarity and confidence to the industry,\" Gupta said at the time of the announcement. Siddharth Menon, the co-founder of WazirX, told CNN Business that following the announcement, his platform saw daily sign-ups jump by over 50%. He also noticed rising interest among Indian developers and other professionals in joining the crypto industry. \"I'm getting LinkedIn messages\" from senior executives in India, who are now more optimistic about the business, he said. In the past, Indian exchanges have struggled to hire and retain experienced people due to the lack of clear regulations. But the Indian government soon put a damper on the mood, by clarifying that the cryptocurrencies are not yet legal in the country. \"I am not doing anything to legalize it or ban it or not legalize it,\" Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in parliament a few days after announcing the tax rate. \"Banning or not banning will come subsequently ... But I will tax because it is a sovereign right.\" \"I think the government is not entirely sure what it wants to do from a policy perspective,\" said Anirudh Rastogi, founder of tech law firm Ikigaw Law, which works with crypto exchanges in India. \"It knows where it wants to land broadly. It wants to find the right balance where it is not disconnected from the global progress in blockchain and other tech, but it wants to also address concerns regarding cryptocurrency.\" Rastogi added that the \"extraordinarily high\" tax on crypto is a short-term fix, which will also acts as a deterrent to many investors. \"This rate is typically used to tax activities that are not considered economically productive, such as lottery,\" he said. \"So this could be an indication that the government wants to make revenue, but it does not see crypto trading as economically productive.\" For equities, India applies a 15% short-term capital gains tax if shares are sold in less than a year, and 10% if sold after a year. Gupta hopes that the government makes up its mind soon. India, with its vast pool of developers and enthusiastic young population, could be a \"superpower in the next five to 10 years,\" in cryptocurrency and blockchain industry, he said. \"What is missing right now is a clear regulatory framework,\" he added."},

Traders don't have a crystal ball to measure the level of risk when they make investment decisions. Instead they depend on the VIX, or the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index. Known as Wall Street's \"fear gauge,\" the index is supposed to reflect the market's estimate of future volatility \u2014 or how fast prices will change \u2014 30 days out. An elevated VIX means increased fear and risk while a low VIX means the market is entering a less stressful period. That's why the VIX tends to move in the opposite direction of the market. But as investors churn through increasingly choppy markets, some analysts are worried that this trusted measure of forecasting is broken. The gauge, they say, doesn't work in an atmosphere heavy with uncertainty, which is when traders most need it. The VIX is worthless in forecasting the direction of stocks, Aaron Anderson, senior vice president of research at Fisher Investments told me. \"There's just no correlation to future returns. We've never understood why so many people accredit so much to the VIX.\" Markets have tumbled over the last four days, bringing the recent late-summer comeback into doubt. The VIX is just now catching up to that, and only sort of. : Thirty is considered a high benchmark for the VIX. The index floated around 20 and below \u2014 which would indicate less volatility \u2014 for most of August. It hit 25 on Wednesday. In theory, if the index were to predict future market moves, it would have risen that high ahead of last week's selloff, Scott Bauer, CEO of Prosper Trading Academy who worked for 15 years as a market maker at the CBOE, told me. Cliff Asness of AQR Capital Management agrees that the index has limited utility: \"The VIX tells us almost nothing beyond how much markets have been bouncing around lately \" In an analysis dating back to the 1990s he found that the VIX was essentially in line with the S&P 500. By the time an investor looks back and determines a VIX peak or trough, said analysts at Fisher Investments, they've likely already missed the corresponding turn in the S&P 500. Sometimes there isn't any connection at all. Fisher analysts pointed to 1995 \u2014 a stellar year for markets that had no correlation to the VIX. The index wasn't designed to be as useful to retail investors as it is for institutions, said Bauer. There's a whole cottage industry of derivatives built off it. When the CBOE first created the VIX in 1992, it was intended to be a way for traders to make money by predicting market volatility. It wasn't supposed to become the major fear gauge it is today. In uncertain times, we like to cling to any future reassurances that we can, and the financial media certainly likes to use the VIX to that end. But when the unknowns are unknown, the VIX tends to break down.  had a very bad Wednesday. The company announced that it will lay off about 20% of corporate employees, close around 150 stores and slash several of its in-house home goods' brands in a bid to rescue itself from bankruptcy, . The retailer announced that it had also managed to secure more than $500 million in financing to shore up its long-term financial problems. The stock closed down more than 20% lower on the news. That's a big shift from recent weeks when the long-ailing company was adopted by so-called meme investors, who use social media platforms to organize large-scale stock purchases. The meme-induced hype lifted Bed Bath and Beyond's shares from less than $5 at the beginning of August to more than $30 during the middle of the month. It's been volatile since then. Shares of BBBY have either been the best or worst-performing stock in the S&P 1500 on nine out of the last 12 trading days, according to an analysis by Bespoke Investment group. Over on Reddit, meme investors who frequent pages like WallStreetBets appeared confused about what to do next. Some begged fellow Redditors to hold the stock, while others said it was time to let go. But it appears that even meme investors eventually got pulled down with the sinking ship. The company's moves on Wednesday were the \"prototypical rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic,\" said Berna Barshay, an independent retail analyst.

His plans went awry", "paragraphs": " As Covid-19 wreaked havoc around the world last year, the 39-year-old son of an Indian billionaire was laying the groundwork for a plan he hoped would eventually end the pandemic. Adar Poonawalla \u2014 the CEO of Serum Institute of India (SII), the world's largest vaccine maker \u2014 pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into his Indian manufacturing facility and committed to make millions of doses of a then-unproven coronavirus vaccine. That vaccine, created by Oxford University and  , was still in clinical trials at the time. Nobody was sure how long a vaccine would take to develop, let alone whether it would even work. \"It was a calculated risk,\" Poonawalla told CNN Business. \"But I didn't see the choice at that time, to be honest. I just felt I'd regret not committing one way or another.\" To make his plan work, Poonawalla first had to raise nearly $1 billion. And the lives of hundreds of millions of the planet's most vulnerable people were at stake, since SII had pledged to provide poorer countries with jabs. If the gamble paid off, Poonawalla would save countless lives and be hailed as a hero during a period of historic turmoil. His fabulously rich family also would stand to grow even more wealthy by profiting from a significant deal. As the world gave its money \u2014 and trust \u2014 to Poonawalla, things seemed to be going according to plan. The AstraZeneca vaccine received approval from UK regulators in December 2020, and Poonawalla became a household name in India. But soon it became evident how badly Poonawalla had miscalculated the challenges that come with distributing millions of vaccines in the middle of a once-in-a-century pandemic. His company's ability to inoculate even his own countrymen was thrown into doubt earlier this year as a devastating wave of coronavirus hit India. He's also failed to keep up with his commitment to deliver shots to other nations \u2014 the consequences of which have dented his reputation and shed light on the perils of such heavy reliance on one manufacturer. It's easy to see why some of the biggest names in public health chose to rely on Poonawalla. Few manufacturers can come close to the scale at which SII is able to produce vaccines. The company \u2014 which was founded by Poonawalla's father, Cyrus, 55 years ago \u2014 produces 1.5 billion vaccines each year for measles, rubella, tetanus and many other diseases. The jabs are mainly distributed to low-income countries worldwide, including India. Poonawalla estimates that just over 50% of the world's babies depend on vaccines made at SII. The Poonawalla family charted an unusual path to becoming one of the world's preeminent vaccine makers. They have bred and raced thoroughbred horses since the 1940s, diversifying into pharmaceuticals, finance and real estate over the last half-century. Cyrus Poonawalla is now India's seventh-richest man, worth more than $16 billion, according to the His son Adar took over as CEO in 2011 and has focused on expanding in . To prepare for the AstraZeneca vaccine production, Poonawalla said he spent $800 million on buying chemicals, glass vials and other raw materials, as well as ramping up manufacturing capacity at his plant in the Western Indian city of Pune. More than $250 million came from the company's own funds. Another $300 million came from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which SII with to provide discounted or free doses to low-income countries. The rest was paid by other countries once SII started accepting orders for vaccines. In total, SII agreed to make up to 200 million vaccine doses for as many as 92 countries, as part of its deal with the Gates Foundation and Gavi, a vaccine alliance. All of that happened, though, before regulators signed off on the AstraZeneca vaccine. Had trials for that vaccine been unsuccessful, SII would \"just be making batches and then end up throwing them away,\" Poonawalla said. A business studies graduate of London's University of Westminster, Poonawalla said SII was able to make that decision more swiftly than many other companies, since it is a family-run business. \"The flexibility of being able to decide on the spot very quickly was really the main game-changer that enabled us to be able to do this,\" said Poonawalla, whose office in India is a refurbished . After the vaccine, Poonawalla began supplying doses to Indians and other other countries. By May, Gavi had received some 30 million jabs from SII. But Poonawalla's plans soon went awry when a second wave of Covid-19 hit India in the spring. At its peak the country was reporting over per day, though say the actual number was likely much higher. At that point, only percent of India's 1.3 billion population was fully vaccinated, and the country's national government had been slow in placing orders for more vaccines. Without a massive stockpile, states in India began to run out of the limited number of jabs they had. India then decided to the export of all vaccines, preventing SII from keeping up with its commitments elsewhere. \"I've always been a patriot for my country ... and if my country needs my facility first, I have to do what they say,\" Poonawalla said. \"There was no two ways about that.\" The inability to export vaccines hurt some of the poorest nations in the world. The director of Africa's disease control body, for example, warned India's hold on exports could be \" \" for the continent. People in several countries, from neighboring Nepal to , were left stranded after receiving the first dose of Covishield, the name of the India-manufactured vaccine. When asked why the global vaccine alliance chose to rely so heavily on one manufacturer, a Gavi spokesperson told CNN Business it had few options. At the start of 2021, \"very few vaccines were approved and available for deployment,\" the spokesperson said, adding that it was \"natural\" that SII would be contracted for early doses given its size. But public health expert Jeffrey Lazarus said there were flaws in the plan. \"Relying on one manufacturer was a mistake, which is easier to see in hindsight,\" said Lazarus, who heads the health systems research group at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health. While Poonawalla cannot be held responsible for some of the issues that led to the vaccine rollout stalling \u2014 chief among them, India's massive outbreak \u2014 his detractors have questioned parts of his approach. They point out Poonawalla hasn't delivered the number of jabs he initially promised, and they claim he hasn't been transparent about how he's been using all of the money he raised for the big vaccine push. \"There isn't much accountability for where the money he raised went,\" Malini Aisola, co-convenor of health sector watchdog All India Drug Action Network, told CNN Business. In June last year, it would make one billion doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine for low and middle income countries, with 400 million doses ready by the end of 2020. But by January 2021, the company had a stockpile of just . His critics weren't impressed, given the amount of capital he raised last year. The global media coverage also turned , with linking the global shortfall in vaccines to SII's problems, including the India export ban and a fire at the company's Pune facility. At the time Poonawalla said the fire had on Covishield production. But he has since saying that the incident has played a major role in hampering manufacturing. He also insists he was realistic about his goals. \"We always underpromise,\" Poonawalla told CNN Business, when asked whether the company pledged more than it could deliver. Still, he's been dogged by other controversies that have dented his reputation. As India's Covid-19 cases were skyrocketing in April, Poonawalla lowered the price of his vaccine and referred to the move as a \" \" \u2014 leading to heavy criticism, with activists pointing out that even a small profit is still a profit for SII. \"AstraZeneca has pledged that it won't from low income and middle income countries during the pandemic, but that does not seem to apply to SII,\" Aisola said. According to AstraZeneca, the companies the drugmaker has sublicensing agreements with, including SII, dictate their own prices. SII declined to comment on how much it has profited from the vaccine efforts so far, but Poonawalla said it is a \"very unreasonable and naive way of looking at the world\" for people to expect companies not to profit from the vaccine. While Poonawalla has yet to match his lofty goals, there is a chance that he and SII can get back on track, which is critical to ending vaccine inequality worldwide. India has decided to begin exporting vaccines once again as its own rate of inoculation increases. The nation had administered doses by October \u2014 about 90% of which came from SII, according to the company. SII also says that it has increased its production to 220 million doses a month as of October. SII is also expanding its partnerships, having signed a deal with American biotech firm Novavax to manufacture its Covid-19 vaccine, which is awaiting regulatory approvals. It's also partnering with the Russian Direct Investment Fund on production of the Sputnik vaccine."},

Joseph Bonner of Argus noted that although Zoom shares are well off their pandemic peaks, the company still would be tough to swallow \u2014 even for a megacap tech with tons of cash. \"A Zoom acquisition is unlikely due to a number of factors,\" Bonner said in an email. \"The thesis in favor of acquisition would be to pick up the asset on the cheap since it's lost so much value in the past year. Still at a $24 billion market cap, it's not that cheap and an acquisition premium would push that toward $30 billion or more.\" Bonner thinks that price tag would likely scare off any big tech buyers, as would the possibility of any potential deal getting a tough review from regulators in Washington. However, Bonner said there's a chance that Zoom could be bought by an investment firm so that it would no longer be subject to the quarterly earnings report whims of Wall Street. \"Think private equity. That could be a possibility,\" Bonner said. Others point out that Zoom is hardly the only tech/software company that is dealing with a post-Covid hangover. The Nasdaq has plummeted due to worries about rising interest rates and recession fears as well. \"I don't think it's accurate to say Zoom is uniquely struggling right now,\" said Morningstar analyst Dan Romanoff in an email. \"All of software has been battered over the last 10 months.\" Romanoff added that Zoom is \"an innovative company with a great product.\" The problem, he said, is that at the height of the pandemic, Zoom was \"generating an unsustainable revenue trajectory\" and the stock was \"sharply overvalued.\" That said, a deal could be possible. Romanoff noted that a Slack-Zoom combination could make sense. \"I thought a couple years ago that Slack and Zoom should merge because there is no need for standalone video, phone, and messaging products,\" Romanoff said. But he's not sure Salesforce would want to buy Zoom after already paying up for Slack, noting that Salesforce has \"maintained that [it is] not looking to do further large deals at this time.\" There is one other possible wild card though Business software company Oracle. \"Oracle doesn't have anything like this in their portfolio and they have been serial acquirers over the years,\" Romanoff said. But he still thinks an  deal for Zoom is highly unlikely because he's \"not sure that their balance sheet would allow them to do such a deal or that they are in the market at all.\" Romanoff added that if any tech company wanted to make a bigger bet on video, a cheaper way to do so would be with communications software firm  , which has a market value of just a little more than $4 billion. Zoom could also look to go back out and make a deal of its own if market conditions improve. That could help the company diversify. \"I am in the camp that Zoom is more likely to be an acquirer than an acquiree at this point,\" said James Fish, an analyst with Piper Sandler. Zoom had actually hoped to make a big purchase recently when it cloud call contact software firm  in July 2021. But Zoom called off the deal just two months later, and CEO Yuan said that \"financial discipline is foundational to our strategy.\""},

In a statement to CNN Business, Nvidia said it was working with \"customers in China to satisfy their planned or future purchases with alternative products and may seek licenses where replacements aren't sufficient.\" AMD, which is also headquartered in California, told CNN Business it had also been given new requirements by the US Department of Commerce that will hit shipments of its MI250 integrated circuits to China. \"At this time, we do not believe that shipments of MI100 integrated circuits are impacted by the new requirements,\" it said, referring to another line of components. \"We do not currently believe it is a material impact on our business.\" The new rules are a reminder of how US-China tensions remain high over business and tech. Last week, between the two countries on auditing US-listed Chinese companies had suggested a breakthrough in relations, but experts the deal will do little to resolve other key issues.

Traditionally, airlines and cruise ships have relied on satellites in far-distant areas of Earth's orbit \u2014 a place called geosynchronous orbit, where objects orbit at the same speed the Earth turns, allowing one satellite to blanket a specific area with connectivity. The problem is because the satellites are so far away, those services have high latencies, which translates into frustrating lag times. SpaceX's service is different, relying on thousands of satellites orbiting much closer to Earth that all work in tandem to beam internet to the ground. Eventually, SpaceX hopes to blanket the entire planet in connectivity using as many as 30,000 satellites. Nearly 3,000 are already working in orbit. But Royal Caribbean International has relied on a different internet service with satellites orbiting closer to the ground than geosynchronous satellites but still higher than SpaceX's. The prior deal was with a company called O3b, a Starlink competitor that began launching its satellites in 2013. (O3b has since been acquired by geosynchronous satellite operator SES.) \"Royal Caribbean International remains a customer of ours, and we look forward to continuing to grow and evolve our partnership in the coming years,\" SES told CNN Business via email, adding that their contract with Royal Caribbean has never been exclusive and \"competition is good as it drives the industry to develop innovative experiences.\" SpaceX's service so far has gained its fans and critics.

More should follow suit", "paragraphs": " One year ago, the world collapsed for Sayed Kabir Kamall, an Afghan of Uzbek heritage. Kabir had worked in procurement for the US embassy in Afghanistan and, in his spare time, was a popular musician, recording music in support of the Afghan military. But by August 15, , and the next day, Kabir gathered his wife and their two children to make a desperate dash for the US-controlled airport. \"They were shooting from the back of us...telling us to stop. But we didn't stop,\" Kabir told us. He and his family were among the lucky ones \u2014 they are four of the more than 76,000 Afghans who have been to the United States after Kabul fell last year. Resettlement agencies have undertaken Herculean efforts to help Afghans like Kabir and his family find housing, enroll children in school and provide English-language training. They have been joined by local churches, community groups and families from Texas to California to Virginia, opening their arms in inspiring ways to their new neighbors. But the single most important step in the journey of a refugee is landing a job, and yet, many of them are still struggling to do so. They might lack English fluency; have resumes with work experiences, certifications or company names that are unfamiliar to hiring personnel; or face transportation challenges due to the fact that they lack drivers' licenses. Companies need to step up to lower barriers for Afghans (and other refugees) to work \u2014 both to provide decent jobs, and to offer a ladder from entry-level work to jobs that reflect their backgrounds and qualifications. Ultimately, refugees want a hand up, not a handout. Securing decent work is the moment that refugees find the dignity of providing for themselves and their families, and when they can begin to put down roots in their new community. Thankfully, since the start of this year, the situation has improved, with companies embarking on dedicated efforts to . At , a global nonprofit focused on integrating refugees into the economy and their new communities, we have recruited more than 100 major companies to reduce barriers for trying to enter the US workforce. created a dedicated portal for refugees of all backgrounds to ensure that they were not overlooking resumes from qualified candidates. Tyson Foods hired Dari and Pashto interpreters at select sites to assist Afghan refugee employees. And Oneida Nation Enterprises arranged shuttle buses for Afghans without transportation so they could get to and from work. Thanks to efforts like these, many thousands of Afghans have now found decent jobs in the US, including Kabir. On April 11, he started as a procurement associate at Pfizer. It's a new start for Kabir. As he puts it, \"Now I am rebuilding my life from the zero point.\" While the tight labor market has helped open employers to alternative sources of talent, many corporate executives say they have also been in awe of refugees' courage and resilience. Companies are also seeing firsthand that hiring refugees makes good business sense. Data shows that stay at companies longer, that companies hiring refugees are more attractive across the board, and that consumers are more likely to purchase from brands hiring . One year on, we estimate that more than half of the Afghan refugees seeking employment have found a job; but that means there is still much work to do. Many more companies need to step up to hire Afghan refugees \u2014 making modest investments to overcome language, transportation and other barriers. And while entry-level jobs in sectors like hospitality, food services and retail are absolutely critical for providing refugees with the opportunity to make a living, improve their English and learn the soft skills of navigating the American workplace, these jobs must be the start, not the end-point of their professional journey. Through mentorship, training and career advancement opportunities, companies must do more to help Afghans grow into jobs that make the most of their skills. Congress has a huge role to play, too. It should urgently pass the , which would provide Afghan evacuees a streamlined path to in the United States. Without this legislation, many Afghans will need to apply for asylum on an individualized basis \u2014 an arduous task given that many of them had to destroy the very that could prove their claims. What's more, with an asylum of almost 700,000 cases, thousands of Afghans could be left in prolonged limbo for years, putting their ability to maintain continued lawful employment at risk. Despite all that has happened, Kabir thanks destiny for bringing him to America. We can't let him down."},

Air travel has been slow to adopt clean energy, but while the next generation of aviators waits for commercial airlines to move away from fossil fuels, it doesn't mean they can't train with lower carbon emissions. The Velis Electro, the world's only electric plane fully certified and , is taking off as a greener option for trainee pilots. Manufactured in Slovenia by Pipistrel, the Velis Electro is a two-seater light aircraft designed for flight schools. The single-engine aircraft can fly up to and has a maximum speed of (113 mph). It has a flight time of around 50 minutes (plus reserve) per charge, with two batteries that take to completely recharge. Tine Toma\u017ei\u010d, chief technology officer at Pipistrel Slovenia, says that while the Velis Electro offers a range of advantages over regular aircraft, a key attraction is that many of the fundamentals remain the same. \"You can literally take this airplane home and use it from day one for whatever you were using other non-electric powered airplanes for before,\" he tells CNN Business. As well as producing no carbon emissions in the air, the airplane is quiet \u2014 around says Pipistrel, which is . Toma\u017ei\u010d says that as a result, it can fly at much smaller airfields \u2014 which are often nearer to built-up areas and closer to prospective pilots \u2014 without annoying nearby residents. Since it was launched in 2020, Pipistrel says it has sold around 100 of the electric planes, priced at \u20ac175,000 ($175,500). With surging gasoline prices and increased scrutiny of the carbon footprint of air travel there is growing interest in the segment. in northern Sweden has three Velis Electros as part of its private and commercial pilot license training programs, which use sustainably powered planes where possible. Around 30% of the flying hours required for a commercial pilot's license take place in the electric aircraft, Johan Norberg, head of flight training at the academy, tells CNN. There is \"a huge difference\" in operational energy cost, he says, estimating a 40-minute flight in the Velis Electro uses $2 to $3 of renewable electricity, compared to roughly $45 of aviation gasoline for the same flight in a traditional single-engine training aircraft, like a Cessna 172, using a Lycoming O-360 engine. Pipistrel says batteries need to be replaced after around 2,000 flight hours (an indicator on the batteries says exactly when) and the price for a new pair is approximately $20,000. Even with the cost of replacing batteries, Norberg estimates the electric aircraft is cheaper to run than the academy's diesel counterpart, although he adds that \"the long-term operational costs are still to be verified.\" Training for a private pilot's license costs ($14,500) at Green Flight Academy, about the same as at flight schools that use conventional aircraft. \"When we can do a larger portion of training in electric airplanes there will be a significant cost cut to the whole training program,\" explains Norberg. In addition to shorter flights, qualifying for a private license requires pilots to undertake two-hour flights, says Norberg, which aren't currently possibly in the Velis Electro. But developing the next generation of electric aircraft with longer flight times could mean that within a few years, pilots might be able to train entirely without burning fossil fuel. Pipistrel was acquired this year by American conglomerate (owner of the Cessna and Lycoming brands), and is now part of . The global electric aircraft market is expected to quadruple , according to market research firm Precedence Research -- which estimates the value could reach nearly $40 billion by the end of the decade. The Velis Electro is currently awaiting approval for commercial use in the US by the Federal Aviation Administration, but it is already being flown privately. While trainee pilots are now getting the opportunity to fly green, large aircraft have yet to be weaned off fossil fuels, and zero-carbon long-haul and cargo flight is a way off. But Toma\u017ei\u010d is hopeful that won't always be the case. \"What (the) Velis Electro is already doing today is training the generation of pilots who will fly these large green aviation products of the future,\" he says. \"Not only is it representing a change in technology applied to training, but it is definitely changing the mindset of future pilots who inevitably will want to fly cleaner, electrified airplanes as part of their pilot careers.\""},

US employers announced just 20,485 layoffs in August, the lowest year-to-date total since 1993, according to data released Thursday from outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. A separate report from the Labor Department revealed that initial jobless claims for the week ended August 27 fell to 232,000, a drop of 5,000 from the previous week's level, which was revised downward by 6,000 claims. Initial claims are now at their lowest level in two months. Recent employment data, including the July jobs report and labor turnover survey have also defied analysts' and economists' expectations that the labor market would cool down after it neared its recovery from the pandemic and as the Federal Reserve took extreme measures to tame inflation and squelch demand. In July, employment growth was expected to slow to around 250,000 jobs, with the number of open positions falling to 10.5 million.

The hot job market complicates matters even further for the Federal Reserve, which views the current ratio of two job openings for every job seeker as a potential driver of higher wages that, in turn, can lead to higher prices and keep inflation elevated. Friday's federal jobs report will be closely watched for signs that employment growth is slowing. Economists estimate that about 300,000 jobs will be added in August, a considerable drop from July and the lowest monthly gain since April 2021. The August jobs report is due out Friday morning.  have dominated business headlines recently -- and while that could be an indication of fissures within the broader market, it is also representative of company- or industry-centric developments, said Ron Hetrick, senior labor economist for labor market analytics firm Lightcast. The bulk of those announcements have come from technology and tech-adjacent companies that scaled up their workforces to handle the sudden demand for their services during the pandemic. \"Things are cooling off again, and so those industries are going to have to [scale back] on the hiring that they did,\" he said. As the pandemic eases, other industries are seeing more demand. People have returned to vacationing, eating at restaurants and spending in other service areas that they couldn't access as easily during much of 2020 and 2021. That shift has led to weakness for some businesses, said Gus Faucher, senior vice president and chief economist with The PNC Financial Services Group. \"That being said, demand is still strong in the economy; many businesses are still short-staffed. So for workers who are laid off, it's fairly easy for them to find new jobs.\" Less than one in three unemployed workers has been jobless for 15 weeks or more, , a level not seen since before the Great Recession, other than a brief blip in mid-2020 when the labor market began to surge after the pandemic lockdowns eased. In some areas of the country, labor shortages are weighing heavily on businesses. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis found, after that most respondents said they planned to continue hiring over the next six months, 10% said they were cutting jobs, and those that were holding steady conveyed anxiousness about being able to keep the workers they had. Businesses in states such as Maryland, Virginia and North Carolina are also keeping a closer eye on their staffing levels, according to the Richmond Federal Reserve \u2014 but few are making cuts, said R. Andrew Bauer, a vice president and regional executive, during a recent . \"What they're more likely to do is, should a position come open, they're going to be slower to fill that position in anticipation for what may come,\" he said. There are some systemic challenges to closing the labor shortage gap. The size of the labor force is slightly below its pre-pandemic level, and the labor force participation rate has been on a decline since the early 2000s, when it was around 67%, and dropping to just above 62% in July. Economists had expected that percentage to grow as the economy added back jobs; however, it has actually fallen this year. \"Those 4 or 5 percentage points represent a couple million people that we would really be needing,\" said Hetrick. Economists continue to chew on who these missing workers are and what is keeping them out of the workplace, including lack of child care, health-related concerns, potentially restrictive immigration policies, and early retirements that fast-forwarded a demographic movement that has been decades in the making. There are also plenty of unknowns, including the influence of discouraged or marginally attached workers or those who are suffering lingering or chronic effects from Covid-19. A recent study from the Brookings Institution estimated that \"Long Covid\" . Despite broader economic uncertainty, the scales remain heavily tipped toward the worker, said Bonnie Dowling, an associate partner at business consultancy firm McKinsey. \"If you're in a market where it's I think it's hard to say that is anything but a seller's market,\" she said. Dowling was a co-author on a recent McKinsey report that sought to address the stark shortage in workers and what may be keeping younger employees on the sideline. Aspects such as workplace flexibility, meaningful work and compensation were cited as some of the key wants, according to the report. \"I don't think that many of them will come back into the labor market ,\" she said. \"And if they come in with that promise, and they aren't met, they've made it clear they're willing to leave again.\" \"We have to fundamentally rethink how we're working,\" she added."},

BA.4 and BA.5 are the dominant variants in the United States, causing an average of 91,000 new infections each day. \"These are vaccines that are made, manufactured and delivered identically to the Covid mRNA vaccines that most of us have already gotten,\" said Dr. Gregory Poland, who leads the vaccine research group at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. \"In a sense, you've just changed the blueprints.\" Having twice the blueprints doesn't mean you're getting twice the dose of active ingredients, though. \"The total mRNA content -- the business part of the vaccine -- that leads to the immune response is the same amount,\" said Dr. William Gruber, senior vice president of vaccine research and development at Pfizer, which makes one of the updated vaccines. Pfizer's booster is a 30-microgram dose that contains 15 micrograms of mRNA against the ancestral strain and 15 micrograms against the BA.4 and BA.5 variants. It is authorized for people as young as 12. The company is also retooling its shots for children ages to 5 through 11 and will ask the FDA for authorization of those updated boosters in early October. It's working with the FDA to update vaccines for children ages 6 months through 4 years. Moderna's bivalent booster is a 50-microgram dose, with 25 micrograms of mRNA designed to fight the ancestral strain of the coronavirus and 25 micrograms of mRNA designed to fight the BA.4 and BA.5 variants. It's authorized for people age 18 and older. The government has already been taking orders for these vaccines, and now that the FDA has authorized them, millions of doses will ship to tens of thousands of sites across the country. These include community health centers, health departments and pharmacies. As with past Covid-19 vaccines, these shots will be available free of charge. But they may be some of the last Covid-19 freebies from the government, which has said it's going to start commercializing treatments and vaccines this fall. Pfizer says it has the capacity to ship up to 15 million doses by September 9. Meanwhile, a panel of experts that advises the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on its vaccine recommendations will review the science behind the shots. At a meeting Thursday, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices will consider who should get the shots and when people should get them. If the committee votes to recommend them and CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky signs off, people can start getting the shots right away. \"What I'm expecting is, after CDC action, you'll start seeing some places start giving some shots in arms over the weekend, but very relatively few because [of the] Labor Day weekend. And my expectation is over next week, or certainly over the next 10 days, you're going to start seeing these bivalent vaccines become widely available across the country,\" Dr. Ashish Jha, who leads the White House Covid-19 Response Team, told CNN. The Biden administration expects appointment availability to ramp up over the first several days, with broad availability in a few weeks. People will be able to find locations at . The government is also preparing to launch a campaign that will urge Americans to get their annual flu shot along with an updated Covid-19 booster. Research on this approach suggests that it's safe. The updated Covid-19 inoculations will be the only game in town when it comes to boosters, at least for those 12 and up. The FDA says the older boosters are no longer authorized for this age group but will still be available as boosters for children ages 5 to 11. These are the first Covid-19 vaccines that will be authorized for use in people after being tested only in mice. This is much the same process that's followed each year when annual flu shots are updated. The FDA allowed companies to submit data from animal tests in order to speed these shots to the public. Studies in people are underway, according to Pfizer's Gruber. Dr. Peter Marks, who directs the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said he expects that it will be a month or two before data on humans is available. Officials say urgency with these boosters is warranted going into the fall, when Covid-19 is still circulating at high levels and influenza is expected to make a return. But the decision to rely on animal studies has generated some controversy. Some vaccine experts feel that animal studies don't provide sufficient evidence for these vaccines at this stage in the pandemic. \"You're asking people to get a new product for which there's no data,\" Dr. Paul Offit, who directs the vaccine education center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told CNN. \"Mice data are not adequate to launch 100-plus-billion-dose effort.\" Offit says it makes sense to use data from animal studies for updates to annual flu vaccines because we've used those shots for decades, and we understand what biomarkers to look for when gauging whether they work. These so-called correlates of protection are not as well understood for the Covid-19 vaccines. It's not just the shots that are different, Poland said. At this point in the pandemic, our immune systems are, too. Nearly all Americans have been infected with the coronavirus, vaccinated or both. Some people have had four or five doses of vaccine. \"So if you say to me, 'can you assure me that getting dose five or dose six of this new vaccine in the background of having received these previous doses is absolutely safe?' I'd say 'no, I can't.' We're extrapolating. And I think we ought to be clear about that,\" Poland said. FDA officials point out that animal studies weren't the only data they reviewed to make their decision. They considered two other lines of evidence. The first is the vaccines' track records. The same basic vaccines have now been given to hundreds of millions of people around the world. They have been shown to be extremely effective at preventing severe disease and death from Covid-19. Risks associated with mRNA vaccination are very, very low. The second line of evidence comes from bivalent vaccines that may soon be used in Europe. Earlier this year, Pfizer and Moderna presented an independent panel of experts who advise the FDA with data on a bivalent vaccine designed to target the original strain of Omicron, BA.1. That data showed that the vaccines boosted antibody responses and were well-tolerated. The UK has authorized these vaccines, but they will not be available in the US. The BA.1 strain isn't circulating any more, and the FDA asked the manufacturers to update their US shots to include BA.4 and BA.5 instead. Marks said in a briefing Wednesday that some evidence suggests that the BA.4 and BA.5 strains generate a stronger immune response than BA.1, which is another reason officials wanted to include them in the updated shots. FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said he understands that people may want to know more, but he's confident that these vaccines are safe and effective. \"It's fair for people to raise questions. But this really is the best consensus that we have among the experts that this is the best way to go. ... It's just painful to see people dying unnecessarily when there's a free treatment that would prevent their death,\" he said. \"I will be at the front of the line at the pharmacy getting my vaccination,\" said Califf, who will turn 71 next month. \"I'm very confident about this.\" In the past, tests of variant-specific vaccines have had lackluster results. It's hard to know what effect these bivalent vaccines could have. In a recent , published ahead of peer review, scientists tried to estimate this with a meta-analysis, or a study of studies. The gathered estimates of antibody levels after booster doses against the ancestral strains, as well as against specific variants, and tried to use those levels to predict how well the shots would work. They found that people got the biggest benefits from getting boosted, period. A booster against the ancestral strain of the virus that causes Covid-19 increased neutralizing antibodies 11-fold. The scientists estimated that would increase a person's protection against symptomatic infection over the next six months from 50% to 86.5%. Variant-specific boosters worked a little better, but the difference wasn't dramatic. After those shots, protection against symptomatic infection over the next six months rose to 90.2%, just a 4.6% increase. A of adverse events after mRNA booster vaccinations in adults the United States found that side effects were less common after booster doses than after second doses of the vaccine, and most were mild. About 1 in 8 adults reported a headache, fever or pain after a booster. In children and teens, after boosters were pain at the site of the injection, fatigue, headache and muscle aches. Very rarely, mRNA vaccines can cause myocarditis, or swelling in or around the heart. After more than 80 million booster doses given in the United States, the government safety surveillance systems received 37 verifiable reports of myocarditis. Most of these were in men. The highest rates of myocarditis in adults were in younger men -- ages 18 to 24. For every million booster doses given to men this age, the CDC expects about that about will have myocarditis. For adolescents, the rate is slightly higher but still extremely low: about for every million doses. Marks said that to minimize this risk, officials are directing that the vaccines be given at least two months after a previous dose. \"It seems to be associated when they're given closer to one another,\" he said. The Covid-19 vaccines were due for an update. As the coronavirus has been circulating, it has changed a lot. These changes have helped it slip past the antibodies that we made against older versions of the virus and older versions of the vaccine. As a result, it's gotten better at causing reinfections and breakthrough infections. Some of the monoclonal antibodies made to give people passive immunity against the virus have also stopped working against the new variants. The hope is that giving people updated vaccines will improve their ability to fight off the infection and shore up protection against severe disease that causes hospitalization or death. There is also some hope that updated boosters may slow the spread of the virus -- and thus the speed at which vaccine-busting variants appear. The coronavirus is changing at blistering speed. In a meeting with FDA vaccine advisers last June, Trevor Bedford, a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Reserach Center in Seattle, compared the speed of evolution of the viruses that cause Covid-19 to that of the viruses that cause influenza. Among the faster influenza viruses, he said, it takes about three years for a new strain to emerge and start showing up in testing in significant numbers. Among the variants of the virus that causes Covid-19, the Delta variant pulled off this feat in a year. Omicron did it in three to four months. So there is genuine concern that without something to slow transmission of the infection, we'll be forever stuck in catchup mode, waiting for faster and potentially more dangerous variants to emerge.

A rare agreement with the US is proof", "paragraphs": " A between the United States and China aims to draw a line under one of the biggest disputes in global business: how Chinese companies listed on Wall Street Last Friday, regulators from both sides announced an agreement that would allow US officials to inspect the audit papers of those firms, satisfying a long-running demand stateside and bringing relief to businesses and investors in each country. The breakthrough means that for now, more than 160 Chinese companies may have dodged the immediate threat of being kicked off the world's biggest stock market. Regulators appear to be wasting no time in testing the new deal. reported Wednesday that US officials had chosen Alibaba, Yum China and other companies for a first round of inspections beginning next month, citing unidentified sources. The firms did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But officials warn that the arrangement is just the first step forward on an issue that remains delicate, suggesting these Chinese companies aren't out of the woods until access is secured and a broader agreement is finalized. Experts also say it's unlikely to lead to a quick resolution of other flashpoints in US-China business relations. The agreement allows US regulators to inspect and investigate registered accounting firms in mainland China and Hong Kong that audit the books of Chinese companies. The deal is the most comprehensive of its kind ever reached between the United States and China, according to the US Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. US inspectors are expected to travel to China and Hong Kong to start on-site inspections, likely \"by mid September,\" according to Gary Gensler, chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). \"Reaching an agreement on these pilot inspections was the key test of whether the two sides could finalize a broader deal that would avoid the eventual delisting of Chinese firms from US exchanges,\" Lauren Gloudeman, director of China at Eurasia Group, told CNN Business. Drew Bernstein, co-chairman of Marcum Asia CPAs, an accounting firm, auditor and adviser for Asian companies looking to enter US markets, also believes the first big hurdle has been cleared. \"China has made it clear that they believe that enabling some of its companies to continue to access the US capital markets is in China's interests, and regulators have made some significant concessions to get to a deal,\" he said. The long list of companies at risk includes some of China's top tech giants,  ,  , and  . US regulations firms that do not comply with requests to fully open their books will be barred from trading in the United States in early 2024. That deadline, however, could be moved up. And the pressure has ramped up significantly in recent months: This year, the SEC has Chinese companies to its list of entities that could face expulsion, while have to give those businesses an ultimatum. China had previously to let overseas regulators inspect its accounting firms, citing security concerns. The tension has already led some Chinese companies to retreat from US markets. Just this month, opted to leave the New York Stock Exchange, citing low turnover and high costs. The voluntary delistings were made by China Life Insurance, PetroChina, Sinopec, Aluminum Corporation of China and Sinopec Shanghai Petrochemical. Others are trying to keep their options open. Alibaba \u2014 perhaps the most well-known Chinese company amongst Western investors \u2014 in July to upgrade its Hong Kong listing to primary status, which it expects to take place by the end of this year. The company, whose shares have traded on the New York Stock Exchange since 2014, hopes to hold dual primary listings once the change is complete. Hong Kong has emerged as a for companies looking to ease concerns over getting booted off Wall Street. \"As it takes time for the cooperation [on the new deal] to materialize, the delisting risk of US-listed Chinese stocks cannot be fully alleviated in the short term,\" according to analysts at Bocom International, the investment banking arm of Bank of Communications. Dual primary or secondary listings in Hong Kong would likely remain \"an attractive choice\" for now, they wrote in a report on Monday. Besides forcing companies to rethink their game plans, the situation has already contributed to a slowdown in share issues. US initial public offerings by Chinese companies have slumped significantly, with eight primary listings so far this year compared to 37 in the same period last year, according to data provider Dealogic. The value of those deals has also shrunk massively. So far in 2022, companies have raised just $332 million through IPOs on US markets, down from nearly $13 billion a year ago, Dealogic data shows. Other factors are driving , including the market slump that has created an overall affecting companies of all kinds. For some Chinese players, there has also been anxiety about a regulatory crackdown. Over the past year, Didi, China's biggest ride-hailing firm, has become a cautionary tale. The company in New York last year, and later after getting caught in the crackdown at home. But there could be a rebound in Chinese share issues, if the US Congress sees evidence that China is sticking with the audit deal. \"In our experience, Chinese management teams remain highly interested and motivated to list in the US, given the relatively streamlined listing process,\" Bernstein said. \"So if the IPO market recovers next year, we would expect a surge of new Chinese listings in 2023.\" Analysts remain cautious over whether the new audit deal will put companies in the clear. Goldman Sachs analysts believe there is still a roughly 50% chance of Chinese shares getting delisted. Last week, the SEC chief also warned that companies still faced ejection if their papers could not be accessed by US authorities. \"The proof will be in the pudding,\" he said in a . Confirmation of the upcoming inspections \"makes it very likely \u2014 a 90% probability \u2014 that the two sides finalize a broad agreement on inspections by the end of the year or soon after,\" Eurasia experts wrote in a report. \"The lead US regulator will not go [to] the trouble of traveling to Hong Kong if it lacks confidence in China's commitment to a deal.\" Xiaomeng Lu, director of geo-technology at Eurasia, said that Beijing could still order more state-owned enterprises to delist preemptively, \"because these firms manage information deemed sensitive to national security.\" China may choose to take that route, \"rather than be subject to annual inspections,\" her team wrote in a report. Despite the progress made, the world's top two superpowers are expected to remain at odds on other issues. \"Though the agreement is a constructive signal broadly, it does not have much feed-through to the broader bilateral relationship,\" Gloudeman, Eurasia's China director, said. \"It is hard to see a reset on the horizon, with intensifying geopolitical flashpoints like the disconnect on Taiwan policy and China's relationship with Russia. Upcoming election cycles in Taiwan and in the US risk further deterioration of the bilateral relationship.\" Bernstein, the accounting executive, said the deal pointed to the limits of decoupling, even as ties fray. \"The US-China relationship reminds me of conflict-ridden relationships where at the end of the day, they realize they can't afford to get divorced,\" he said."},

The TUC says it is the biggest study into the issue ever conducted in the United Kingdom. Among younger workers, the figures are even more troubling. About 52% of Black, brown and minority ethnic workers aged 25 to 34 years old reported suffering racism during that period, while 58% of those aged between 18 and 24 years old said the same. Racist incidents included overhearing racist jokes, being subjected to stereotyping or comments about appearance, receiving racist remarks, or outright bullying and harassment. For the report, researchers at Number Cruncher Politics conducted focus groups last year, and surveyed 1,750 Black, brown and minority ethnic workers between February and May this year. The study also found that workers are incidents of racist behavior. About 44% said they didn't report them because they \"didn't believe it would be taken seriously.\" And nearly half of all Black, brown and minority ethnic workers, or BME, said they had \"experienced at least one form of discrimination consistent with institutional racism.\" \u2014 often defined as systems which perpetuate discrimination and bias in organizations \u2014 can include being unfairly disciplined or missing out on a promotion. \"This report lifts the lid on racism in UK workplaces.

Responding to the report, Matthew Percival, the director for skills and inclusion at the Confederation of British Industry, said that the \"data shows there is still a way to go in addressing racial and ethnic equality across society. Businesses must be doing all they can to build an inclusive workplace and tackle discrimination.\" The CBI is encouraging companies to report ethnicity pay gaps and set clear targets for improving BME participation at senior levels, Percival added. A spokesperson for the UK government said: \"Our inclusive Britain action plan sets out plans to build a fairer and more inclusive society, including promoting fairness in the workplace and action to tackle the ethnicity pay gap.\""},

This is the first time updated Covid-19 vaccines have received emergency use authorization in the United States. Both are bivalent vaccines that combine the companies' original vaccine with one that targets the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron sublineages. Pfizer's updated vaccine is a 30-microgram dose authorized for people age 12 and older. Moderna's updated vaccine is a 50-microgram dose authorized for people age 18 and older. The shots can be administered after they're recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC's vaccine advisory group is scheduled to on whether to support recommending the boosters for use. Then, the CDC director must sign off on the recommendation. An OK from the CDC would mean updated boosters could be administered within days -- both to older people who may have received a booster just a few months ago and younger people who haven't been eligible for an additional booster during the latest wave of cases. The updated vaccines do not replace shots for the primary series, but they do replace the booster people older than 12 receive. \"With today's authorization, the monovalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are not authorized as booster doses for individuals 12 years of age and older,\" the FDA said. Individuals ages 12 and up are eligible for the Pfizer bivalent booster if they have received their primary series and it has been at least two months since their last vaccine dose. Individuals ages 18 and up are eligible for Moderna boosters on the same schedule. People too young to receive an updated booster can still be boosted with the earlier vaccine. The FDA said it will \"work quickly\" to evaluate future submissions for authorization of bivalent boosters for younger people. Pfizer said in a news release it expects to submit an application for authorization of its updated booster for children ages 5 through 11 in early October, and it's working to prepare an application for children ages 6 months through 4 years. \"We want to make sure that adults and the adolescents covered by this authorization are able to get the most up-to-date version of a booster vaccine, and that's why we are no longer authorizing the monovalent -- the original -- booster for administration as a booster dose to those populations,\" Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said during a news briefing. About two-thirds of the total US population is vaccinated against Covid-19 with an initial series, according to data from the CDC. But less than half of those with their initial series -- and less than a third of the total population -- has also gotten a booster. There's no plan yet to phase out the earlier vaccines used in the primary series, Marks said, but this is a \"transitional year,\" when people need to make sure they have a \"good base upon which we build ... which will help protect us against the unknown.\" \"If you've not yet received a booster dose, or it's been several months since your last booster dose, now's the time to consider getting one,\" Marks said. On Wednesday, FDA officials defended their swift emergency use authorization of the updated Covid vaccine booster. Pfizer and Moderna submitted for authorization last week. \"The public can rest assured that a great deal of care has been taken by the FDA to ensure that these updated boosters meet our rigorous safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality standards for emergency use authorization,\" Marks said. The agency has authorized these boosters after studies in mice, but ahead of the results of clinical trials in humans. This is similar to the way annual flu vaccines are tested each year, but it's a first for Covid-19 vaccines. The approach has generated some controversy among vaccine experts. In making the authorization, the agency did not call a new meeting of its independent vaccine advisers, who often weigh in on vaccine changes; the advisory group had offered its insight on updating the original vaccine in meetings over the summer. \"We have been planning for and gathering input on our approach to updated boosters since earlier this year,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said during the news briefing. \"The FDA has extensive experience with evaluating strain changes for influenza vaccines and is confident in the data supporting these latest booster authorizations.\" In addition to the animal data, the FDA said it was basing its decision on more than a year of experience with hundreds of millions of doses of mRNA vaccines given around the globe. They are also relying on human clinical trials of different bivalent vaccines that target the original Omicron strain. That vaccine has been authorized in the UK, but will not be available in the US. More than 1,400 participants were enrolled in clinical trials of the Pfizer and Moderna bivalent vaccines against BA.1. Human studies of the bivalent boosters, which combine the companies' original vaccine with one that targets the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron sublineages, have started, Marks said on Wednesday. Data from those studies is expected in another month or two. \"America is the first country in the world that has authorized a bivalent vaccine where the bivalent vaccine targets the viruses out there,\" Dr. Ashish Jha, who is leading the White House Covid-19 response, said in a phone interview with CNN on Wednesday. \"We try to do this every year for the flu. We almost never hit it on the mark. This has taken a lot of work by FDA. It's been about leaning into the science, leaning into some very good modeling. And then really demanding from the companies that they produce vaccines that are going to be that are going to be matched.\" The Omicron BA.5 subvariant has dominated transmission in the United States for more than two months. Last week, it caused 89% -- nearly 9 out of 10 -- new Covid infections in this country, according to the latest estimates from the CDC. A recent offshoot of the BA.4 variant, BA.4.6, has slowly grown in prevalence to claim second place. Across the country, it caused about 8% of new infections last week, but it has taken off more in the Midwest -- Kansas, Iowa, Missouri and Nebraska -- causing an estimated 17% of new infections there.

According to provisional data published Wednesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, life expectancy at birth dropped by nearly a year between 2020 and 2021 -- and by more than two and a half years overall since the . Life expectancy at birth fell to 76.1 years, the lowest it has been in the US since 1996, and the biggest 2-year decline in a century. Covid-19 was the driving factor, with deaths from the virus contributing to half of the decline from 2020 to 2021, according to the report from the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics. The death rate from Covid-19 was higher in 2021 than it was in 2020, so it wasn't particularly surprising that life expectancy would fall again, Bob Anderson, chief mortality statistician for the CDC, told CNN. Also, drug overdose deaths reached a record high in 2021, killing about 109,000 people. And deaths from unintentional injuries -- about half of which are due to drug overdose -- was the second-leading cause of the decline in life expectancy. Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, also said it wasn't surprising, but it is frustrating. \"It is distressing to see a continuing negative impact of drug overdose on the life expectancy of Americans. These deaths often occur in young adults and therefore represent a tragically high number of years of life lost and devastating impact on individuals, families, and communities,\" she said. \"We have the science and the tools available to help us reverse this trend and reduce the number of overdose deaths in this country. But these tools are not being used effectively.\" Even if expected, the scale of the decline is still extraordinary. In 2021, mortality rates due to influenza and pneumonia decreased, and if not for these \"offsetting effects,\" the decline in US life expectancy would have been even greater, according to the report. \"Mortality generally, mainly since the 1950s, has changed rather slowly,\" Anderson said. Changes of more than a few tenths of a year have been considered substantial. The recent decline among American Indian and Alaska Native people is particularly \"astounding,\" Anderson said. The life expectancy for this group plunged by nearly 2 years between 2020 and 2021 and a startling 6.6 years since 2019 -- more than twice as much as it did for the total US population. At 65.2 years, the life expectancy for American Indians in 2021 was equal to the overall US life expectancy in 1944. \"When I saw that, in the report, I just -- my jaw dropped,\" Anderson said. \"It was hard enough to fathom a 2.7 year decline over 2 years overall. But then to see a 6.6 year decline for the American Indian population -- it just shows the substantial impact that the pandemic has had on that population.\" Deaths from Covid-19 directly were the leading contributor to the decline in life expectancy among American Indian people in 2021, but deaths due to drug overdose and other unintentional injuries, as well as chronic liver disease, which is often caused by alcohol abuse, were nearly equal contributors for this group. When it comes to the pandemic, Anderson said, \"I'm not just talking about Covid-19 necessarily, but also the other factors that seem to have increased during the pandemic.\" Experts say the pandemic exacerbated already existing disparities for American Indians and others. Dr. Matthew Clark, a chief medical officer with the Indian Health Service, said the findings of the new CDC report are concerning, but it has been known that American Indian and Alaska Native people \"suffer disproportionately with regard to health outcomes for a broad variety of conditions.\" There are \"unique aspects to addressing health outcomes\" in these communities, he said, and this data should be viewed as a \"call to action, an opportunity to redouble our efforts\" to address a broad range of factors that impact the health of these populations and engage with tribal communities to find solutions. \"Even in the midst of a very concerning report like this, I do think that there's hope,\" Clark said, and \"there is an opportunity to move the needle in the other direction.\" To do that, the goal should be to explore the root causes of those disparities for American Indians and others, said Ruben Cantu, an associate program director with Prevention Institute, a nonprofit focused on health equity. \"A lot of the talk is going to be around the pandemic,\" Cantu said. \"But we need to think about what has driven the conditions that have allowed certain communities to be more vulnerable\" in the first place, like crowded housing, poor access to health care and low-income jobs that don't allow for paid sick leave. A , published as a preprint in June, found that the decrease in life expectancy in the US over the course of the pandemic was \"highly racialized\" and substantially larger than it was for a set of comparable countries. In fact, that study found that life expectancy increased slightly between 2020 and 2021 for the set of 21 peer countries. The new data from the CDC highlights differences in life-expectancy trends by race and ethnicity, as well as by gender. In the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic, life expectancy declined least among White people. In the second year of the pandemic, however, this group saw the second-biggest decline in life expectancy -- and deaths due to Covid-19 contributed to the drop among White people more than any other racial or ethnic group. Once the most vaccinated group, the share of the White population that is fully vaccinated with their initial series now lags behind that of the Black, Hispanic and Asian populations, CDC data shows. Life expectancy in 2021 was highest among both Asian women (85.6 years) and men (81.2 years), the CDC data shows. Hispanic women were the only other group with a life expectancy greater than 80 years. In the total US population, life expectancy fell more among men than among women in 2021, widening a gap that has been growing over the past decade. The disparity in life expectancy between men (73.2 years) and women (79.1 years) is now nearly six years. The life expectancy for American Indian men in 2021 was 61.5 years, lower than any other group. Black men had the next lowest, at 66.7 years. A recent project by the Prevention Institute focused on the mental health and well-being of men and boys. It found that men and boys of color -- especially Black and Native American men -- \"start out with higher rates of trauma and mental health challenges,\" Cantu said, which can make them more vulnerable to other conditions. \"Over the last five or six years, we've heard a lot more about diseases of despair -- things like substance use, alcoholism and suicide -- and a lot of those things are connected,\" he said. \"It helps to point out how vulnerable certain communities can be to a lot of other conditions.\""},

Most have a rigid structure, but the Ironhand is soft, like a regular glove. \"When you have the glove on, it provides strength and reduces the effort needed when lifting objects,\" says Mikael Wester, Bioservo's marketing director. \"It's all in order to reduce fatigue and prevent strain injuries in the long run.\" The system consists of a backpack, which houses the power pack, and artificial tendons that connect to the glove. There are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object. A remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip. Wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry, using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses. Each Ironhand system costs around \u20ac6,000 ($7,275). The device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer's risk of developing strain injuries. According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, work-related neck and upper limb disorders are the , costing national economies up to 2% of their gross national product. The glove was originally intended for workers in a very different setting to the factory floor. NASA developed an early version of the technology, called \"Robo-Glove,\" to help astronauts grasp objects and carry out work in space. Bioservo licensed the design in 2016 and then partnered with auto manufacturer General Motors (GM) to develop the glove for its workers. \"Ergonomics is really the field of trying to fit the jobs to the workers, instead of the workers having to conform and adapt to the job,\" says Stephen Krajcarski, a senior manager with GM's ergonomics team. \"By using tools such as the Ironhand we are really trying to mitigate any potential concerns or physical demands that may eventually cause a medical concern for that individual operator.\" Krajcarski says GM has helped Bioservo to test and improve the Ironhand by piloting it in a variety of jobs at its manufacturing plants. He says some workers have found it easy to use but adds that it's not suitable for all situations. The Ironhand is just one of the exoskeletons GM is looking into. According to market research firm ABI Research, the exoskeleton market will grow from . \"If you look at exoskeletons, this is just one of the tools that are out there,\" says Krajcarski. \"But this is an exciting technology.\" This story has been updated to correct the cost of the Ironhand system."},

At least 155,000 workers are currently on strike, including staff at the country's postal service, and engineers and call center workers for telecom provider  . Two rail unions on Wednesday announced further strike action by 14,000 of their members later this month. More strikes could be on the way this fall, threatening unprecedented disruption across a range of industries. Teachers, doctors and nurses are set to vote on strike action in the coming weeks. Unions could even coordinate their walkouts. Unite and Unison \u2014 the country's biggest unions with 2.7 million members in total \u2014 are calling for others to join them in synchronized action. It is one of the most significant waves of industrial unrest the United Kingdom has seen since the \"winter of discontent\" in the late 1970s when rampant inflation pushed workers to stage mass walkouts. About 7.9 million working days were lost between November 1978 and February 1979, according to the Office for National Statistics. Soaring prices and years of stagnant wages are the backdrop to this year's disputes. Consumer price inflation hit a 40-year high of 10.1% in July. Forecasters at Citigroup said last week that inflation could at the start of next year, and Goldman Sachs thinks it could even hit 22% if gas prices don't fall soon. Workers are already feeling the strain. Average real wages, which account for inflation, fell by 3% between April and June, compared with the same period last year. That was the biggest hit to in more than 20 years. Real wages barely increased in the decade to 2020. And average household energy bills \u2014 which have already risen 54% this year \u2014 are set to increase by another 80% to \u00a33,549 ($4,124) in October. According to estimates by Auxilione, a research firm, average bills could hit \u00a37,700 ($8,949) next April \u2014 equivalent to a \u00a3642 ($746) monthly bill. Workers are mobilizing in response. The United Kingdom has \"never seen [this] level of disruption across all sectors,\" Chiara Benassi, an associate professor in comparative employment relations at King's College London, told CNN Business. In recent months, the has acted as a \"trigger\" for widespread grievances that have been building up over a long period of time, she said. \"These strikes affect not only [what] we would say [are] manual occupations or low-skilled jobs that more evidently would struggle with the cost-of-living crisis, but also highly-skilled jobs like junior doctors, British Telecom engineers, barristers, academics, teachers,\" Benassi said. Deepsha Agrawal, a junior doctor at Oxford University Hospital, told CNN Business that her colleagues are pushing for a bigger pay increase than the 2% the government agreed back in 2019. \"It's quite demoralizing, because the current inflation rate is expected to go very high next year,\" she said. Her union, the British Medical Association, will soon ballot its members over whether to strike. Agrawal believes that they will. Many of her colleagues feel they cannot afford to buy houses or have children. \"[Junior doctors] are as hardworking and as educated as other professionals. We are struggling and we are paying a price out of our pocket to do the work that we do,\" she said. \"With what happened during Covid, we should be rewarded for what we did, not punished for what we do every day,\" Agrawal added. The current wave of industrial action cannot easily be compared to the 1970s and 1980s \u2014 if only because the government stopped tracking numbers of striking workers, and working days lost, during the Covid-19 pandemic. It recently started collecting data again, and will provide an update this month. Richard Hyman, a professor of industrial relations at the London School of Economics, told CNN Business that this years' strikes would pale in comparison to those of earlier decades simply because union membership has fallen so dramatically. \"Around about 1980, more than half the workforce was in a trade union. Today it's less than a quarter, so there's been a big decline,\" Hyman said. Strikes used to be concentrated in sectors which have \"more or less disappeared\" like coal mining and steel, Hyman added. Now, union membership is more heavily skewed towards the public sector, or big utility companies that used to be owned by the government. \"There's been the rise in precarious work, so that a growing proportion of workers simply don't have a proper job any more so are not in a position to go on strike,\" Hyman added. Benassi said that during the 1980s, when UK manufacturing industry was shrinking rapidly, strikes were often about the survival of key sectors. Between 1984 and 1985, thousands of coal miners went on strike after Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government threatened to close many of the country's coal pits. \"[Today] it's a bit different, because we are talking only about pay. Of course, the disputes at the time were also about pay but it was also about, for example, not closing down the mines,\" she said. This year's strike wave is significant, though, for the breadth of industries affected and because of the hoops UK workers have to jump through to down tools legally. \"Striking in the UK is very difficult. It's way more difficult than anywhere in western Europe, especially after the Trade Union Bill in 2016,\" she said. The legislation, which came into force in 2017, made it much harder for unions to call a strike by requiring at least 50% of members to take part in the ballot, and at least 40% of the votes cast to be in favor of strike action. The law also increased the period of notice unions must give employers of their intention to strike from one week to two. In comparison, Benassi said that neither a ballot nor a notice period are required in Germany. Liz Truss, UK foreign secretary and favorite to succeed Boris Johnson as prime minister next week, has said she would bring in even tougher limits on unions' powers to call a strike. She has proposed raising the support threshold for strike action from 40% to 50% of votes cast, and extend the notice period to a month. \"I will take a tough line on trade union action,\" Truss told in July. Liz Truss' leadership campaign declined to comment when contacted by CNN Business. \"There's quite an adversarial campaign from the side of the government to say well we'll send agency workers to replace the workers on strike, or they should go back to work immediately, or there has already been a pay rise,\" Manuela Galetto, associate professor of employment relations at the University of Warwick's Business School, told CNN Business. Despite the obstacles, workers may feel more emboldened to strike at the moment, given the tight labor market, she said. UK unemployment was 3.8% between April and June this year, ONS data shows. That's its lowest level in more than 50 years. There was also one unemployed person for every job vacancy \u2014 a record low. \"It means that many workers are in work and they are in a good position to ask for [a pay] increase. They cannot be easily replaced [at a macro level],\" Galetto said."},

{"url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2021/07/14/world/tusimple-autonomous-truck-spc-intl/index.html", "title": "There's a shortage of truckers, but TuSimple thinks it has a solution: no driver needed", "paragraphs": " Right now, there's a shortage of truck drivers in the and , exacerbated by the e-commerce boom brought on by the pandemic. One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks, and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one. Among them is San Diego-based TuSimple. Founded in 2015, TuSimple has completed about 2 million miles of road tests with its 70 prototype trucks across the US, China and Europe. Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology, TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world's largest truck manufacturers -- Navistar in the US and Traton, Volkswagen's trucking business, in Europe -- to design and build fully autonomous models, which it hopes to launch by 2024. TuSimple's latest road test involved hauling fresh produce 951 miles, from Nogales, Arizona to Oklahoma City. The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver, but for the bulk of the route -- from Tucson to Dallas -- the truck drove itself. \"Today, because the system is not fully ready, we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we're testing, but we drove in full autonomy: the driver wasn't touching the wheel,\" said Cheng Lu, TuSimple's president and CEO. The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver, mostly because a truck doesn't need to sleep. \"In the US, a driver can only work 11 hours a day. We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation,\" said Lu. That, of course, negates the advantage of an autonomous system, so the idea is that once TuSimple's trucks hit the market, there will be no need to have anyone onboard. Unlike self-driving cars, which are a still , TuSimple trucks won't be required to operate in bustling city traffic, but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company's own software.  \"We collect data from the roads, and we create this very detailed, high definition map of each route. That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles,\" said Lu. As a result, TuSimple's trucks will only be able to self-drive along these pre-mapped trade corridors, which Lu calls \"virtual railroads,\" and nowhere else. According to the company, in the US 80% of goods travel through just 10% of the nation's trade corridors, so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business. TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas, and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024. Its plans are dependent on state legislation, however, because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads.  The technology will add about $50,000 to the cost of a truck, making the final price roughly $200,000. According to Lu, that's still cheaper than paying for a human driver. \"If you take $50,000 and divide it by 1 million miles, the average lifespan of a truck, that means you're adding five cents per mile. But you're saving the cost of a human driver, which based on average US wages is about $80,000 to $120,000 per year -- or 80 cents to $1.20 per mile. Today, the direct labor cost is about 50% of the cost of operating a truck,\" he said. That doesn't mean driverless trucks will take away jobs, according to Lu. By focusing on the \"middle mile,\" rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods, TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers, while at the same time protecting existing jobs. \"A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day -- that's not what autonomy is meant for. We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver, even if they enter the workforce today,\" said Lu. Instead, TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers, which involve long stretches of monotonous driving. \"Take Phoenix to El Paso: that's a six-hour drive. A person cannot make the round trip, because it's more than 11 hours. But the truck can go back and forth all day, the most mundane job that drivers don't want to do. That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile (pickup and delivery).They get to work a full day, which is a more efficient use of their time, and they get to go home at night to their family,\" said Lu. Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased, TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests, without a human safety driver in the cabin at all, before the end of the year. The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024. Lu says that 7,000 have been reserved in the US alone.  TuSimple has prominent competitors, such as Google spinoff Waymo and Uber-backed Aurora, but those are working on a wider range of self-driving vehicles, including passenger cars. TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks, like US companies Plus and Embark.  Grayson Brulte, an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte & Co., believes TuSimple is on the right track. \"The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose-built for trucking. They're not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class-8 trucks. These are different skills and different systems altogether,\" he said.  Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits. The company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers, and can see farther down the road, even at night. \"In the US every year there are about 5,000 fatalities involving trucks, and most are due to human error,\" said Lu. \"The truck doesn't get tired, doesn't watch a movie or look at a phone. It doesn't get distracted.\""}
