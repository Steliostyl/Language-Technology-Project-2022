Core inflation peaked at 6.5% in March and has been nudging down since.</p>", "<p>On a monthly basis, headline CPI rose 1.3% and core CPI was up 0.7%, compared to respective estimates of 1.1% and 0.5%.</p>", "<p>Taken together, the numbers seemed to counter the narrative that inflation may be peaking, as the gains were based across a variety of categories.</p>", "<p>\"CPI delivered another shock, and as painful as June's higher number is, equally as bad is the broadening sources of inflation,\" said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. \"Though CPI's spike is led by energy and food prices, which are largely global problems, prices continue to mount for domestic goods and services, from shelter to autos to apparel.\"</p>", "<p>Energy prices surged 7.5% on the month and were up 41.6% on a 12-month basis. The food index increased 1%, while shelter costs, which make up about one-third of the CPI rose 0.6% for the month and were up 5.6% annually. This was the sixth straight month that food at home rose at least 1%.</p>", "<p>Rental costs rose 0.8% in June, the largest monthly increase since April 1986, according to the BLS.</p>", "<p>Stock market futures slumped following the data while government bond yields surged.</p>", "<p>Much of inflation rise came from gasoline prices, which increased 11.2% on the month and just shy of 60% for the 12-month period. Electricity costs rose 1.7% and 13.7%, respectively. New and used vehicle prices posted respective gains of 0.7% and 1.6%.</p>", "<p>Medical-care costs climbed 0.7% on the month, propelled by a 1.9% increase in dental services, the largest monthly change ever recorded for that sector in data that goes back to 1995.</p>", "<p>Airline fares were one of the few areas seeing a decline, falling 1.8% in June though still up 34.1% from a year ago. The meat, poultry, fish and eggs category also dropped 0.4% for the month but is up 11.7% on an annual basis.</p>", "<p>The increases marked another tough month for consumers, who have been suffering through soaring prices for everything from airline tickets to used cars to bacon and eggs.</p>", "<p>For workers, the numbers meant another hit to the wallet, as inflation-adjusted incomes, based on average hourly earnings, fell 1% for the month and were down 3.6% from a year ago, according to a separate BLS release.</p>", "<p>Policymakers have struggled to come up with answer to a situation that is rooted in multiple factors, including clogged supply chains, outsized demand for goods over services, and trillions of dollars in <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/coronavirus/\">Covid</a>-related stimulus spending that has made consumers both flush with cash and confronted with the highest prices since the early days of the Reagan administration.</p>", "<p>Federal Reserve officials have instituted a series of interest rate increases that have taken benchmark short-term borrowing costs up by 1.5 percentage points. The central bank is expected to continue hiking until inflation comes closer to its 2% longer-run target rate.</p>", "<p>The inflation reading could push the Fed into an even more aggressive position.</p>", "<p>Traders upped their bets on the pace of interest rate increases ahead.

President <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/joe-biden/\">Joe Biden</a> has called on gas station owners to lower prices.</p>", "<p>The administration and leading Democrats also have blamed what they call greedy corporations for using the pandemic as an excuse to raise prices. Corporate profits, however, have increased just 1.3% in aggregate since the second quarter of 2021, when inflation took hold.</p>", "<p>In a statement following the report, Biden said \"tackling inflation is my top priority,\" and repeated previous calls for oil and gas companies to lower prices and Congress to vote on legislation he said will reduce costs for various products and services.</p>", "<p>There is some reason to think the July inflation numbers will cool.</p>", "<p>Gasoline prices have come down from their June peak, with a gallon of regular falling to $4.64, a 4.7% drop for the month, according to Energy Information Administration data.</p>", "<p>The S&amp;P GSCI commodities index, a broad-based measure of prices for multiple goods, has fallen 7.3% in July, though it remains up 17.2% for the year.

Then in the second round, the candidates with the fewest votes are eliminated. These rounds of voting continue until two candidates remain, which is expected to happen by the end of this week.</p>", "<p>When two candidates remain, all the members of the Conservative Party (some 200,000 people) are asked to vote by postal ballot on their favorite candidate. The winner is expected to be announced on Sept. 5.</p>", "<p>The eight candidates include well-known faces, such as former Finance Minister Rishi Sunak \u2014 one of the favorites to win \u2014 and Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and new Finance Minister Nadhim Zahawi, as well as those with less high-profiles such as Tom Tugendhat, Suella Braverman and Kemi Badenoch.</p>", "<p>Former Health Minister Jeremy Hunt is also in the race, as well as Penny Mordaunt, international trade minister, another of the favorites who's popular with grassroots party activists. Sajid Javid, former health secretary, withdrew from the leadership race on Tuesday.</p>", "<p>Showing some division among Tory MPs and those among the more grassroots Conservative Party members and activists, Penny\u00a0Mordaunt, a former defense secretary, topped a poll of Tory party members this week on who should be the next leader, with 20% of the vote.</p>", "<p>Ex-local government minister Kemi Badenoch was seen with 19% of the vote, followed by Rishi Sunak on 12%, according to the poll of over 800 Tory party members on Tuesday by website Conservative Home.</p>", "<p>Tuesday night, the eight candidates had 12 minutes each to try to convince their fellow MPs why they should be the next leader of the party and the country.
