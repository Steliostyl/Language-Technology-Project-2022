{"article_title": "Covid hospitalizations have doubled since May as omicron BA.5 sweeps U.S., but deaths remain low", "article_tag": "Health and Science", "author": "Spencer Kimball", "article_datetime": "2022-07-12T17:27:51+0000", "paragraphs": ["<p>People hospitalized with Covid-19 have doubled since early May as the even more transmissible omicron BA.5 subvariant has caused another wave of infection across the country, U.S. health officials said Tuesday.</p>", "<p>But deaths from Covid still remain relatively low given the number of infections right now, the officials said. Dr. Ashish Jha, who coordinates the Biden administration's Covid response, said deaths from the virus are not increasing at the same rate they once did due to the availability of vaccines and the antiviral treatment Paxlovid.</p>", "<p>\"Even in the face of BA.5, the tools we have continue to work. We are at a point in the pandemic where most Covid-19 deaths are preventable,\" Jha told reporters during a pandemic update Tuesday. But he said the number of deaths still remains unacceptably high given the fact that the U.S. has vaccines and treatments to prevent the worst outcomes.</p>", "<p>More than 16,600 total patients were hospitalized with Covid across the U.S. as of Saturday, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Currently, an average of more than 5,000 people have been admitted to the hospital with Covid every day compared with an average of more than 2,000 daily admissions for the week ending May 1, according to the CDC.</p>", "<p>The U.S. is currently reporting an average of nearly 104,000 Covid infections per day as of Sunday which is almost the double the number of reported cases at the start of May, according to the data. White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said the reported infections are clearly an undercount because many people are using at-home tests that aren't reflected in the data. Fauci said the real number of cases might be anywhere between 300,000 and 500,000 new infections a day.</p>", "<p>Deaths from the virus have remained relatively low at about 280 fatalities a day on average as of Sunday, according to CDC data. At the height of the winter omicron wave, an average of nearly 2,700 people were dying from Covid a day.</p>", "<p>\"The ratio of hospitalization, ICU and death to cases is much lower now than it was many months ago,\" Fauci said.</p>", "<p>The omicron BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants now make up 80% of Covid infections across the U.S., with BA.5 emerging as the dominant version of the virus. Fauci said BA.5 is more transmissible than past variants and it substantially evades the protective antibodies triggered by vaccines, but the shots are still generally protecting against severe disease. In other words, people who are fully vaccinated might get infected and have mild to moderate symptoms, but they are unlikely to be hospitalized and even more unlikely to die from Covid.</p>", "<p>Fauci said BA.5 doesn't appear to carry a great risk of severe disease compared with other omicron subvariants. But as cases increase due to its greater transmissibility, some people will end up in the hospital or ICU, he said.</p>", "<p>People who caught the previous omicron variants, BA.1 and BA.2, are likely still at risk of infection from BA.4 and BA.5, according Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the CDC. Walensky said the current omicron wave will likely play out differently around the country depending on how much immunity communities have from vaccination, boosting and prior infection.</p>", "<p>Jha encouraged all Americans to stay up to date on their shots and said people ages 50 and older should get their fourth dose. He also said people who test positive should consult with their health-care provider about receiving Paxlovid, Pfizer's oral antiviral treatment. People should also consider getting tested for Covid before attending any large indoor events or visiting with individuals who are at high risk like people with weak immune systems.</p>", "<p>The Biden administration is also discussing whether the broader population should be eligible for a second booster shot, though that decision ultimately rests with the Food and Drug Administration and the CDC, Jha said. The FDA told the vaccine makers last month to change the formula in their shots to target the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants, as well as the original virus strain that first emerged in Wuhan, China, ahead of a possible fall booster campaign.</p>", "<p>U.S. health officials are worried the country faces another major surge in infection this fall as immunity from the vaccines wanes and people spend more time indoors to escape the colder weather. Jha said the U.S. has placed one order with Pfizer for 105 million doses of the updated vaccine. The U.S. is also in discussions with other companies for additional shots, he said.</p>", "<p>\"Obviously, that will not be enough for all Americans,\" said Jha, who has repeatedly warned that the U.S. might have to ration vaccines to those who face the highest risk from the virus this fall if Congress does not approve more funding for the pandemic response.</p>", "<p>Negotiations over a Covid funding packaged have been stalled for months over Republican opposition to the White House's original $22.5 billion price tag. The Senate struck a bipartisan deal for $10 billion to buy vaccines and treatments, but that package has stalled as GOP lawmakers and some Democrats demand the Biden administration re-implement a pandemic-era public health law that deported asylum seekers and other migrants attempting to cross the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>"], "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/12/covid-hospitalizations-have-doubled-since-may-as-omicron-bapoint5-sweeps-us-but-deaths-remain-low.html"},

{"article_title": "Here are four past cases Twitter and Elon Musk's lawyers will be examining as they head to court", "article_tag": "Tech", "author": "Alex Sherman", "article_datetime": "2022-07-12T17:50:54+0000", "paragraphs": ["<p>After billionaire Elon Musk said he was terminating his acquisition of Twitter, the social media company countered by citing a contract provision that's often called upon when one party tries to back out of a deal.</p>", "<p>The clause, known as specific performance, is <a href=\"https://constructiondefect.com/what-is-specific-performance-and-when-is-it-available-in-a-real-estate-contract/\" target=\"_blank\">often used in real estate cases</a> to prevent buyers and sellers from calling off deals without good reason. But it's also included in corporate merger agreements as a way to force either a buyer or seller to close on a deal, barring material breaches such as fraud.</p>", "<p>In notifying Twitter of his plans to end the deal <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000110465922078413/tm2220599d1_ex99-p.htm\" target=\"_blank\">on Friday</a>, Musk's lawyers made three arguments for why Twitter breached its contract. First, they claim Twitter fraudulently reported the number of spam accounts<strong>, </strong>which the company has long estimated to be about 5% of users. Musk would need to prove the number of so-called bots is much higher and show a \"material adverse effect\" on Twitter's business for grounds to end the deal.</p>", "<p>Second, Musk's lawyers say Twitter \"failed to provide much of the data and information\" Musk requested, breaching a contract term that specifies Twitter must provide reasonable access to \"properties, books and records of the company and its subsidiaries.\"</p>", "<p>Lastly, Musk's lawyers argue Twitter did not comply with another contract term that required the company to get consent before deviating from its ordinary course of business. Musk cites Twitter's decision to fire two \"high ranking\" employees, laying off a third of its talent acquisition team and instituting a general hiring freeze as examples of decisions made without his consultation.</p>", "<p>The Delaware Court of Chancery, a non-jury court that primarily hears corporate cases based on shareholder lawsuits and other internal affairs, has ruled on a number of cases where a company cited the specific performance clause to force a sale. None were nearly as large as Musk's Twitter deal \u2014 $44 billion \u2014 and the details underpinning them differ as well. </p>", "<p>Still,<strong> </strong>past cases can provide context for <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/11/8-ways-the-elon-musk-twitter-saga-could-end.html\">how the Musk-Twitter dispute might end</a>.</p>", "<p><a href=\"https://casetext.com/case/in-re-ibp-inc-v-tyson-foods-inc\" target=\"_blank\">In this 2001 case</a>, Tyson agreed to acquire IBP, a meat distributor, for $30 per share, or $3.2 billion, after winning a bidding war. But when Tyson and IBP's businesses both suffered following the agreement, Tyson tried to get out of the deal. Tyson argued there were hidden financial problems at IBP.</p>", "<p>Judge Leo Strine found no evidence that IBP had materially breached the contract, instead claiming Tyson simply had \"buyer's regret.\" That didn't justify calling off a deal, the judge ruled.</p>", "<p>Strine ruled Tyson had to buy IBP given the contract's specific performance clause.</p>", "<p>\"Specific performance is the decisively preferable remedy for Tyson's breach, as it is the only method by which to adequately redress the harm threatened to IBP and its stockholders,\" Strine wrote.</p>", "<p>More than 20 years later, Tyson still owns IBP. </p>", "<p>Still, the Tyson deal differs in a few key ways. Tyson hoped a judge would allow it to walk away from the deal in part because of significant deterioration to IBP's business after the agreement was signed. Musk is arguing false and vague information about spam accounts should allow him to walk.</p>", "<p>Also, unlike Tyson's deal for IBP, Musk's acquisition of Twitter involves billions of dollars in external financing. It's unclear how a decision in favor of Twitter would affect potential funding for a deal, or if that could impact closing.</p>", "<p>Strine now works Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/11/twitter-says-musks-request-to-terminate-the-deal-is-invalid.html\">the firm Twitter hired</a> to argue its case to the Delaware Chancery Court.</p>", "<p><a href=\"https://courts.delaware.gov/Opinions/Download.aspx?id=313600\" target=\"_blank\">In this 2020 case</a>, a South Korean financial services company agreed to buy 15 U.S. hotels from AB Stable, a subsidiary of Anbang Insurance Group, a Chinese company, for $5.8 billion. The deal was signed in September 2019 and scheduled to close in April 2020.</p>", "<p>The buyer argued Covid-19 shutdowns were cause for a material adverse effect on the deal. The seller sued for specific performance.</p>", "<p>Judge J. Travis Laster found that hotel shutdowns and dramatic capacity reductions breached the \"ordinary course\" of business clause, and ruled that the buyer could get out of the deal.</p>", "<p>The Delaware Supreme Court <a href=\"https://courts.delaware.gov/Opinions/Download.aspx?id=327380\" target=\"_blank\">affirmed the decision in 2021.</a></p>", "<p>In another Covid-19 related case, LVMH originally agreed to buy jewelry maker Tiffany <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/25/lvmh-confirms-deal-to-acquire-tiffany-for-16-billion.html\">for $16.2 billion in November 2019.</a> LVMH then attempted to scrap the deal in September 2020 during the pandemic, before it was set to close in November. Tiffany sued for specific performance.</p>", "<p>In this case, a judge never issued a ruling, because the two sides agreed to a lowered price to account for the drop in demand during the Covid-19 global economic pullback. LVMH agreed to <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiffany-lvmh-near-agreement-on-new-deal-terms-11603899275\" target=\"_blank\">pay $15.8 billion for Tiffany in October 2020.</a> The deal closed in Jan. 2021.</p>", "<p>In this <a href=\"https://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/wsj071227-lb-finishline_headwind.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2007 case,</a> footwear retailer Finish Line initially agreed to buy <a href=\"//www.cnbc.com/quotes/GCO\" target=\"_blank\">Genesco</a> for $1.5 billion in June 2007 with a closing date of Dec. 31, 2007. Finish Line attempted to terminate the deal in September 2007, claiming Genesco \"committed securities fraud and fraudulently induced Finish Line to enter into the deal by not providing material information\" concerning earnings projections.</p>", "<p>As with the Tyson case, the Delaware Chancery Court ruled Genesco had met its obligations, and that Finish Line simply had buyer's remorse for paying too much. Markets had begun to crash in mid-2007 during the start of the housing and financial crisis.</p>", "<p>But rather than going through with the deal, both sides agreed to terminate the transaction with Finish Line paying Genesco damages.

But as infections have risen substantially over the last several weeks, the organization is expected to consider whether to issue its highest alert when the emergency committee reconvenes next week.</p>", "<p>\"The emergency committee for monkeypox will reconvene next week and look at trends, how effective the countermeasures are, and make recommendations\" to countries and communities confronting the outbreak, the WHO's director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said in a virtual press conference.</p>", "<p>The WHO did not say which day or days the committee will be meeting in emergency session.</p>", "<p>About 9,200 cases of monkeypox have been reported across 63 countries so far this year, up from just over 6,000 as of July 4, the agency said. Three deaths from the virus have been reported this year.</p>", "<p>Most people during this most recent outbreak are recovering from monkeypox in two to four weeks, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But the virus causes a painful rash that can spread all over the body. People who have caught the virus said the rash, which looks like pimples or blisters, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-health-and-wellness/lesions-headaches-debilitating-pain-gay-men-monkeypox-share-stories-rcna36789\" target=\"_blank\">can be very painful.</a></p>", "<p>The WHO last issued a <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/11/who-declares-the-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-pandemic.html\">global health emergency in January 2020 in response to the Covid-19 outbreak</a> and the following March <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/11/who-declares-the-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-pandemic.html\">declared it a pandemic</a>. There's no official process for the WHO to declare a pandemic under its emergency regulations, which means the term is loosely defined. In 2020, the agency declared Covid a pandemic in an effort to warn complacent governments about the \"alarming levels of spread and severity\" of the virus.</p>", "<p>In contrast to Covid, monkeypox is not a new virus. Scientists first discovered monkeypox in 1958 in captive monkeys used for research and confirmed the first case of a human infected with the virus in 1970 in the nation of Zaire, now called the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Monkeypox is in the same virus family as smallpox, though it causes milder disease. The WHO and national health agencies have decades of experience fighting smallpox, which was declared eradicated in 1980. The successful fight against smallpox could provide health officials with important knowledge to combat monkeypox.</p>", "<p>The current monkeypox outbreak is highly unusual because it is spreading widely in North American and European nations where the virus is not usually found. Europe is the global epicenter of the outbreak, reporting more than 80% of confirmed infections worldwide in 2022. The U.S. has reported more than 760 cases across 37 states, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico.</p>", "<p>Historically, monkeypox has spread at low levels in remote parts of West and Central Africa where rodents and other animals carried the virus. Transmission between people was relatively rare in the past, with the virus normally jumping from animals to humans. The WHO has said the international community did not invest enough resources in fighting monkeypox in Africa before the current outbreak.</p>"], "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/12/who-to-decide-if-monkeypox-is-a-global-health-threat-next-week.html"},

The firm launched its first gadget last summer, a set of <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/27/oneplus-founder-carl-pei-nothing-ear-1.html\">wireless earbuds called Ear 1</a> and has sold 560,000 units so far.</p>", "<p>On the face of it, Phone 1 is similar to <a href=\"//www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL\" target=\"_blank\">Apple's</a> <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/14/apple-event-iphone-live-updates.html\">latest iPhones</a>.
